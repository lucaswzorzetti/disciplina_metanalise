J	Miyasaka, Hitoshi; Genkai-Kato, Motomi								Seasonal change in the gut clearance rate of three stonefly species in a Japanese stream								ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH				24	1			231	234		10.1007/s11284-008-0494-0				JAN 2009	2009	We measured seasonal changes in the gut clearance rate of three stonefly species in a stream. The rate declined with water temperature. Based on the gut clearance rate obtained here, we estimated the half-reduction time of gut contents and consumption rate of stoneflies on algae. Irrespective of stonefly species, the half-reduction time in winter (2 days) was twice as long as that in summer (1 day). The areal consumption rates of stoneflies varied depending on species and season. These results imply that the seasonal consumption impact of aquatic insects can be different, despite their daily ration being similar among species.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0912-3814	1440-1703		WOS:000261956100025		
J	Walker, Ryan; Wilder, Shawn M.; Gonzalez, Angelica L.					Gonzalez, Angelica L./0000-0002-4636-6329			Temperature dependency of predation: Increased killing rates and prey mass consumption by predators with warming								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				10	18			9696	9706		10.1002/ece3.6581		AUG 2020		SEP 2020	2020	Temperature dependency of consumer-resource interactions is fundamentally important for understanding and predicting the responses of food webs to climate change. Previous studies have shown temperature-driven shifts in herbivore consumption rates and resource preference, but these effects remain poorly understood for predatory arthropods. Here, we investigate how predator killing rates, prey mass consumption, and macronutrient intake respond to increased temperatures using a laboratory and a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Ectothermic predators, wolf spiders (Pardosa sp.), in the lab experiment, were exposed to increased temperatures and different prey macronutrient content (high lipid/low protein and low lipid/high protein) to assess changes in their killing rates and nutritional demands. Additionally, we investigate prey mass and lipid consumption by spiders under contrasting temperatures, along an elevation gradient. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment between low (420 masl; 26 degrees C) and high (2,100 masl; 15 degrees C) elevations in the Ecuadorian Andes, using wild populations of two common orb-weaver spider species (Leucauge sp. and Cyclosa sp.) present along the elevation gradient. We found that killing rates of wolf spiders increased with warmer temperatures but were not significantly affected by prey macronutrient content, although spiders consumed significantly more lipids from lipid-rich prey. The field reciprocal transplant experiment showed no consistent predator responses to changes in temperature along the elevational gradient. Transplanting Cyclosa sp. spiders to low- or high-elevation sites did not affect their prey mass or lipid consumption rate, whereas Leucauge sp. individuals increased prey mass consumption when transplanted from the high to the low warm elevation. Our findings show that increases in temperature intensify predator killing rates, prey consumption, and lipid intake, but the responses to temperature vary between species, which may be a result of species-specific differences in their hunting behavior and sensitivity to temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000561181800001	33005340

These interactions can be altered directly by changing consumption rates, or indirectly by altering growth rates and size asymmetries among individuals that in turn affect feeding. Understanding these processes is particularly important for intraspecific interactions, as direct and indirect changes may exacerbate antagonistic interactions. We examined the effect of temperature on activity rate, growth and intraspecific size asymmetries, and how these temperature dependencies affected cannibalism in Lestes congener, a damselfly with marked intraspecific variation in size. Temperature increased activity rates and exacerbated differences in body size by increasing growth rates. Increased activity and changes in body size interacted to increase cannibalism at higher temperatures. We argue that our results are likely to be general to species with life-history stages that vary in their temperature dependencies, and that the effects of climate change on communities may depend on the temperature dependencies of intraspecific interactions.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000407093800014	28515331

Despite extensive research looking at the factors underlying foraging interactions, there remains ongoing controversy about how temperature and body size control the functional response parameters space clearance (or attack) rate and handling time. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature, consumer mass, and resource mass using the largest compilation of functional responses yet assembled. This compilation contains 2,083 functional response curves covering a wide range of foragers and prey types, environmental conditions, and habitats. After accounting for experimental arena size, dimensionality of the foraging interaction, and consumer taxon, we find that both space clearance rate and handling time are optimized at intermediate temperatures (a unimodal rather than monotonic response), suggesting that the response to global climate change depends on the location of the consumer's current temperature relative to the optimum. We further confirm that functional responses are higher and steeper for large consumers and small resources, and models using consumer and resource masses separately outperformed models using consumer:resource mass ratios, suggesting that consumer and resource body mass act independently to set interaction strengths. Lastly, we show that the extent to which foraging is affected by temperature or mass depends on the taxonomic identity of the consumer and the dimensionality of the consumer-resource interaction. We thus argue that although overall body size and temperature effects can be identified, they are not universal, and therefore food web and community modeling approaches could be improved by considering taxonomic identity along with body size and unimodal temperature effects.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000538111800021	31944271

Effect of Temperature on Daily Consumption Rate of the Predatory Thrips, Scolothrips sexmaculatus Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)								EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL				22	1			51	54						2012	2012	Scolothrips sexmaculatus Pergande is a predaceous thrips species on spider mites. Consumption rate is one of the main parameters to evaluate S. sexmaculatus potential as a biological control agent for spider mites. Its daily consumption rate on Tetranychus urticae Koch, at two different temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C) was studied under laboratory conditions. At 30 degrees C, S. sexmaculatus female consumed 56.5 eggs, 36.25 immatures and 19.25 adults/day, while the male predator consumed comparatively fewer numbers of the prey; 40.5, 31.25 and15.25, respectively. Daily consumption rate of the 2nd nymphal instar of S. sexmaculatus was higher than the one. The daily consumption rate of the predator was fewer at 25 degrees C. The present results suggest that S. sexmaculatus can effectively suppress the mite's population.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1110-1768	2536-9342		WOS:000307325500011

Tanytarsus gracilentus population dynamics in Lake Myvatn show a tendency to cycle, with three oscillations occurring between 1977 and 1999 having periods of roughly 7 years. The population abundance fluctuated over four orders of magnitude.2. A partial autocorrelation function (PACF) accounting for measurement error revealed a strong positive lag-1 autocorrelation and a moderate negative lag-2 partial autocorrelation. This suggests that the dynamics can be explained by a simple second-order autoregressive process.3. We tested the alternative hypotheses that the cyclic dynamics of T gracilentus were driven by consumer-resource interactions in which T gracilentus is the consumer, or predator-prey interactions in which T gracilentus is the prey We analysed autoregressive models including both consumer-resource interactions and predator-prey interactions.4. Wing length of T gracilentus was used as a surrogate for resource abundance and/or quality, because body size is known to fluctuate with resource. abundance and quality in dipterans. Furthermore, the wing lengths of Micropsectra lindrothi, a species ecologically similar to T gracilentus, fluctuated synchronously with T gracilentus wing lengths, thereby indicating that the shared resources of these two species were indeed cycling. Wing lengths of other chironomid species were not synchronized.5. The predators of T gracilentus included midges in the genera Procladius and Macropelopia, and the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus (three-spined stickleback).6. The autoregressive models supported the hypothesis that T gracilentus dynamics were driven by consumer-resource interactions, and rejected the hypothesis that the dynamics were driven by predator-prey interactions.7. The models also revealed the consequences of consumer-resource interactions for the magnitude of fluctuations in T gracilentus abundance. Consumer-resource interactions amplified the exogenous variability affecting T gracilentus per capita population growth rates (e.g. temperature, rainfall, etc.), leading to variability in abundance more than two orders of magnitude greater than the exogenous variability.									41	0	0	0	40	0	43			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000178187900012

Among the numerous predators, Anthocoris minki pistaciae Wagner (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) was found as a common species in pistachio orchards of Kerman Province, Iran. The consumption rate index is essential to determine the prey-predator interaction and efficiency for biological control. On the other hand, temperature as an abiotic environmental factor has an important influence on population parameters of insects. Thus, predation rate of A. minki pistaciae feeding on A. pistaciae was evaluated at three different temperatures (17, 26, and 30 +/- 2 degrees C) with a 16L:8D photoperiod and 55 +/- 5% R.H. All of the data were analyzed by the age-stage, two-sex consumption rate, MS Chart software (Ver. 2017.05.28). Obtained results showed that the highest net predation rate (C-0) and the transformation rate from prey population to predator offspring (Q(p)) occurred at 30 degrees C (1309.13 and 54.67 prey nymphs, respectively). Moreover, the highest value for the mean prey consumption of adult insects was (1300.15 psyllid nymphs) and the highest daily mean consumption rate was calculated at this temperature. Thereupon, 30 degrees C is the best temperature for feeding A. minki pistaciae under the laboratory conditions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1110-1768	2536-9342		WOS:000446281000001

Predation occurred in all active stages of B. dolichus. Blattisocius dolichus preferred live R. similis when offered together with Caneorhabditis elegans and dead R. similis in a choice test. Consumption rate was affected by temperature, prey density and duration of starvation. Maximum consumption rates were observed at 25 A degrees C, for both adult males and females after being starved for 96 and 72 h, respectively. Consumption rate increased with increasing prey density until satiation was reached, when the predator-prey ratio was 1:250 for both male and female predators. Anthurium andraeanum seedlings, artificially infested with R. similis (1,000 per pot), were used to evaluate the biological control efficiency of B. dolichus. The nematode density decreased by 66 % 10 days after a release of 500 mites per pot.									9	1	0	0	8	1	11			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000319612000002	23269565

They are the basis for many comprehensive studies in pest management, pesticide resistance, predator-prey relationships, biological control, mass-rearing and harvesting of insects, plant resistance, etc. Because the morphology, physiology, survival, fecundity, and predation/consumption rate of most arthropods will vary significantly depending on their developmental stage and sex, precise description of stage differentiation and inclusion of both sexes are critical for attaining realistic and accurate life table analyses and correctly evaluating the overall fitness of populations. Since traditional female age-specific life tables ignore the male individuals in a population and are incapable of describing the unique and important feature of stage differentiation (i.e., metamorphosis) that is a defining characteristic of insects and mites, their application to data analysis involving these groups will inevitably result in miscalculations and limit the practical application of these life tables. On the other hand, the age-stage, two-sex life table (hereafter referred to as the two-sex life table whenever appropriate), can precisely delineate stage differentiation and includes both sexes in data analysis, description, and interpretation, and in practical applications. In this review, the problems of female age-specific life tables are examined, followed by a discussion of the advantages of using the two-sex life table. Finally, applications of the two-sex life table in various types of entomological research are discussed and accompanied by examples.									10	1	0	0	5	0	11			0171-8177	2363-7102		WOS:000531551400001

Genetic polymorphism seems to be the strategy adopted for facing different habitats at different times. Many modifications, such as body shape, body size, and elytral patterns, may be adaptive through imparting increased tolerance to adverse conditions. Previous studies evaluating differences in the light-colored aulica and dark colored nigra phenotypes found differences in biological performances at 20degreesC. However, whether the predatory activity of the different phenotypes changes under different temperatures remains unknown. Relative consumption rate and predation activity of fourth instars and adults of aulica and nigra phenotypes were compared at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30degreesC. Our results showed that temperature is a limiting factor to larval and adult relative consumption rate. The thermal optimum of nigra adults was 3.7degreesC lower than that of aulica. Both larvae and adults of nigra were more stenothermic than aulica. Close to the upper limit of tolerance (30degreesC), predation activity of nigra adults was more affected than aulica. In larvae body size and shape could explain the differences observed, because aulica is significantly bigger than nigra and thus aulica presumably can better control beat exchange.									46	4	1	0	49	1	55			0046-225X			WOS:000186445200003

Blooms of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Nostocales) are increasingly more common in freshwaters. It can produce neurotoxins (paralytic shellfish poison, PSP), particularly in warm regions of the Americas. The knowledge about the effects of these neurotoxins on the clearance rate of zooplankton from warm regions still lags behind that of other world regions. We compared the toxin profile (using HPLC), morphology and growth rates of two PSP-producing C. raciborskii strains from South America. We evaluated the effect of these two strains on the clearance rate of two medium-sized grazers typical from subtropical and tropical environments, the copepod Notodiaptomus iheringi (similar to 1.1 mm) and the cladoceran Daphnia pulex (similar to 0.8 mm) in 2.5 h experiments. We found differences in the PSP profile, toxicity and morphology of the two C. raciborskii strains. Medium-sized predators were able to remove filaments of both strains in a similar amount despite their morphological and toxin differences. However, cladocera were significantly more affected than copepods in their clearance rates, suggesting differential consequences for their survival and success in warm freshwaters.									6	1	0	0	3	1	8			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000388173000005

The capacity of predatory staphylinid species to feed oil cereal pests was measured, with six species tested in petri dishes, in the laboratory at room temperature. Almost 23% of the Hungarian and 13% of the European staphylinid fauna are represented in the investigated agro-ecosystems. In orchards, 5236 individuals, belonging to 253 species, were collected. The most widely occurring were Omalium caesum Gravenhorst, Drusilla canaliculata (F.), Dinaraea angustula (Gyllenhal), Palporus nitidulus (F.), Xantholinus. longiventris (Olivier), X. linearis (Olivier) and Aleochara bipustulata (L.). In winter wheat, 798 individuals and 20 species were collected, the most frequent were Staphylinus caesareus Cederh, Tachyporus hypnorum (F.), Philonthus cognatus (Stephens), Aloconota gregaria (Erichson), Tachyporus chrysomelinus (L.) and T. obtusus (L.). Species composition differed by crop (apple, pear and wheat), soil composition and surrounding habitat. Species diversity was also influenced by these parameters. In wheat, one acute change in species composition was observed with the decline of Tachyporus spp., which occurred equally across all farms. The consumption rate of prey by the dominant species occurring in wheat ecosystems was relatively high; however, we did not offer any fungal food to compare with insects' prey.									7	1	1	0	10	0	11			0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000259233700003	18279565

The results of laboratory bioassay revealed that prey consumption rate of predator species was positively related with increasing temperature and inversely related with increasing search area. Polynomial logistic regression equations and associated parameters showed that A. sardea exhibited a type II functional response in variable search area and type-III response at variable temperatures.

Stoichiometric relationship between suspension-feeding caddisfly (Trichoptera: Brachycentridae) and seston								HYDROBIOLOGIA				675	1			129	141		10.1007/s10750-011-0811-4				OCT 2011	2011	Organisms must acquire adequate amounts of carbon (C) and nutrients [i.e., nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] from their food to support growth. The growth of organisms can be constrained by consumer-resource elemental imbalances in C:nutrient ratios, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the elemental composition of aquatic organisms can change through ontogeny, which can impose additional challenges to growth (the growth rate hypothesis), terminal body size, and reproductive output. In streams, growth in larval aquatic insects is influenced primarily by food quality and quantity, temperature, and population density. We conducted a field study that tracked the growth of a common suspension-feeding caddisfly (Brachycentrus occidentalis) through its ontogeny by comparing the elemental composition (C:N:P) of the organism with its available food supply (suspended particulate organic matter or seston). Larvae and seston were sampled from four streams throughout 1 year. Differences in the growth of larvae among the streams were evident, even though the streams possessed similar thermal regimes. Spatial and temporal differences in the nutrient contents of B. occidentalis and seston were observed, suggesting a consumer-resource elemental imbalance. Lower C:P and N:P ratios in food were positively correlated to larval growth rate, suggesting growth was limited by P. The C, N, and P contents in B. occidentalis' body tissue did change throughout ontogeny. C:nutrient ratios varied across sites during larval development; however, inter-site variation decreased substantially as the populations approached pupation. Ultimately, consumer-resource elemental imbalances during the larval stage did not lead to differences in pre-emergent standing stocks across sites.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0018-8158			WOS:000293643700013

This study investigated whether larval development rate, metabolism and feeding ecology differ between D. latissimus and the congeneric D. lapponicus to explore factors explaining its decline. During instar I and II, D. latissimus larvae developed faster and gained more weight than D. lapponicus larvae. In accordance, D. latissimus larvae had higher oxygen consumption rates than D. lapponicus larvae, which signifies a greater energy expenditure. Food preference tests showed that D. latissimus larvae strongly prefer caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) with early instars being obligatory dependent on caddisfly larvae for their development. Only instar III larvae readily fed on alternative prey items. In contrast, D. lapponicus larvae had a broader diet and even rejected caddisfly larvae. Based on field observations, availability of caddisfly larvae strongly declined before the end of the larval development of D. latissimus, suggesting that time constraints on food availability limit completion of larval development. Our results suggest that food limitation during (early) larval stages is a possible bottle-neck for this species, potentially explaining its disappearance from former localities. Promoting caddisfly larvae in the vicinity of D. latissimus oviposition sites, may possibly safeguard the present distribution of D. latissimus and support the species recovery. Although more research is needed, promoting leaf litter in shores may be beneficial to the shredding caddisfly larvae and in turn for their predator D. latissimus.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1752-458X	1752-4598		WOS:000449713000005

Developmental time (egg to adult) significantly decreased with increase in the temperature. It lasted 27.5 days at 25 +/- 1 degrees C and 21.3 days at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. The development threshold of R. lophanthae immature stages was 7.823 degrees C, while the thermal constant was 472.379 degree-days. No mortality was recorded during the incubation period. The total mortality rate amongst the larval instars was with 3.33% at 25 +/- 1 degrees C and 6.77% at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. The sex ratio male to female was 1:1.06. The consumption rate significantly increased with increasing temperatures and within the larval instars. The four larval instar consumed 24.3 and 33.5 adults of A. nerii at 25 +/- 1 and 30 +/- 1 degrees C, respectively. Overall, micro-climate temperature had a significant impact on the biological parameters of R. lophanthae.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000489319800006	30616703

Functional response studies are often used to determine the suitability of predators as biocontrol agents. Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are often used for the control of crop pests such as aphids. However, most functional response studies on coccinellids compare a limited number of species at different life stages, temperatures or sexes. A large-scale comparison of ladybird beetle functional responses is needed to evaluate the utility of these species as potential biocontrol predators and to understand the traits that influence the interaction strength between ladybird beetles and their prey.2. We compiled 158 ladybird beetle functional responses from 30 studies and tested for effects of taxa, traits, temperature and arena size on functional response parameters using linear mixed-effects models.3. Our results show that functional response parameters (handling time and space clearance rate) are affected by predator stage, predator mass, prey type, temperature and arena size. Although complicated by interaction terms, space clearance rate generally increased with predator size, temperature and predator stage, while handling time decreased with predator size, temperature and predator stage. Coleopteran prey induced the highest handling times.4. Our results also show that experimental arena size has a large, consistent effect on space clearance rate. Arena size is more important in determining foraging rates at low prey densities than any other factor considered here, including predator mass and temperature. Efforts to use laboratory-based functional response experiments to evaluate the efficacy of biocontrol predators are therefore confounded by the choice of arena size.									18	0	0	0	16	0	17			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000441438600032

Quantifying the temperature dependence of consumer-resource interactions is thus essential for predicting ecological responses to warming. We explored feeding interactions between different predator-prey pairs in controlled-temperature chambers and in a system of naturally heated streams. We found consistent temperature dependence of attack rates across experimental settings, though the magnitude and activation energy of attack rate were specific to each predator, which varied in mobility and foraging mode. We used these parameters along with metabolic rate measurements to estimate energetic efficiency and population abundance with warming. Energetic efficiency accurately estimated field abundance of a mobile predator that struggled to meet its metabolic demands, but was a poor predictor for a sedentary predator that operated well below its energetic limits. Temperature effects on population abundance may thus be strongly dependent on whether organisms are regulated by their own energy intake or interspecific interactions. Given the widespread use of functional response parameters in ecological modelling, reconciling outcomes from laboratory and field studies increases the confidence and precision with which we can predict warming impacts on natural systems.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000481017800001	31283002

We predicted that climate warming and CO 2-enrichment should strengthen trophic cascades by reducing the relative efficiency of predation-resistant herbivores, if herbivore consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. This weakens the insurance effect of herbivore diversity. We tested this prediction using experimental ocean warming and acidification in seagrass mesocosms. Meta-analyses of published experiments first indicated that consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. The experiment then showed that three common herbivores together controlled macroalgae and facilitated seagrass dominance, regardless of climate change. When the predation-vulnerable herbivore was excluded in normal conditions, the two resistant herbivores maintained top-down control. Under warming, however, increased algal growth outstripped control by herbivores and the system became algal-dominated. Consequently, climate change can reduce the relative efficiency of resistant herbivores and weaken the insurance effect of biodiversity.									53	5	0	0	47	0	57			1461-023X			WOS:000305943000012	22676312

Six different prey types were collected from the field and subjected to choice and no choice feeding experiments in the laboratory. Feeding activities.t3f both scorpion species were also recoded directly in the field. Both scorpion species consumed' significantly higher number of flies i.e., Musca domestica (Linnaeus, 1758) than other prey types grasshopper nymphs, grasshopper adults, lycosid spiders, moths and house crickets) during no choice feeding experiment. However, in choice feeding experiment both scorpion species preferfed grasshopper nymphs. Scorpions consumed only soft body parts of the larger sized prey but, consumed the whole body of small sized prey. Prey consumption of both scorpion species increased with temperature. However, consumption rate of studied species was found to be negatively correlated with the humidity level.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0030-9923			WOS:000389011700029

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which differ in body size and feeding method. The consumption rate of each larval stage of both species increased with increasing temperature. The consumption rate for total development (from egg hatch to pupation) of S. levaillanti was found to be 22.9 aphids per day at 30degreesC. It was much higher for C. sanguinea (975.1 aphids per day at 25degreesC and 1066 aphids per day at 30 degreesC). The larger species, C. sanguinea was more voracious at each temperature than the smaller species, S. levaillanti. The larvae of S. levaillanti, employing pre-oral digestion, were more efficient in converting food to body mass than larvae of C. sanguinea, which used chewing and sucking. The fourth instars of both species were less efficient in converting food to body mass than were their first three instars. It was concluded that body size and feeding method of coccinellid predators play an important role in food consumption and efficiency of conversion of food to body mass.									24	1	0	0	26	1	28			1386-6141			WOS:000173564400006

Different larval instars and adult thrips were provided as prey in different combinations (choice) or separately (no-choice). In choice test, no significant difference was observed in total thrips consumption per day. But in both observation hours (12 h or 24 h), a significant difference was observed between the feeding of immature and adult thrips. In a no-choice test, when we confined N. barkeri to feed on a specified diet of T. tabaci (first instar, second instar, or adults separately), a significant difference in total thrips consumption per day was observed in each prey group. In both tests, predatory mites fed more on first larval instar thrips compared to second larval instar and adults. However, consumption rate was rather higher during initial feeding hours (12 h) and slowed down later (24 h); this may be due to aggressive predation initially. The findings suggest that N. barkeri feed more on younger instars of T. tabaci and if these predators are released during early pest outbreak it will control the thrips population.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1021-3589	1026-4914		WOS:000430860500014

Higher mean and peak temperatures, together with parasites, might influence the impact of predatory invasive host species additively, synergistically or antagonistically. Here, we apply the comparative functional response methodology (relationship between resource consumption rate and resource supply) in one experiment and conduct a second scaled-up mesocosm experiment to assess any differential predatory impacts of the freshwater invasive amphipod Gammarus pulex, when uninfected and infected with the acanthocephalan Echinorhynchus truttae, at three temperatures representative of current and future climate. Individual G. pulex showed Type II predatory functional responses. In both experiments, infection was associated with higher maximum feeding rates, which also increased with increasing temperatures. Additionally, infection interacted with higher temperatures to synergistically elevate functional responses and feeding rates. Parasitic infection also generally increased Q(10) values. We thus suggest that the differential metabolic responses of the host and parasite to increasing temperatures drives the synergy between infection and temperature, elevating feeding rates and thus enhancing the ecological impact of the invader.

The gross and daily consumptions of T. molitor larvae with and without defense by the predator Supputius cincticeps, and the gross and daily weight gains of the predator were quantified. Effects of the prey defense and temperature on the food consumption by the 2(nd), 3(rd), 4(th) and 5(th) instar nimphs of S. cincticeps were determined. The research was carried out in the Biological Control Unit of the Embrapa-Centro Nacional de Pesquisa de Algodao, at Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, 60+/-10% RH and 14L:10D photoperiod. The results showed that the gross consumption of T. molitor larvae by S. cincticeps depends on the predator instar and on temperature, on the predator instar and on the prey defense, and on temperature and on the prey defense; the daily consumption of S. cincticeps depends on its instar and on temperature, and on its instar and on the prey defense; and S, cincticeps weight gain depends on its instar, on temperature and on the prey defense. The size of T. molitor larvae works as a defense to attack of S. cincticeps.									9	0	0	0	9	5	10			0100-204X			WOS:000079259700003		
J	Isikber, Ali A.								Comparison of reproductive numerical response of two coccinellid predators, Scymnus levaillanti mulsant and Cycloneda sanguinea L. (Coleoptera : Coccinellidae)								SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST				31	2			135	146						JUN 2006	2006	The reproductive numerical response of Scymnus levaillanti Muls. and Cycloneda sanguinea L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in relation to prey consumption was compared in the laboratory at various temperatures. These two species present different aphidophagous strategies: S. levaillanti is a small tropical species, laying small single egg, while C. sanguinea from cooler climates is a large species laying large eggs in egg batches. There are highly significant positive linear correlations between the number of eggs laid and the number of aphids consumed by both coccinellid species. C. sanguinea required more aphids to start laying the eggs than S.levaillanti. The smaller species, S. levaillanti, began to oviposit at much lower aphid densities than did the larger species, C. sanguinea. At low densities of aphids, therefore, S. levaillanti could be the dominant species due to the lower minimum threshold for egg production and the greater sensitivity of the adults to low aphid populations; whereas, C. sanguinea could be the dominant species at high densities of aphids due to its greater fecundity. The reproductive numerical response of S. levaillanti confined to a narrow range of cotton aphid densities due to its satiation at low aphid densities (80 aphids per 64 cm 2) can account for its poor efficiency as a biological control agent. On the other hand, C. sanguinea required more aphids to be satiated (480 aphids/64 cm(2)) than S. levaillanti, which can provide a better result for control of the aphids.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0147-1724			WOS:000239946900007

Consumption rate was highest (7.2 and 2.2 individuals per day per individual of s. annulatum and S. rusticum, respectively) in prereproductive ages of the waterbugs. This was followed by a gradual decline with the increase in age of the predators. The consumption rate was gradually higher with the increase of temperature from 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The bugs failed to survive beyond 35 days at 35 degrees C. Though the bugs prey upon the snails of all sizes preference for 6.5 x 4.5 mm to 8 x 5 mm individuals by S. annulatum and for 5 x 3 mm to 6.5 x 4.5 mm individuals by S. rusticum is established. The waterbugs, irrespective of species, consumed the snail individuals belonged to 3 x 2 - 4 x 3 mm size group maximum when supplied separately. The rate of predation gradually declined with the rise of predator's density irrespective of waterbug species.Predation rate increased with increasing prey density. This was level off when the prey snails were 1100 and 700 in number for S. annulatum and S. rusticum respectively. An adult S. annulatum and S. rusticum consumed 5.04, 3.7, 1.43 and 3.36, 2.49, 1.04 snails per day respectively in summer, monsoon and winter.									5	0	0	0	6	0	6			0074-0276	1678-8060		WOS:A1994NW66100003	7823805

Benthic invertebrate densities were similar across seasons and did not differ between tributaries and the mainstem. Fluctuations in diet followed seasonal changes in invertebrate sizes and abundances. Average prey biomass consumed was positively correlated with fish size. Consumption rates were high in spring and summer but fell significantly in fall when fewer and smaller prey were eaten. A switch in consumption from 36% terrestrial prey biomass in spring to 85% in summer coincided with an increase in terrestrial prey size and a decrease in benthic prey size. Location within the watershed also affected prey consumption. Despite similarities in diet composition, tributary trout consumed somewhat more biomass than trout in the mainstem but grew relatively slower. Because stream fishes such as Oncorhynchus trout feed opportunistically on varied prey, studies incorporating multiple seasons and stream types are important to understanding energy exchanges between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000386674900004

We documented the thermal limits of larvae of three amphibian species native to Hong Kong, and their introduced, invasive predator, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0-21.6 degrees C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions. This could mean a reduction in their capacity to deal with other stressors such as pollution and predators, and that G. affinis may have an advantage over native amphibians.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000466820900020	30975413

In this study we focused on evaluating trophic interactions during the juvenile period ofOncorhynchus mykiss, and the ecologically similar nativePercichthys trucha. For this purpose, we evaluated the diet and size range of juveniles of both species in the Caleufu River over one yearly cycle. The functional response (FR: the relationship between prey density and consumption rate) and functional response ratio (FRR = attack rate/handling time) were estimated for each species, in mono-specific and multi-specific trials. Comparison of the diet of these species by season showed high similarity for spring and summer. It was also found that juvenile sizes of these species overlap during early ontogeny. Additionally, both species presented a type II FR in mono-specific trials, with similar functional curves. In multi-specific experimentsO. mykissjuveniles were dominant, leading to a reduction inP. truchafood intake. FRR was higher forO. mykissthan forP. truchain mono-specific experiments, a difference which increased in multi-specific experiments, indicating the high potential ecological impact ofO. mykiss. Our results show it is very likely thatO. mykissand nativeP. truchacompete in lotic environments,O. mykissbeing competitively superior, highlighting the potential detrimental effect they may have during the juvenile period, especially in habitats and seasons where food resources are scarce.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000556223400002

Experiments were carried out in petri dishes at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% r. h. and 16L:8D photoperiod in a controlled temperature room. All tested stages exhibited a Type II response determined by a logistic regression model. The attack rate (alpha) and handling time (T(h)) coefficients of a Type II response were estimated by fitting a "random-predator" equation to the data. Although the estimates of alpha for all stages of A. fasciatopunctata revelierei tested were similar, the longest T(h) was obtained for 3rd instar larva because of the lower consumption rate at densities above 40 prey/day. Results indicated that the adult female has the highest predation of C. juglandis followed by 4th instar larvae, adult males and 3rd instar larvae. However, further field-based studies are needed to draw firm conclusions.									20	3	0	0	26	0	31			0334-2123			WOS:000276123900004

At 7 degrees C only 33% of the mites walked and these individuals all walked less than 1.5 cm min(-1). All mites walked at 9 degrees C and at 12 degrees C all were highly active, walking more than 1.5 cm min(-1). Daily food consumption rates of adult female B. tarsalis offered young eggs of Ephestia kuehniella as food were investigated at temperatures of 9-27 degrees C. Food consumption below 13 degrees C was very low. At temperatures of 13-19 degrees C the mean number of fully ingested eggs had a level of between 0.5 and 1.0 egg in 24 h. At temperatures of 21-27 degrees C the mean number of fully ingested eggs was above 1.0 egg in 24 h. The mean number of destroyed eggs per female at temperatures above 13 degrees C ranged from three to five eggs per day.

In the context of biological invasions, determining if and how the individual-level impacts of invasive predators relates to their impacts in multiple-individual situations will inform understanding of how such impacts might propagate through recipient communities.Here, we use functional responses (the relationship between prey consumption rate and prey density) to compare the impacts of the invasive freshwater mysid crustacean Hemimysis anomala with a native counterpart Mysis salemaai when feeding on basal cladoceran prey (i) as individuals, (ii) in conspecific groups and (iii) in conspecific groups in the presence of a higher fish predator, Gasterosteus aculeatus.In the absence of the higher predator, the invader consumed significantly more basal prey than the native, and consumption was additive for both mysid species - that is, group consumption was predictable from individual-level consumption.Invaders and natives were themselves equally susceptible to predation when feeding with the higher fish predator, but an MPE occurred only between the natives and higher predator, where consumption of basal prey was significantly reduced. In contrast, consumption by the invaders and higher predator remained additive.The presence of a higher predator serves to exacerbate the existing difference in individual-level consumption between invasive and native mysids. We attribute the mechanism responsible for the MPE associated with the native to a trait-mediated indirect interaction, and further suggest that the relative indifference to predator threat on the part of the invader contributes to its success and impacts within invaded communities.									63	0	0	0	60	0	63			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000334289500017	24117414

Groups of different life stages of the prey were offered (eggs, larvae, nymphs and adults). The prey preference varied with the stage of S. punctillum. First larval instars had no significant preference among the T urticae stages offered. Second larval instars consumed significantly more spider mite larvae in comparison with nymphs. In contrast, third larval instars indicated a strong preference for mite eggs. Significantly fewer T urticae larvae were consumed by the fourth larval instars of S. punctillum, in comparison with the three other mite stages. Finally, adult predators consumed significantly more mite eggs than the other stages offered. This preferential trend was similar for all adults tested, whether during the pre-oviposition or the oviposition period.									14	1	0	0	17	0	21			0334-2123	1876-7184		WOS:000220311000008

They also produce more eggs at a faster rate. As we wanted to know how these traits influence population dynamics, we have determined the population growth parameters for the aphidophagous Scymnus nubilus Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and the coccidophagous Nephus reunioni Fursch (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) fed Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea) and Planococccus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Coccoidea) respectively under controlled laboratory conditions. Net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of natural increase, and finite rate of increase were all significantly higher, and generation time and doubling time were both significantly shorter in S. nubilus compared to N. reunioni. The reproductive output of the aphidophagous species rapidly reaches a peak and then sharply declines while it is regularly distributed throughout adult life in the coccidophagous predator. A significant difference in late survival was found, with S. nubilus exhibiting higher survival. Adaptation to the consumption of aphids and coccids occurred in several species during the co-evolutionary history of ladybird beetles and their prey. Thus, comparing other species would be valuable to confirm the differences reported here.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000319347000007

Covariance between predation risk and nutritional preferences confounds interpretations of giving-up density experiments								ECOLOGY				99	7			1517	1522		10.1002/ecy.2365				JUL 2018	2018	Giving-up density (GUD) experiments have been a foundational method to evaluate perceived predation risk, but rely on the assumption that food preferences are absolute, so that areas with higher GUDs can be interpreted as having higher risk. However, nutritional preferences are context dependent and can change with risk. We used spiders and grasshoppers to test the hypothesis that covariance in nutritional preferences and risk may confound the interpretation of GUD experiments. We presented grasshoppers with carbohydrate-rich and protein-rich diets, in the presence and absence of spider predators. Predators reduced grasshopper preference for the protein-rich food, but increased their preference for the carbohydrate-rich food. We then measured GUDs with both food types under different levels of risk (spider density, 0-5). As expected, GUDs increased with spider density indicating increasing risk, but only when using protein-rich food. With carbohydrate-rich food, GUD was independent of predation risk. Our results demonstrate that predation risk and nutritional preferences covary and can confound interpretation of GUD experiments.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000436869900001	29697137

We measured HIF in house wren chicks (Troglodytes aedon) ranging in mass from 1.6 to 10.3 g. This mass range (age 2-10 days) spanned a transition from blind, naked, ectothermic chicks through alert, endothermic birds with nearly complete feathering. We fed chicks crickets (2.7-10% of chick body mass) and determined HIF from continuous measurements of oxygen consumption rate (VO2) before and after meals. At warm ambient temperatures (T-a) of 33-36 degrees C, the magnitude of HIF (in mi O-2 or joules) was linearly related to meal mass and was not affected by chick mass. HIF accounted for 6.3% of ingested energy, which is within the range of results for other carnivorous vertebrates. The duration of HIF was inversely related to chick mass; 10-g chicks processed a standard meal approximately twice as fast as 2-g chicks. HIF duration increased with increasing meal mass. The peak VO2 during HIF, expressed as the factorial increase above resting metabolism, was independent of body mass and meal mass. In large, endothermic chicks ( > 8 g), HIF substituted for thermoregulatory heat production at low T-a.									56	0	0	0	54	0	56			0174-1578			WOS:A1997XB70600010

Exposure from hatch to short daylengths induced 4th instar diapause in over 50% of wild T. rutilus from southern Florida. Short daylengths and lower temperatures significantly reduced prey consumption rates. At a low frequency, diapausing larvae killed prey without consuming, which behavior increased with time in the 4th instar and was distinct from killing by prepupae. Termination of diapause by transfer of 4th instars to long daylengths was accompanied by an increase in prey consumption rate prior to pupation. Mean pupal masses were significantly affected by photoperiod and temperature treatments, confirming a correlation between heavier pupae and colder temperatures in the field. At 25 degrees C and 21 degrees C, female pupae were significantly larger than males, in contrast to no sexual size difference observed for continuous development at 27 degrees C. The composite index of performance (r'), an analog of the the per capita rate of increase, for diapausing cohorts was one-half to two-thirds of that estimated for non-diapausing cohorts, but temperature alone did not affect r' between 25 and 21 degrees C. Low rates of prey consumption during winter diapause may contribute to the relatively modest, albeit significant, effect of T. rutilus predation on mosquito abundance as estimated from long-term censuses of treeholes.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000074002600009

Mean percentage contribution to the gut content varied significantly between the food categories and between different-sized specimens for all species. Detritus was the major item in guts of juveniles of all species, contributing 70-100% in entire mass of gut content. Contribution of this food category in guts of adults significantly decreased where proportion of animal food significantly increased. Distinct size-dependent differentiation in food preferences was found for P robustoides, whereby juveniles are preferably detritivorous, mid-sized specimens choose macrophytes as a favorite food and large specimens are predators. The relationship between consumption rates (C-R, %) and wet weight of consumer body was approximated by exponential function. During predation, the diurnal consumption rate of all species ranged between 6 and 63% of body weight, being the lowest (5-22%) for the large species G. loricatus. The amount of consumed matter essentially increased when macrophytes (C-R = 14-84%) or detritus (C-R = 46-103%) were offered as food items. The predation index, the difference between losses in number of prey due to predation and the physiological requirements of a predator (G. loricatus case study), increased with an increasing density of prey and reached at maximum 50 %. Significant decreases in daily consumption rates of G. loricatus preying upon oligochaetes, chironomids and small amphipods were obtained at a decrease in prey availability. These results indicate high variability of consumption rates in the amphipods related to type, availability and amount of food.

Here, we examine how predator and prey body size affects the functional response of a generalist predator-damselfly nymphs-feeding on three prey types: copepods, Daphnia, and Chydorus. Our results suggest that consumption of copepods is independent of predator body size, while increased predator body size is associated with an increased space clearance rate for Daphnia and a reduced space clearance rate for Chydorus. When considered together, foraging rates on Daphnia and Chydorus (both cladocerans) are consistent with a hump-shaped functional response, with peak foraging rates occurring at an intermediate predator-prey size ratio. Thus, although most food web theory assumes allometric predator-prey links or peaked functional responses at intermediate predator-prey size ratios, our results suggest that both relationships may occur in food webs, in addition to size-independent functional responses.									12	0	0	0	11	0	11			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000413691100002	28936547

Environmentally friendly methods to control this olive pest involve the identification of its natural enemies. This study evaluated the role of Ocypus olens (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) in the predation of B. oleae pupae, by means of molecular gut content analysis. Modified dry pitfall traps were used to collect live specimens from low-input olive orchards in Tuscany (Italy). Sampling was fine-tuned with a degree-day model estimating the presence of pest pupae in the soil. PCR analyses carried out on field-collected specimens demonstrated that O. olens is a predator of B. oleae, at least during autumn. These results are consistent with predictions of the degree-day model. Knowledge on species composition, traits and complementarity of the natural enemies of B. oleae pupae needs further investigation to advance conservation biological control strategies.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000427474800006

Here, we assessed the interacting effect of conspecific and higher-order predation risk on the per capita consumption and behaviours of the invasive freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex, using field microcosm and video-recorded lab experiments in Northern Ireland. Gammarus pulex exhibited higher per capita consumption in the presence of conspecifics, owing to reduced handling time of prey, regardless of fish presence and despite reduced swimming time and increased time spent physically interacting with each other. Consumption was lower in the presence of fish in the field, and handling time decreased with greater amphipod densities in the presence of fish cue in the lab. Our results show that impacts of G. pulex are independently influenced by conspecifics and predation risk, whereas handling time revealed an interacting effect of conspecific density and predation risk. Further assessments of the responses of invasive animals to biotic interactions could help explain variability in their impacts at local spatial scales.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000419137900013

We compared the development, reproduction, locomotion, and predation ability of the predatory ladybird Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) under various photoperiods, light intensities, and light wavelengths. The results indicated long daylight, high light intensity, and particular colors light (blue, green, and yellow) could benefit H. variegata especially in shortening the period of immature development, increasing mating frequency (shorter mating and pre-oviposition periods), higher fecundity, and a higher proportion of eggs hatched. Average locomotion speed and prey consumption rate of H. variegata increased with prolonged day length and increased light intensity. However, very high intensity of light could inhibit predation rates. Furthermore, green and yellow wavelength conditions increased locomotion speed of H. variegata, and the number of prey consumed increased with increased wavelength. The present study not only revealed significant influences of light conditions on the development and fertility of H. variegata, it also provided sufficient empirical data to improve the efficiency of mass rearing and field releases of this predatory ladybird by regulation of light conditions during biological control applications.									3	1	0	0	4	0	4			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000340575300003

(Acari: Tetranychidae) and B. tabaci, and (2) development, consumption and life table parameters of A. orientalis when reared on T. cinnabarinus, B. tabaci or a mix of both prey species. When preying on different stages of T. cinnabarinus, A. orientalis preferred protonymphs, whereas when preying on different stages of B. tabaci, A. orientalis preferred eggs. When these two most preferred stages were provided together (T. cinnabarinus protonymphs and B. tabaci eggs), A. orientalis randomly selected its prey. Amblyseius orientalis was able to complete its life cycle on B. tabaci eggs, T. cinnabarinus protonymphs, or a mix of both prey. However, its developmental duration was 53.9% and 30.0% longer when reared on B. tabaci eggs than on T. cinnabarinus and a mix of both prey, respectively. In addition, it produced only a few eggs and its intrinsic rate of increase was negative when reared on B. tabaci eggs, which indicates that B. tabaci is not sufficient to maintain A. orientalis population. The intrinsic rates of increase were 0.16 and 0.23 when A. orientalis was fed on the prey mix and T. cinnabarinus, respectively. These results suggest that although B. tabaci is a poor food resource for A. orientalis in comparison to T. cinnabarinus, A. orientalis is able to sustain its population on a mix of both prey. This predatory mite may thus be a potential biological control agent of B. tabaci when this pest co-occurs with the alternative minor pest T. cinnabarinus.									103	1	0	0	71	0	103			1932-6203			WOS:000362499200008	26436422

An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25A degrees C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000426783400011

Using 12 km transects, doliolid blooms were encountered at a horizontal scale of about 2-3 km, which corresponds to submesoscale physical events. Doliolids were also consistently encountered in the subsurface layer above the pycnocline in warmer (> 14 degrees C) and higher-salinity (> 34) water masses, and seawater density was the most critical factor affecting distribution depth. Compared to previous studies, the density and biomass of the blooms observed in this study (77 mgC m(-3) and 4600 inds m(-3)) were highest in the open ocean. Bloom formation consisted of two phases; first, the seeding population of a nurse stage increased rapidly to 2000 inds m(-3) by asexual reproduction, followed by asexual production of phorozooids. Estimated population clearance rates revealed that these dense patches could potentially sweep the surrounding water within 2-3 d. The incidence of exhausted and shrunken zooids was significantly correlated with patch density, suggesting that mortality was due to overgrazing. Shrunken doliolids appeared to sink below the pycnocline, corresponding to 8-17% of the particulate organic carbon flux at 150 m. Hydromedusae, pelagic polycheates, and sapphirinid copepods preyed on the doliolids. These results indicate that doliolids, which were seeded by populations originating from the Kuroshio, formed dense blooms in response to submesoscale physical events and would alter the sinking particle properties (i.e., biological pump) and the epipelagic food web structure through their grazing and mortality.									10	0	0	0	10	0	11			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000362227500021

Suitability of Microtheca ochroloma (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) for the Development of the Predator Chrysoperla rufilabris (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				44	4			1220	1229		10.1093/ee/nvv084				AUG 2015	2015	Microtheca ochroloma Stal, the yellowmargined leaf beetle, is one of the most destructive pests of crucifer vegetables on organic farms. Larvae of the green lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris Burmeister have been observed preying on M. ochroloma, but no studies have evaluated the suitability of M. ochroloma as prey for C. rufilabris or the efficacy of this predator as a biological control agent of the pest. This study quantified the killing rate, developmental time, and survivorship of C. rufilabris when offered eggs and larvae of M. ochroloma at 10, 15, 20, or 25 degrees C. Mean number of prey killed daily increased from 8.4 eggs and 4.0 larvae at 15 degrees C to 18.6 eggs and 10.2 larvae at 25 degrees C. However, predator larvae killed 78% fewer total eggs at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C; total number of first-instar prey killed did not vary significantly with temperature. Mean developmental time of predator larvae decreased from 75.5 d at 15 degrees C to 26.6 d at 25 degrees C when they were fed eggs, whereas it decreased from 54.0 d at 15 degrees C to 21.4 d at 25 degrees C when they were fed larvae. Predator survivorship was reduced by 80% at 15 degrees C and no larvae survived at 10 degrees C. We conclude that C. rufilabris can complete development on a diet of eggs of M. ochroloma, but its effectiveness to control M. ochroloma populations will be lessened during cool months, from November to April, when crucifers are produced in Florida and the beetle is actively developing, reproducing, and causing crop damage.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000359668100032	26314068

Potential cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, population suppression by arthropod predators in upland cotton								INSECT SCIENCE				20	6			778	788		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2012.01583.x				DEC 2013	2013	The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, predation rate of convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, was determined by assigning a single predator randomly to each of four prey density treatments in the laboratory. Prey densities included 25, 50, 100, and 200 aphids per Petri dish arena. Predation response was recorded at 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48h after assigning predators to their prey treatments. Rate of consumption increased through time, with all 25 aphids consumed during the first 4h of the experiment. At the highest density, adult lady beetle consumed on average 49, 99, 131, 163, 183, and 200 aphids within 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Predators showed a curvilinear feeding response in relation to total available time, indicating that convergent lady beetles have the potential to suppress larger populations of aphids through continuous feeding by regulating their predation efficiency during feeding. The analysis of age-specific mortality in absence of prey revealed that lady beetles could survive for an extended period of time (more than 2 weeks) without prey. The ability of a predator to survive without prey delays or prevents the rebound of pest populations that is a significant factor in natural biological control. A two-year field sampling of 10 cotton arthropod predator species showed that spiders (27%) were the most dominant foliage dwelling predators in the Texas High Plains cotton followed by convergent lady beetles (23.5%), hooded beetles (13.5%), minute pirate bugs (11%), green lacewings (9.5%), bigeyed bugs (7.5%), scymnus beetles (3%), soft-winged flower beetles (2%), damsel bugs (1.5%), and assassin bugs (1.5%). A field cage study showed that one H. convergens adult per plant released at prey density of one aphid per leaf kept the aphid population below economic threshold for the entire growing season.									17	4	0	0	15	0	21			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000326972500011	23956125

Following 72 hr starvation, P. cingulatus and H. radiatus larvae became satiated (refused prey offered directly to the mouthparts) after consuming 8-11 and 9-13 mayfly nymphs (Baetis rhodani, 3.5-4.6 mm) respectively. Hunger level affected prey consumption. In P. cingulatus, the number of prey consumed over 24 h (at 9.5-12-degrees-C) increased with starvation periods from 0-72 h, but declined following longer starvation periods.Six clearly recognisable gut states (defined by the position of food material in various parts of the gut) can be identified at different times since commencement of a meal. As environmental temperature increased (from 8-12-degrees-C to 15-17-degrees-C), the rate of change of the gut state increased and the food retention time decreased in all species. Feeding periodicity (i.e. nocturnal/diurnal activity) in the field was estimated based on the evacuation rate and the gut state and environmental temperature at the known time of collection. Initiation of consumption of prey appeared to coincide with emptying of the foregut and proximal midgut, whereas actual feeding continued until complete satiation when some threshold' fullness of the foregut had been reached. The length of time food was held in the foregut was positively correlated with increasing specialisation of the foregut (particularly elaboration of the proventriculus).									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158			WOS:A1994PD06800006

Two of the major allelochemicals in tomato were used: chlorogenic acid and tomatine. Predator performance was negatively affected by both chlorogenic acid-fed and tomatine fed-prey, and there were allelochemical by thermal regime interactions for both. Relative consumption rate and growth rate decreased at the higher levels of tomatine at the warmer thermal regime (summer conditions) but were unaffected at the cooler thermal regime (spring conditions). At the cooler thermal regime, stadium duration was prolonged when the predators were given chlorogenic acid-fed prey, but at the warmer thermal regime there was no such effect. There were several effects of gender: biomass gained, food consumed, relative growth rate and efficiency of conversion of ingested food to biomass were higher for females than males. Furthermore, the effects of thermal regime and tomatine on food consumption and biomass gained differed for females and males. In general, the hypothesis that generalist insect predators may be a selective pressure shaping host plant range of insect herbivores was supported by these results. But the occurrence of allelochemical by thermal regime interactions means that it will be difficult to determine the relative importance of plant chemistry versus predators on patterns of feeding specialization by herbivores without taking into account a third factor, temperature.									21	1	0	0	19	3	22			0029-8549			WOS:A1997WE99300011	28307178

In this paper, we suggest that a genotype that confers a specific pattern of elytra could also confer other specific autecological attributes. The aim of this paper is to compare fitness parameters of two phenotypes (aulica and nigra). Aulica is a common morph characterized by two light red areas that nearly cover the whole elytra, leaving a narrow black border, whereas nigra is completely black; the latter is a rare morph that was naturally obtained from mass cultures. Intraspecific differences occur between H. axyridis phenotypes. The aulica phenotype is more voracious than nigra. Consumption rate of males is higher in aulica than in nigra, but there is no difference for females. Larval biomass of aulica is generally higher than that of nigra. The maximum body-weights reached by larval instars and adults are significantly higher for aulica. Aulica also has greater longevity and reproductive capacity. Only life stage duration of eggs and pre-pupae differ between the two phenotypes. Nigra shows lower fecundity and fertility. Our study showed that the strong differences in phenotype traits of the coccinellid H. axyridis could affect its fitness.									45	2	1	0	46	1	51			1210-5759			WOS:000172455400005

In this paper, the daily prey consumption rate of the immature stages and adult females until 20 days after eclosion of three predators, Stethorus japonicus (lady bug), Scolothrips takahashii (predatory thrips) and Amblyseius californicus (predatory mite), on eggs of Tetranychus urticae (red form) was determined, as well as the functional response of adult females to T. urticae eggs, on lima bean leaf discs in the laboratory at three constant temperatures (18-20,25 and 30 degreesC) and 16L: 8D. Female and male immatures of S. japonicus consumed the same number of spider-mite eggs, whereas more eggs were eaten by female immatures of S. takahashii and A. californicus than by male immatures at each of the temperatures tested. The total number of eggs consumed during the immature stages did not differ significantly among temperatures for any of the three predators. Consumption of T. urticae eggs by S. japonicus was fastest, followed by S. takahashii. Average daily consumption rates of adult females during the first 20 days after emergence at 25 degreesC were 13.4 eggs for A. californicus, 23.0 eggs for S. takahashii and 294.4 eggs for S. japonicus. Adult females of the three predator species showed a type II functional response to prey density, regardless of the temperatures tested.									65	5	0	0	77	4	85			0003-6862	1347-605X		WOS:000220759500011

Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are often linked by resource fluxes and riparian vegetation is commonly affected by anthropogenic alterations to land use or river hydrological regime. I investigated whether shrubs at the freshwater-terrestrial interface alter the supply, distribution and importance of aquatic prey resources to terrestrial consumers. Shrubs were predicted to alter the larval community composition of aquatic insects and the emergence of winged adults, thus affecting aquatic prey subsidies to terrestrial consumers. In addition, shrubs were hypothesized to alter the microclimatic suitability of the riparian zone for adult aquatic insects, act as a physical barrier to their dispersal and affect terrestrial community composition, particularly the abundance and type of predators that could benefit from the aquatic prey resource. Stable isotope dietary analyses and a survey of shrub-dominated and open grassland riparian habitats revealed that larval densities of aquatic insects (EPTM: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Megaloptera) were higher in shrub than grassland habitats; however, reduced emergence and lateral dispersal in shrub areas led to lower densities of adults. The temperature and relative humidity of the riparian zone did not differ between the habitats. Ground-active terrestrial invertebrate communities had a higher proportion of cursorial spiders in grassland, coinciding with greater abundances of aquatic prey. Aquatic prey contribution to cursorial spider diet matched adult aquatic insect abundances. Overall, riparian shrubs reduced the magnitude, or at least altered the timing, of cross-ecosystem subsidy supply, distribution and use by consumers through mechanisms operating in both the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, the structure of ecosystem boundaries has complex effects on the strength of biological interactions between adjacent systems.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1442-9985	1442-9993		WOS:000345204300007

The coccinellids fed on the tobacco aphid, Myzus persicae nicotianae Blackman. Egg, larval and pupal mortality was highest at 14 degrees C reaching 85.0, 73.8 and 29.4% in H. convergens and 49.3, 75.4 and 58.8% in C. septempunctata, respectively. Total preimaginal development ranged from 57.2 to 70.4 days at 14 degrees C, and to 16.9 and 22.1 days at 23 degrees C in H. convergens and C. septempunctata, respectively. Heavier and larger adults of H. convergens were obtained at 17 and 20 degrees C. In C. septempunctata temperature did not affect adult weight while the lowest size was observed at 14 and 17 degrees C. Day-degrees requirements for preimaginal development in H. corvengens were 212.9 above a developmental threshold of 11.0 degrees C. The corresponding values for C. septempunctata were 281.5 and 10.7 degrees C. In H. convergens total and daily aphid consumption ranged from 46.8 aphids at 14 degrees C to 85.0 aphids at 23 degrees C and from 1.5 aphids at 14 degrees C to 9.2 aphids at 23 degrees C, respectively. The corresponding values for C. septempunctata were 112.0 and 2.7 at 14 degrees C and 157.7 and 12.4 at 23 degrees C. The results show the high potential of both predators as biological control agents against the tobacco aphid. The knowledge obtained could be essential for their appropriate use and for the improvement of mass rearing systems.									28	2	0	0	28	2	34			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000230899900002

Although the consequences of variation in temperature for the development and reproduction of insects are generally appreciated, the consequences of potential interactions between temperature and prey for predatory insects are not. Thermal requirements and predation rates were determined for T. notata at different constant temperatures with both prey species. T. notata larvae developed to adults in experimental conditions > 18 to <38 degrees C. The upper thermal limit for egg hatch was 34 degrees C and for pupation was 33 degrees C. Adults reared at >= 32 degrees C did not lay eggs and survived less than 1 week. Prey species did not affect lower temperature thresholds or thermal constants for development from egg to adult. Furthermore, prey did not affect a number of reproductive traits, but the interaction between temperature and prey affected changes in developmental times and oviposition rate with age. Predation rate of T. notata increased as a function of temperature, and T. notata adults generally consumed more nymphs of P. citri than F. dasyrilii. These findings indicate that T. notata is well adapted to the tropical and sub-tropical temperatures and may prove useful for the biological control of some native and non-native mealybugs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1758	2052-174X		WOS:000507852900001

Exploit predatory species efficiently in any biological control program requires an in-depth understanding of predator and prey interactions. The present study was conducted aiming to explore and compare the predatory potential of these predatory species against the wheat aphid, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) along with their relative fitness at different temperatures in terms of duration of lifecycle stages under laboratory conditions. The shortest egg and pupal durations were observed at 33 degrees C, followed by 27 and 23 degrees C. Females of both species had longer life span (20.4 and 22.4days) compared to the respective males (17.2 and 16.2days). The pupal stage for I. scutellaris was significantly shorter than for E. balteatus at different temperatures; but statistically insignificant differences were found for any other life stage. The larvae of I. scutellaris consumed significantly more aphids (438.16) than E. balteatus (398.37) during their larval life span, and this difference was significant during the 1st and 3rd instars. However, the average daily prey intake of both species was found similar until the 10th day after hatching, and thereafter, I. scutellaris consumed significantly higher numbers of aphids/day. Obtained results may offer a baseline data for future conservation studies on biological control of aphids.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1110-1768	2536-9342		WOS:000455813200001

In the present study, we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations on body size, predation capacity and oviposition rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) when presented with eggs of their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). For both predators, mean daily temperature as well as temperature alternation had a substantial impact on the number of prey consumed. At lower average temperatures, more eggs were killed under an alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C and 25 A degrees C/10 A degrees C) than at the corresponding mean constant temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C). At higher average temperatures (> 25 A degrees C), however, the opposite was observed with higher numbers of prey killed at constant temperatures than at alternating temperatures. At 25 A degrees C, temperature variation had no effect on the predation capacity. A similar trend as for the predation rates was observed for the oviposition rates of the phytoseiids. Body size of N. californicus was affected both by average daily temperature and temperature variation, with smaller adult females emerging at alternating temperatures than at constant temperatures, whereas for P. persimilis, temperature variation had no impact on its body size. Our results demonstrate that temperature variations are likely to affect biological control of T. urticae by the studied phytoseiid predators.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000360999800002

Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, 'fright' bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28 degrees C, and 'high' climate warming, 34 degrees C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34 degrees C (Q(10)=7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9 +/- 27.8% and 27.8 +/- 16.5% (means +/- s.e.m.) at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive. Together these findings suggest decrements in fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures stem from increased oxygen demand coupled with a reduced capacity for metabolic depression.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000412240500025	28978640

Populations are structured according to size or stage. Growth, energy allocation and stage transitions are affected by environmental conditions of which temperature, photoperiod, water depth and food supply were taken into account. The resulting modelling framework was applied to describe, analyse and predict alterations in populations with continuous development, populations with distinct state structures and interacting populations. Our exemplary applications consider populations of freshwater Amphipoda, Isopoda and Odonata. The model was capable of simulating life cycle alterations in dependence on temperature in interaction with other environmental factors: (1) population dynamics, (2) seasonal regulation, (3) water depth-dependent dispersal, (4) intraguild predation and (5) consumer-resource dynamics.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000310586900019

Here, I review three topics as ecological bases for the biological control of aphids in a protected culture: the preliminary evaluation of biological control agents, natural enemy release strategies, and the effects of intraguild predation (IGP) on biological control. A comparison of several parasitoid species was conducted to select agents for the biological control of aphids; the intrinsic rate of natural increase was a useful criterion in the preliminary evaluation. To compare predators as biological control agents, the aphid-killing rate must be considered as a critical criterion, rather than reproductive criteria. The banker plant system (open rearing system) is used as a release method for Aphidius colemani and other natural enemies of aphids. Continuous release of parasitoid adults, which is the important characteristic of this method, has a stabilizing effect on population fluctuation in the aphid-parasitoid system. Two species of natural enemies can be used to control aphids in greenhouses. When one parasitoid and one predator are used simultaneously in a greenhouse, IGP of the parasitoid by the predator can occur, but the effect of IGP is less important in greenhouses than in the field.

Although regeneration has obvious survival and fitness benefits, it has also been demonstrated to impose costs on development, reproduction, and behavior. To investigate consequences of regeneration on foraging behavior, Coccinella undecimpunctata L. and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) larvae were treated to remove one limb, allowed to pupate and regenerate and then prey searching ability assessed. Different densities of adults were placed in Petri dishes with aphid prey and consumption assessed over a 24-h period. Amputation/regeneration, predator species, and predator density significantly affected the total number of aphids consumed. Aphid consumption rates and predation efficiency of both regenerated and control beetles significantly increased as predator density increased. Although there were significant differences in consumption between ablated/regenerated and control C. undecimpunctata at each predator densities, H. variegata did not. Further, mutual interference was significantly higher for regenerated compared with control C. undecimpunctata but not so for H. variegata. This is the first demonstration of an effect of ablation/regeneration on foraging behavior of C. undecimpunctata and suggests that H. variegata demonstrates an adaptive phenotypic response to limb regeneration. Coccinellids are widely used as biological agents and these findings concerning the impact of variation in predator density have clear implications for the management of predatorprey ratios in order to maximize efficiency of pest consumption.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000462629400010	30668738

In this respect, we performed a laboratory experiment to show the influence of rising temperature on the consumption of Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a serious aphid pest, by three common lady beetle species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We used climate chambers, representing current temperature and two forecasted warming scenarios of 3 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Larval Adalia bipunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and adult A. bipunctata and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) consumed significantly more aphid biomass at rising temperature. Larvae and adults of all species tested consumed significantly more aphid biomass per body weight, and larval body weight gain of all species was significantly higher at rising temperature. The higher consumption of aphid biomass is likely due to a higher demand for energy of adults, and faster growth of larvae.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000467647400008

While the adults were in flight throughout the year in the natural environment, reproductive activity was strictly seasonal confining to the cooler part of the year November-February, thus with a possibility for 3-4 broods yearly. The adult's sexual diapause was related to temperature control. The larvae passed through five instars, and most food consumption and weight gain occurred in the final instar. Among the three nutritional indices, the values of AD (Approximate digestibility) decreased progressively across the instars, from 90% to 60%. Those of ECD (Efficiency of conversion of digested food) and ECI (Efficiency of conversion of ingested food) increased as the larvae aged, from 5.66% to 51.37%, 5.17% to 31.13% respectively. These data provide an insight into the success of this butterfly species utilizing Capparis spinosa as the larval host and several nectar hosts particularly Vernonia cinerea.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0250-541X			WOS:000256244600010

These concerns have led to efforts to remove nonnative Brown and Rainbow Trout, which are abundant in tributaries of the Colorado River, to enhance native fish communities. We sampled fish, benthic, and drifting macroinvertebrates in November 2010, January 2011, June 2011, and September 2011 to assess resource availability and to evaluate the effects of nonnative Brown and Rainbow Trout in a tributary of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. We evaluated trout diets from stomach samples collected during macroinvertebrate sampling periods, and we estimated annual consumption with bioenergetics models. We used C-13 and N-15 stable isotopes to examine potential diet overlap between native and nonnative fishes. Contributions to benthic biomass varied among megalopterans (16-35%), trichopterans (19-28%), and ephemeropterans (9-32%), whereas ephemeropterans dominated biomass (44-64%) in drift samples. Ephemeropterans were dominant in diets of small (<150 mm total length [TL]) trout, whereas Corydalus and native fish dominated diets of large (>150 mm TL) Brown Trout, and Corydalus and algae dominated diets of large Rainbow Trout. Annual resource consumption was 6x higher for large trout than small trout. Stable isotopes suggested diet overlap between native and nonnative fishes. Large nonnative trout occupied the highest trophic positions. Our results suggest that suppression of nonnative trout may have a positive effect on native fishes via reduced predation and resource competition.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			2161-9549	2161-9565		WOS:000340580700017

They also have been shown to attack pest thrips. It is unknown, however, whether phytoseiid mites can reduce high densities of Thrips flavidulus (Bagnall). We addressed this question by the study of functional and numerical responses. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential predation success of the adults of three predatory mites, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans), Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes), and Euseius nicholsi (Ehara & Lee), against the first-instar of T. flavidulus in a climatic chamber at five different temperatures. The results showed that the functional responses of those predators reflected the Holling type II functional response and were density dependent and positively related to temperature. For the three predatory mites, predation and successful attack rates increased with increasing temperature up to 26A degrees C, reducing afterward. Handling time had the opposite trend. Reproductive ability also increased with an increase in temperature and prey consumption.									8	3	0	0	9	0	11			1519-566X	1678-8052		WOS:000342213800007	27193954

One ecosystem property is the body size of the animals living in the system, which is assumed to depend on temperature or resource availability, among others. For primary consumers, resource availability may directly be related to plant traits, while for secondary consumers the relationship is indirect. We used plant traits to describe resource availability along an elevational gradient on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Using structural equation models, we determined the response of plant traits to changes in precipitation, temperature and disturbance with and assessed whether abiotic conditions or community-weighted means of plant traits are stronger predictors of the mean size of bees, moths, frugivorous birds, and insectivorous birds. Traits indicating tissue density and nutrient content strongly responded to variations in precipitation, temperature and disturbance. They had direct effects on pollination and fruit traits. However, the average body sizes of the animal groups considered could only be explained by temperature and habitat structure, not by plant traits. Our results demonstrate a strong link between traits and the abiotic environment, but suggest that temperature is the most relevant predictor of mean animal body size. Community-weighted means of plant traits and body sizes appear unsuitable to capture the complexity of plant-animal interactions.									6	1	0	0	6	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000398945800054	28319155

It is important that we understand, and ideally predict, these impacts. Here, we compare predatory impacts of size-matched decapod crustaceansinvasive alien Eriocheir sinensis and Pacifastacus leniusculus, and native European Austropotamobius pallipesand use this case study to inform methods for impact prediction. We quantify functional responses (FRs) on three macroinvertebrate prey species, examine switching behaviour, and measure metabolic rates as a possible mechanistic explanation for differences in predation. FRs show a consistent pattern: attack coefficients and maximum feeding rates are ordered E. sinensisP. leniusculusA. pallipes for all prey species. Attack coefficients of E. sinensis are up to 6.7 times greater than those of size-matched crayfish and maximum feeding rates up to 3.0 times greater. FR parameters also differ between the invasive and native crayfish, but only up to 2.6 times. We find no evidence of switching behaviour in crayfish but suggestions of negative switching in E. sinensis. Differences in FR parameters are mirrored by differences in routine, but not standard, metabolic rate. Overall, our data predict strong predatory impacts of E. sinensis, even relative to alien P. leniusculus. Strong impacts of P. leniusculus relative to A. pallipes may be driven more by body size or abundance than per capita effect. FRs vary between prey types in line with existing knowledge of impacts, supporting the use of FRs in quantitative, prey-specific impact predictions. MRs could offer a general mechanistic explanation for differences in predatory behaviour and impacts.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000445069800013

Young eggs less than 24 h old were used as prey. Under all experimental conditions most eggs were only partially consumed, confirming the general theory that predatory mites leave most of the food content unutilized. A mean predation rate of 2.2-7.0 eggs destroyed in 24 h was found, reflecting that a large proportion of the available prey was destroyed. The result supports the view that the predatory mite B. tarsalis could be a relevant biological control agent against E kuehniella in flour mills. It was further demonstrated that frozen moth eggs can be considered as an appropriate food source. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Comparative Bioenergetics Modeling of Two Lake Trout Morphotypes								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				143	6			1592	1604		10.1080/00028487.2014.954051				2014	2014	Efforts to restore Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Laurentian Great Lakes have been hampered for decades by several factors, including overfishing and invasive species (e. g., parasitism by Sea Lampreys Petromyzon marinus and reproductive deficiencies associated with consumption of Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus). Restoration efforts are complicated by the presence of multiple body forms (i. e., morphotypes) of Lake Trout that differ in habitat utilization, prey consumption, lipid storage, and spawning preferences. Bioenergetics models constitute one tool that is used to help inform management and restoration decisions; however, bioenergetic differences among morphotypes have not been evaluated. The goal of this research was to investigate bioenergetic differences between two actively stocked morphotypes: lean and humper Lake Trout. We measured consumption and respiration rates across a wide range of temperatures (4-22 degrees C) and size-classes (5-100 g) to develop bioenergetics models for juvenile Lake Trout. Bayesian estimation was used so that uncertainty could be propagated through final growth predictions. Differences between morphotypes were minimal, but when present, the differences were temperature and weight dependent. Basal respiration did not differ between morphotypes at any temperature or size-class. When growth and consumption differed between morphotypes, the differences were not consistent across the size ranges tested. Management scenarios utilizing the temperatures presently found in the Great Lakes (e. g., predicted growth at an average temperature of 11.7 degrees C and 14.4 degrees C during a 30-d period) demonstrated no difference in growth between the two morphotypes. Due to a lack of consistent differences between lean and humper Lake Trout, we developed a model that combined data from both morphotypes. The combined model yielded results similar to those of the morphotype-specific models, suggesting that accounting for morphotype differences may not be necessary in bioenergetics modeling of lean and humper Lake Trout.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000345706800018

Comparisons of functional responses can improve our understanding of underlying processes involved in altering species interaction strengths and may predict the effect of species invading new communities. Therefore, we investigated the functional responses of the mourning gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris (Dumeril & Bibron, 1836) to explore how temperature, body-size and prey density alter gecko predatory impacts in ecosystems. We quantified the functional responses of juvenile and adult geckos in single-predator experiments at 20, 23 and 26 degrees C. Both displayed saturating Type-II functional responses, but juvenile functional responses and the novel Functional Response Ratio were positively affected by temperature as juvenile attack rates (a) increased as a function of increased temperature. Handling times (h) tended to shorten at higher temperature for both predator stages. We demonstrate that the effects of temperature on functional responses of geckos differ across ontogeny, perhaps reflecting life-history stages prioritising growth and maturation or body maintenance. This indicates that temperature-dependent gecko predatory impacts will be mediated by population demographics. We advocate further comparisons of functional responses to understand the invasiveness and future predatory impacts of geckos, and other invasive species globally, as temperatures change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000543969500020	32572111

Ectothermic omnivores increase herbivory in response to rising temperature								OIKOS				129	7			1028	1039		10.1111/oik.07082		MAR 2020		JUL 2020	2020	Higher temperatures as a consequence of global climate change may considerably alter trophic interactions. Ectothermic herbivores and carnivores generally ingest more food with rising temperature as their metabolic rates increase with rising temperature. However, omnivorous ectotherms may respond in two ways: quantitatively by consuming more food and qualitatively by altering their degree of herbivory or carnivory through a diet shift. We hypothesize that rising temperature will increase herbivory of ectothermic omnivores as herbivory increases towards the equator. We tested the hypothesis in a freshwater model system in which ectothermic omnivores are prevalent, by applying two approaches, a temperature manipulation experiment and a literature study. We performed feeding trials with a juvenile aquatic ectothermic omnivore (pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) at different temperatures ranging from 12 to 27 degrees C, supplying them with both animal food and plant material, and directly quantified their consumption rates over time. The results showed that snails cultured at high temperatures (> 21 degrees C) increased the proportion of plant material in their diets after 17 days, which supports our hypothesis. In the literature survey, we found that rising temperature increased herbivory in multiple aquatic animal taxa, including zooplankton, amphibians, crayfish, fish and snails. This suggests that aquatic ectothermic omnivores might commonly increase herbivory with rising temperature. The mechanisms underlying this temperature-induced diet shift are not sufficiently explained by current theories related to the physiology, metabolism and stoichiometry of omnivores. We propose to incorporate the animals' ontogenetic development in the temperature metabolic stoichiometry hypothesis as a complementary explanation for the diet shift, namely that the diet shift could be due to faster development of the ectotherms and an earlier ontogenetic diet shift at higher temperatures. We conclude that future global warming will most likely alter food webs by increasing the top-down control of aquatic herbivores and omnivores on primary producers.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000522509500001

The local impacts of thermal regime change are challenging to predict because water temperature can influence aquatic organisms and communities at multiple levels simultaneously. For example, thermal change can influence the phenology of periphyton blooms, primary consumer physiology and behaviour, and interspecific interactions with predators. Using tadpoles of the threatened river-breeding foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii, Ranidae), their algal foods and their invertebrate predators, we mimicked dam-induced changes in temperature and observed the outcome of consumer-resource interactions. In stream enclosures, we reared tadpoles across a gradient of cold to warm conditions, quantified the ash content of diet, digestive efficiency and growth rate, and assessed their vulnerability to hemipteran and odonate predators. Tadpoles reared in a cool stream (15.5 degrees C daily mean) digested epilithic periphyton poorly (6.60.4% assimilation efficiency). In contrast, average assimilation efficiency of tadpoles reared at 19 degrees C was 11.60.1%. Access to nutritious diatoms (i.e. dinitrogen-fixing Epithemia spp., Rhopalodiaceae) increased assimilation efficiency to 10.1 +/- 0.1% and 13.8 +/- 0.1% in the cool and warm treatments, respectively. Assimilation efficiency correlated positively with tadpole growth rate (R=0.66, p<.001). The effect of temperature on mortality due to predation was mediated by low tadpole growth rates at cool temperatures and not by the temperature of predator exposure. Non-lethal effects of predators on tadpole growth and tail injury, however, depended on both rearing temperature and exposure temperature. Contrary to the expectation that the cost of predator avoidance behaviours may be greater at warmer exposure temperatures because basal metabolic rates are higher, our results indicated that the energetic cost of foraging less was amplified at cool temperatures. Our results show that when thermal conditions impair digestion in a species' early life stages, recruitment bottlenecks are likely to arise due to the combined negative effects of cool temperatures on assimilation efficiency and growth, and increased predation by invertebrates.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000441693300001

Bionomics of the African Apefly (Spalgis lemolea) as A Potential Natural Enemy of the Papaya Mealybug (Paracoccus marginatus) in Tanzania								SUSTAINABILITY				12	8					3155	10.3390/su12083155				APR 2020	2020	The African apefly (Spalgis lemolea Druce) is a potential natural enemy of the papaya mealybug (Paracoccus marginatus Williams and Granara de Willink). We studied the life history of apeflies in the laboratory at a temperature of 25-27 degrees C and a relative humidity of 55%-65% under a 12 h photoperiod condition. The papaya mealybugs and apefly larvae were collected from papaya plants in Tengeru, Arusha, Tanzania. The papaya mealybugs were introduced and allowed to multiply on potted sprouting potato plants in screened cages. In order to study the life cycle and predation of apeflies, an apefly egg was placed on an open screen-covered petri dish containing a moist blotter paper and observed for larva emergence. After the apefly larva emergence, a mixture of mealybug eggs (up to 1500), nymphs (200-250) and adults (100-150) was introduced in the petri dish each day and the consumption rate by the apefly larvae was quantified until the larvae reached pupal stage. Then, the apefly adults were collected and put into cages 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm containing cotton wool soaked in water, for observation of pre-mating, mating, egg-laying and life span. Results indicate that the apefly completed its life cycle in 23 days. The mean development period of the eggs was four days and the development period for the larva, pre-pupa, and pupa was nine, one and ten days respectively. The adult apefly emerged after 9 days of the pupa stage with mean body lengths of 10.1 +/- 0.4 mm and 11.0 +/- 0.8 mm for the males and females, respectively. The female laid an average of 68 eggs in groups of two to seven at different sites after 4-5 days of emergence. In this study one apefly larva was capable of consuming about 1983 +/- 117, 123 +/- 6 and 80 +/- 9 papaya mealybug eggs, nymphs and adults respectively during larval stage. These results reveal the predatory potential of the apefly in suppressing the population of papaya mealybugs under field conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2071-1050		WOS:000535598700088

Elevated temperatures are predicted to have differential effects on species across trophic levels, due to asymmetric sensitivity to temperature changes. In this study, we examined the direct effects of three temperature regimes (16, 20 and 24 A degrees C) that reflect present and, potentially, future climate conditions on the response of Salix spp. plants, an important bioenergy crop, and its most damaging herbivore (Phratora vulgatissima) and an efficient natural enemy (the omnivorous predator Orthotylus marginalis). We found that plant growth, herbivore oviposition and enemy egg-foraging rate correlated positively with temperature. In the event of elevated temperatures following global climatic changes, these species could potentially respond in tandem. Still, the strength of responses varied among species, with herbivore and natural enemy exhibiting a similar and steeper rate of response relative to plants. Additionally, the herbivore's response was influenced by plant quality with altered oviposition rates depending on whether it was fed the (previously determined) resistant Salix dasyclados or susceptible S. viminalis. This indicates that host plant chemistry has the potential to mediate differential responses to temperature. Together, our results suggest that indirect effects of elevated temperatures, leading to a disruption of trophic associations, may be less likely or less severe in this tri-trophic system.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1872-8855	1872-8847		WOS:000365123900003

In this study, the life table parameters and predation rate of Typhlodromus bagdasarjani Wainstein & Arutunjan were determined on two-spotted spider mites reared on a susceptible (Isfahan) or a resistant (Neishabour) eggplant cultivar. All experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions, at 25 +/- A 1 A degrees C, 60 +/- A 5 % RH and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. A significant difference was observed between mean developmental time of immature stages of T. bagdasarjani on the two eggplant cultivars: 6.6 versus 7.5 days, on the susceptible and resistant cultivar, respectively. Net reproductive rate (R (0)) of T. bagdasarjani did not differ between the cultivars. Doubling time on the susceptible and resistant cultivars was 3.48 versus 5.72 days, mean generation time (T) was 10.13 versus 16.08 days, respectively. Total fecundity was higher on susceptible than on resistant eggplants, the intrinsic rate of population increase (r) was 0.188 versus 0.119 day(-1), respectively. Daily and total prey consumption of various life stages of T. bagdasarjani on two-spotted spider mite reared on susceptible versus resistant eggplant differed; total consumption was higher on spider mites reared on the resistant cultivar. However, the lower intrinsic rate of increase and higher mortality of the predator on the resistant eggplant (Neishabour) revealed that more attention should be devoted to integrated control of spider mites using resistant cultivars and phytoseiid mites.									29	0	0	0	27	1	30			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000335724300007	24599555	
J	Benke, Arthur C.; Wallace, J. Bruce								High secondary production in a Coastal Plain river is dominated by snag invertebrates and fuelled mainly by amorphous detritus								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				60	2			236	255		10.1111/fwb.12460				FEB 2015	2015	The 2-years production dynamics of major taxa (family/order) and functional feeding groups was synthesised from detailed production analyses previously published for all major invertebrate species/genera (retained by a 100m sieve) found on snags (submerged wood) in a sixth-order south-eastern U.S. Coastal Plain river. The trophic basis of this production and annual consumption of six food types were quantified. Invertebrate production (148 and 203g dry mass m(-2)year(-1) of snag surfaces for the 2years) was among the highest ever measured for a specific habitat in non-polluted or unregulated rivers and was still relatively high when converted to overall area of the river bed (48 and 70gm(-2)year(-1)). Snag production constituted 73% of total main-channel production (production from snag and river bed combined). Chironomidae (40-44% over the 2years), Ephemeroptera (14-21%) and Trichoptera (25-31%) together represented the majority (88-93%) of the putative production of primary consumers on snags. Functional group analysis showed that fine filterers (26-36% over the 2years), gatherers (36-44%) and macro-filterers (21-25%) represented the majority of total invertebrate production. Production of predaceous insects (mostly Plecoptera, Odonata and Megaloptera) represented only 5-7% of the total. Production of the three major taxa and three major functional groups was remarkably consistent over 2years of monthly sampling, despite strong seasonal variation in discharge/light/temperature and production of individual genera and families. Seventy-nine per cent of production by primary consumers was supported by microbially enriched amorphous detritus, the major component of seston originating primarily from floodplain forests. Invertebrates consumed 357g AFDMm(-2) (river bed) year(-1) of seston, 325gm(-2)year(-1) of amorphous detritus and 20gm(-2)year(-1) of diatoms. Dividing seston consumption by seston transport indicated that 67% of seston was consumed over 100km of river length. Consumption was higher than autochthonous net primary production, supporting other evidence that terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter, incorporated via the microbial loop, is the main trophic basis of this riverine food web. Macro-filtering hydropsychid caddisflies were omnivorous with > half their production from carnivory. Snag predators, including hydropsychids, consumed 60% (29gm(-2)year(-1) of river bed) of invertebrate production (assumed to be from snags), leaving the remainder for emergence, downstream transport and consumption by fish.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000347706400002		
J	Chen, Xu; Xiao, Da; Du, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Fan; Zang, Liansheng; Wang, Su								Impact of polymorphism and abiotic conditions on prey consumption by Harmonia axyridis								ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS				39	3-4			251	258		10.1127/entomologia/2019/0874				2019	2019	Polymorphic diversity, such as elytra patterns of insects, is regarded as an external phenotypic characteristic driven by both genetics and environmental pleiotropy. The multicolored Asian ladybird, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), both an efficient natural enemy of herbivores and an invasive species with a worldwide distribution, shows a multitude of elytral patterns and strong environmental adaptability. Some studies have documented differences of ecological adaptability among H. axyridis morphotypes, but none compared their predatory performance under differing environmental conditions, to further understand the evolutionary significance of elytral pattern diversity. We evaluated predation (number of prey consumed per time unit) on three different herbivores by melanic/succinic and male/female adults of H. axyridis, under different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 degrees C). and photoperiods (4:20, 8:16, 12:12, 16:8, 20:4). We found significant differences in prey consumed by the predator between gender and polymorphic types, including under comparable environment parameters. Furthermore, there were also significant differences in predation when temperature and photoperiod regimes varied. Our results hinted a high plasticity in prey consumption relative to polymorphic type and gender in H. axyridis. These findings could be informative for developing further biological control programs relying on H. axyridis, notably for optimizing the effectiveness of predator releases according to polymorph to be used and environment targeted.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0171-8177	2363-7102		WOS:000505166900007

The temperature dependance of these processes-which are the underlying mechanisms of ecological dynamics-is often thought to be exponential or unimodal, generally supported by short-term experiments. However, ecological dynamics unfold over many generations. Our goal was to empirically document shifts in predator-prey cycles over the full range of temperatures that can possibly support a predator-prey system and then to uncover the effect of temperature on the underlying mechanisms driving those changes.Methods: We measured the population dynamics of the Didinium-Paramecium predator-prey system across a wide range of temperatures to reveal systematic changes in the dynamics of the system. We then used ordinary differential equation fitting to estimate parameters of a model describing the dynamics, and used these estimates to assess the long-term temperature dependance of all the underlying mechanisms.Results: We found that predator-prey cycles shrank in state space from colder to hotter temperatures and that both cycle period and amplitude varied with temperature. Model parameters showed mostly unimodal responses to temperature, with one parameter (predator mortality) increasing monotonically with temperature and one parameter (predator conversion efficiency) invariant with temperature. Our results indicate that temperature can have profound, systematic effects on ecological dynamics, and these can arise through diverse and simultaneous changes in multiple underlying mechanisms. Predicting the effects of temperature on ecological dynamics may require additional investigation into how the underlying drivers of population dynamics respond to temperature beyond a short-term, acute response.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000541398400012	32596054

They are highly variable with regards to vegetation structure and physico-chemical features that potentially mediate outcomes of biotic interactions. Multiple environmental variables and their emergent impacts on the relationship between prey consumption rate by a predator and prey density (functional response), however, are rarely assessed. Here, we investigated the combined effects of temperature and habitat complexity on the functional response of the freshwater predatory notonectid Enithares sobria on the cladoceran prey organism Daphnia longispina. A Type II functional response was observed for E. sobria predating on D. longispina and while temperature and habitat complexity had no effect on the response type, these environmental variables interacted with consequences for the magnitude of the functional responses. Overall, structural complexity favored the predator as greater consumption was observed in the most complex habitat treatment. Temperature effects were also evident although these effects were not unidirectional with regard to treatment factor gradients as predators were the most successful at intermediary temperatures. Furthermore, there was a complex interplay between habitat complexity and temperature, with attack rates being greatest at low and high complexities within intermediate temperatures, while at zero complexity attack rates were greatest at the lowest temperature. The effect of habitat on handling times was only evident in the low temperature treatments which decreased steadily with each increase in complexity. Through the application of functional responses the synergistic effects of multiple environmental drivers on predator-prey interaction outcomes have been highlighted, adding insight into how interactions among species may be affected by natural or artificially induced environmental variability.									31	0	0	0	29	0	31			2150-8925			WOS:000374896300019

Experiments were performed in the acclimatized room under 28 +/- 1A degrees C, 60 A +/- 10% r.h. and a photoperiod of 16:8 h(L:D) conditions. To determine the biological features of the coccinellid, predator individuals were continuously observed from egg stage to end of adult stage. The development, survival and fecundity of N. kreissli were determined and all the measured data were recorded daily. The total development time from egg to the eclosion of adult stage was determined as 31.6 A +/- 0.4 days. The lifespan of males and females was 66.0 A +/- 3.8 and 65.8 A +/- 3.5 days, respectively; and a single female laid 122.6 eggs. The raw data related to life history were analyzed by using the age-stage, two-sex life table. The intrinsic rate of increase, the net reproductive rate, and the mean generation time were 0.0709 A +/- 0.0036 d(-1), 53.1 A +/- 9.5 offspring and 55.8 A +/- 1.3 days, respectively. The first and second instars of N. kreissli preferred egg stages of P. ficus to other stages of mealybug. On the other hand, third and fourth instars and adult predators preferred the second and third instar nymphs and adult females of the prey. It was determined that the egg consumption of N. kreissli increased with the development of larval stages, and that the highest consumption was recorded in its fourth instar.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0334-2123			WOS:000316085300011

Fish and zooplankton samples and water temperature data were collected twice per month from February to December 1993. Simulation results indicated wide seasonal variations in consumption and growth rates. Growth was in general slow; especially in age-group 6 the net increase in weight was slight. The fit of the model to the weight data was good, and the model was able to follow even rapid seasonal variations in the weight. There were clear changes in the diet during the year. In March, when the food intake was reduced, copepods, mainly adult calanoids, formed the bulk of the food consumed. The most intensive consumption period lasted from June to late September. Chironomid pupae and planktonic cladocerans were the major summer food items. The largest individuals fed mainly on molluscs during summer. Zooplankton survey and consumption estimates did not show directly that the population density of copepodids and adults of Eudiaptomus graciloides were affected by whitefish predation although their population density decreased in spring. Nauplii, showing the maximum population density in April, were not consumed. The role of copepod consumption in the timing of Diphyllobothrium ditremum plerocercoid transmission to whitefish was also discussed. The increased copepod consumption rate during winter results in high energy intake but also an increased risk of food transmitted parasite infection.									18	0	1	0	17	0	20			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000080235900015

In Florida, CAS was first reported in Miami in 1996 and is now present in 43 Florida counties. Chemical control of CAS can be effective, but it is expensive, and insecticides must be frequently and regularly applied. Recent surveys of natural enemies in Thailand identified a new potential biological control agent of CAS. The objective of this study was to examine the temperature requirements and consumption rates of Phaenochilus kashaya Giorgi and Vandenberg (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Survival, developmental time and number of scales consumed by P. kashaya were measured at four constant temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C). In addition, adult longevity and consumption were recorded at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Phaenochilus kashaya completed development to adulthood at temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees C. The highest survival rate (48%) was obtained at 25 degrees C, and the accumulated degree-days for this species was 714. Phaenochilus kashaya is a voracious predator of CAS, consuming 380 scales during the larval stage and an estimated 4700 scales during the adult stage. Adult longevity varied from 59 days at 30 degrees C to 220 days at 20 degrees C for females, and 31 days at 30 degrees C to 148 days at 20 degrees C for males. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0.34 at 20 degrees C, which is high compared with other coccinellid species. According to this study, P. kashaya has the potential to be an effective biological control agent of the CAS in Florida.									2	1	0	0	3	0	3			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000315204600001

We quantified trout diet, growth, and consumption in small headwater tributaries characterized as cold with low food and high trout density, larger tributaries characterized as cold with moderate food and moderate trout density, and large main stems characterized as warm with high food and low trout density. Brook trout consumption was highest in the main stem where diets shifted from insects in headwaters to fishes and crayfish in larger streams. Despite high water temperatures, trout growth rates also were consistently highest in the main stem, likely due to competitively dominant trout monopolizing thermal refugia. Temporal changes in trout density had a direct negative effect on brook trout growth rates. Our results suggest that competition for food constrains brook trout growth in small streams, but access to thermal refugia in productive main stem habitats enables dominant trout to supplement growth at a watershed scale. Brook trout conservation in this region should seek to relieve the "temperature-productivity squeeze," whereby brook trout productivity is constrained by access to habitats that provide both suitable water temperature and sufficient prey.									16	1	0	0	16	0	18			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000330967900011		
B	Sunderland, KD						Symondson, WOC; Liddell, JE		Progress in quantifying predation using antibody techniques								ECOLOGY OF AGRICULTURAL PESTS: BIOCHEMICAL APPROACHES		SYSTEMATICS ASSOCIATION SPECIAL VOLUMES			53			419	455						1996	1996	The majority of early research, employing biochemical approaches for estimating predation of agricultural pests, simply used the proportion of positive results in the precipitin test as an index of predation. This approach was gradually improved by incorporating estimates of predator density into predation indices and by allowing for the temperature-dependent rates of antigen digestion characteristic of each species of predator. Further advances came with the use of ELISA, which enabled estimation of the biomass of prey in the gut of an individual predator, and with the development of monoclonal antibodies, which greatly increased the specificity of prey detection in predator guts.The above approach, in common with other indirect or post-mortem techniques (such as electrophoresis), estimates the consumption rate of prey by predators, rather than the predation rate. It is necessary to make this distinction because prey which have not been killed by the predator can, nevertheless, be consumed by it. Conversely, the predator may kill prey but fail to ingest any prey material. Thus consumption and predation are not always synonymous. A knowledge of consumption rates is useful in energetics studies, but information on predation rates is required in investigations of pest control by predators. To convert consumption rates to predation rates (or simply to obtain a crude estimate of the extent to which the measured consumption rates are reliable indices of predation rates) requires, potentially, a large amount of additional information about the specific predator-prey system under investigation. Examples of the extra information required include: (i) the propertion of the prey biomass detected per predator that is due to ingestion of dead prey (scavenging), and ingestion of moribund prey (in the early stages of parasitism and pathogenesis); (ii) the incidence of secondary predation, which results in mis-identification of the primary consumer of the prey (food chain errors); (iii) the extent to which there is pre-oral digestion, partial prey consumption, killing without ingestion (wasteful killing), and wounding of prey that eventually results in death; and (iv) prey size availability in relation to the prey size preference of the predator. Each of these factors may vary according to predator species, hunger level of the predator, prey species, season, crop type and location within the habitat.While it is not feasible to collect all of the above information for each predator-prey system under study, it would be extremely valuable to begin to estimate the order of magnitude of the main categories of potential error in predation rate estimates, at least for a few representative predator-prey systems. This would separate factors of negligible significance from potentially important factors, which might then have to be measured routinely in predation studies. Without such investigations, the possibility will remain that many published predation rate estimates are grossly in error, and that predators have been incorrectly ranked in terms of their probable contribution to the control of specific pests.

Currently, chemical control is used as no commercially available biocontrol agent is effective at these temperatures. In this study, two potential biocontrol agents were evaluated: the silverfly, Leucopis glyphinivora Tanasijtshuk (Diptera: Chamaemyiidae), and the American hoverfly, Eupeodes americanus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Syrphidae). Active flight, oviposition, and larval voracity were tested at 12, 15, and 18 degrees C. The proportion of individuals demonstrating flight decreased at 12 degrees C for the hoverfly and decreased at 15 and 12 degrees C for the silverfly. Delay before active flight was greater for both species at 12 degrees C. More hoverflies laid eggs after 7 d at all temperatures (12, 15, and 18 degrees C) compared with silverflies. Hoverflies laid a higher number of eggs than silverflies at all temperatures. When given an additional 7 d at 12 degrees C, oviposition increased for both species. Daily aphid consumption decreased as temperature decreased for both species, but average total aphid consumption did not decrease regardless of the temperature. This means that larval voracity for both the silvery and the American hoverfly was similar at all temperatures (12, 15, and 18 degrees C) when considering aphid development. Hoverfly larvae consumed two times more aphids than silverfly larvae at all temperatures. This study demonstrates a clear superiority of the hoverfly over the silverfly at low temperatures and identifies it as a potential biocontrol agent of the foxglove aphid.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1536-2442	2250-2645		WOS:000455173000001	30605529

In this study, we determined the daily and total prey consumption of different life stages of Ty. bagdasarjani on Tetranychus urticae Koch nymphs at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C, relative humidity of 60 +/- 10% and a photoperiod of 16: 8 h (light : dark). The results showed a significant effect of temperature on food consumption by Ty. bagdasarjani. The number of prey consumed daily by protonymphs increased with increasing temperature from 15 (0.8 preys) to 25 degrees C (3.5 preys), and then decreased at 30 (2.8 preys) and 35 degrees C (3.1 preys). The daily predation of the other life stages of Ty. bagdasarjani followed a similar trend as that which occurred in protonymphs, with the exception of post-oviposition period, in which the highest values for the mean prey consumption were observed at 30 degrees C (6.6 preys/day). The highest means for the daily and total prey consumption of females were observed during oviposition, when they devoured an average of 2.7, 5.3, 10.1, 10.9, and 11.0 prey/day and 173.7, 255.9, 244.8, 259.0, and 185.8 prey in their entire period of oviposition at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C, respectively. During adult life, the maximum number of prey was consumed at 20 degrees C (432.7), which may be because of the longer period of adulthood at lower temperatures. Therefore, the efficiency of this predator in control of T. urticae populations could be higher at temperatures of above 20 degrees C.									21	1	0	0	19	0	21			0164-7954	1945-3892		WOS:000299877300009

However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator-prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator-prey interactions. This implies that warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator-prey oscillations thus stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however, include predator starvation due to energetic inefficiency despite abundant resources.									147	2	0	0	135	0	148			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000286837900005

The two species were treated at normal (Mean: 17.8 degrees C, Max: 21.8 degrees C, Min: 13.4 degrees C) and elevated (Mean: 20.8 degrees C, Max: 25.5 degrees C, Min: 15.7 degrees C) daily temperature profile from first instar to 10-day-old adult and fed S. avenae ad libitum. Elevated temperatures caused higher consumption rates in both coccinellids but different responses in weight gain and body fat accumulation within the first 10 days of adulthood. Harmonia axyridis males were poor converters of consumed biomass into body weight and H. axyridis females showed the lowest efficiencies for converting food into body fat content, particularly at elevated temperatures. These results show different temperature-dependent responses of C. septempunctata and H. axyridis and are discussed in relation to their different biology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-3829	1861-3837		WOS:000332754700006

Using weeds seeds natural predators as a weed control strategy can be a valuable alternative to herbicide use. Among natural predators, ground beetles (Coleoptera, family Carabidae) have been claimed to be one of the most important invertebrate seeds predators in agroecosystems. However, information on the trophic relationship among these two large communities is fragmentary. Laboratory experiments have been conducted using a wide variety of protocols on a few ground beetle and weed seed species. To better characterize trophic relationship among these communities, a standardized and simple protocol is required. We propose a protocol to quantitatively assess weed seed consumption by ground beetles. Importantly, we explore parameters that should be optimized and fixed since they are not targeted, such as fasting time, test duration and substrate type. We also investigate whether, and under which conditions, tests may be replicated with the same individuals. Tests were carried out on five ground beetle species and eight weed seed species, though in the majority of tests Viola arvensis was used. Using climatic chambers, parameters such as temperature, humidity and photoperiod were fixed at 25 degrees C, 70% and 17-h/7-h day/night, respectively. Fasting time prior testing and test duration were fixed to 3 days and 24 h, respectively, to avoid mortality of ground beetle species that do not rely on seeds as their main food. Also, a recovery period of 24 h between successive tests is required when multiple tests are conducted on the same individuals. Among the substrate tested, we recommend to use sand as it appeared the most convenient substrate to conduct a large amount of replicated experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1872-8855	1872-8847		WOS:000491403300001

Physiological processes in general are sensitive to temperature. Thus, the temperature at which predators and prey interact may shape physiological response to predation risk. We measured and evaluated how temperature and predation risk affected growth rates of predaceous damselfly nymphs (Enallagma vesperum, Odonata: Coenagrionidae). First, we conducted growth trials at five temperatures crossed with two levels of predation risk (fish predator present versus absent) and measured growth rates, consumption rates, assimilation efficiencies, and production efficiencies of 107 individual damselflies. Second, we used a model to evaluate if and how component physiological responses to predation risk affected growth rates across temperatures. In the absence of mortality threat, growth rates of damselflies increased with warming until about 23.5 A degrees C and then began to decline, a typical unimodal response to changes in temperature. Under predation risk, growth rates were lower and the shape of the thermal response was less apparent. Higher metabolic and survival costs induced by predation risk were only partially offset by changes in consumption rates and assimilation efficiencies and the magnitude of non-consumptive effects varied as a function of temperature. Furthermore, we documented that thermal physiology was mediated by predation risk, a known driver of organismal physiology that occurs in the context of species interactions. A general understanding of climatic impacts on ectothermic populations requires consideration of the community context of thermal physiology, including non-consumptive effects of predators.									34	1	0	0	31	1	35			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000344599000005	25234372

Coccinella septempunctata larvae developed more rapidly and consumed fewer total aphids as temperature increased, although when the number of aphids consumed per day were examined, only those larvae reared at 15-degrees-C consumed significantly less aphids than at any other regime. All other regimes were not significantly different. The developmental threshold and degree-days over the threshold needed for complete development were estimated at 11.7-degrees-C and 275 days, respectively. Hippodamia convergens did not develop to the adult stage at 15-degrees-C, although complete development was observed at the other four temperature regimes. At the temperature regimes where development was observed, H. convergens, in general, also took fewer days to develop and consumed fewer total aphids as temperature increased. On an aphids per day basis, H. convergens consumption was not significantly different in the temperature range of 20-30-degrees-C. The developmental threshold and degree-days to complete development for H. convergens were estimated as 6.7-degrees-C and 351 degree-days, respectively.									16	0	0	0	12	0	16			0147-1724			WOS:A1991FK93500010

Temporary patches where sown plants are poorly developed (hereafter "field defects") are likely to increase with climate change and can be colonized by other plant species. Although perennial non-crop habitats can act as refuges for beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes and increase ecosystem services (ESs) in neighbouring arable fields, the relevance of field defects is unknown. Here, we quantified two ESs (pest and weed seed predation) in field defects within oilseed rape crops and related the ES levels with the activity-density of ground beetles and temperature. In 10 fields, we used artificial caterpillars made of plasticine and seed cards of two weed species (Taraxacum sp. and Stellaria sp.) to quantify the ESs in two sampling periods (spring and summer) and three habitat types: field defects, crops grown in standard conditions (field interiors) and crop-defect boundaries. Ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps and classified into feeding guilds and body-size classes. Insects and mammals were the main pest predators, and predation increased in summer but did not differ among habitats. Seed predation rates for both species were significantly higher in summer. Predation upon Taraxacum seeds was higher in the field interiors, whereas the predation rate upon Stellaria seeds was significantly higher in the field interiors and defects compared to that in the crop-defect boundaries. The predation rate by insects increased with the activity-density of the medium- and large-sized carnivorous carabids, whereas the seed predation rate for both weed species was positively related to the activity-density of medium-sized herbivorous carabids. Finally, the mean and maximum temperatures were negatively linked to the predation rates on artificial caterpillars and seeds of Taraxacum, respectively. Our results suggest that these ephemeral habitats are not related to a strong decrease in ecosystem services; thus, field defects may not cause substantial changes in ES provisioning. We confirmed that ground beetles are important providers of both investigated ESs and showed that microclimatic conditions might play an important role in the regulation of ESs in agroeco-systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000527595400012

We studied the thermotolerance of the ladybeetle Serangium japonicum Chapin (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), an important native predator of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) in China. Serangium japonicum eggs, first- and fourth-instar larvae, pupae, and adults were subjected to a range of high temperatures (36, 39, 42, 43.5, and 45 degrees C) at intervals between 15 and 720 min. Survival was compromised and declined sharply for all life stages at temperatures of 42 degrees C and higher. First instars were the least heat tolerant, and eggs were typically the most resistant. Egg predation by S. japonicum did not differ whether the adult beetles were subjected to either heat shock or starvation first. Heat shock treatments at 36 degrees C did not impede adult egg consumption, treatments at 39 degrees C crippled ladybeetle's egg consumption for 8 h following treatment but recovered predatory capacity within 24 h after treatment. However, treatments at 42 degrees C greatly impaired ladybeetle's predatory capacity. After experiencing heat shock at 39 and 42 degrees C, adults significantly increased the amount of time they spent resting, which is the probable cause of predation decline after heat exposure. These results demonstrate that short periods of extreme heat exposures have a detrimental impact on S. japonicum survival and predation, but the effect was dependent on duration and life stage. Overall, these findings can help predict population dynamics and success of biological control of whitefly by S. japonicum in a warming world.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000474290300010

J	Huryn, Alexander D.; Benstead, Jonathan P.								Seasonal changes in light availability modify the temperature dependence of secondary production in an Arctic stream								ECOLOGY				100	6					e02690	10.1002/ecy.2690				JUN 2019	2019	Light and temperature are key drivers of ecosystem productivity, but synchrony of their annual cycles typically obscures their relative influence. The coupling of annual light-temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69 degrees N, annual water temperature range 4-7 degrees C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light-temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000474127300001	30854634

Number of daily prey consumption consumed decreased gradually as the age of T. univittatus adults increased. In the 1st week, the total mean number of consumed preys by single predator was 32.88 beetles, while in the 14th week, it was 8.0 beetles. The average of total consumption for a single predator through its life time was 195.1 +/- 14.003 beetles. Therefore, the adult is fairly considered an efficient predator as it was able to consume a high number of preys. Studies included also the fecundity of the predator. The pre-ovipositional, ovipositional, and post-ovipositional periods at 30 degrees C were 2.0, 42.0 and 1.3 days, respectively. Highest mean daily number of deposited eggs was 55.7/ female, obtained on the 10thday of ovipositional period. The total average number of eggs laid per female was 1007.0 eggs. Therefore, the fecundity of the predator is relatively high: Generation period and efficacy of the predator was also studied. The total mean number of emerged Lyctus from Poinciana 10 and 20 days post infestation with Lyctus was zero while the number of emerged predators was also zero after 10 days and 2 adults/ cut after 20 days. Correspondent numbers in the control control were 182.25 +/- 6.46 and 216.3 +/- 7.16 adults/ cut after 10 and 20 days, respectively. 30 days post infestation with Lyctus, the total mean number of emerged Lyctus and predator were 96.5 +/- 12.5731 and 10.25 +/- 2.658, respectively, compared with 232 +/- 11.73/ cut in the control. After 25 days of infestation with 100 Lyctus beetles, the total mean number of emerged Lyctus and predator was zero and 12.3 +/- 2.97, respectively compared with 514 +/- 14.74/ cut in the control at 30 degrees C. Incubation period and hatching percentage of T. univittatus at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C were 23.6, 12.5 and 8.5 days, representing 94.7, 97.7 and 96.8%, respectively. Larval-pupal durations were 47.16, 31.4 and 27.7 days. Percentages of development from larva to adult were 74, 80 and 94% at 25, 30 and 32 degrees C, respectively. Temperature threshold of egg incubation period and that of larval-pupal developmental period were 14 and 15 degrees C, respectively.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1110-1768			WOS:000331597600017		
J	Firake, D. M.; Behere, G. T.								Bioecological attributes and physiological indices of invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) infesting ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) plants in India								CROP PROTECTION				137						105233	10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105233				NOV 2020	2020	Invasive fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) of American origin, has recently arrived in Asian countries, found damaging maize and other host plants including ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) in India and China. The ginger is an economically important spice and a medicinal cash crop of Asia. However, apart from just an occurrence, no other information is available hitherto on interaction of FAW and ginger plants. This is the first comprehensive report unfolding the FAW infestation to the ginger crop, including its bioecological and physiological aspects. FAW identity was confirmed at the molecular level by comparing the sequences of the CO I gene of mitochondrial DNA. FAW infestation was higher during mid-July (0.2 larvae/m(2)), when ginger plants were in rhizome initiation stage (critical stage of growth). Besides generalist predators, four natural enemies were found causing a total of 74.03% fortuitous biocontrol of FAW larvae. Biological attributes and nutritional indices of FAW were studied on ginger for 3 consecutive generations. The larval duration has significantly extended; however the body weight and lifetime fecundity were considerably reduced in ginger fed larvae than maize. The Consumption Index (CI), Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Approximate Digestibility (AD) were significantly lower (Mann-Whitney U Test, P < 0.001) in ginger fed FAW larvae compared to its regular host `maize'. Nevertheless, the higher tissue growth (ECI) and more assimilation (ECD) of FAW on ginger indicate it as a suitable alternate host plant and FAW may cause economic damage under certain circumstances. Insights on ginger plants as a new host of FAW and fortuitous biocontrol aspects of FAW are discussed.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0261-2194	1873-6904		WOS:000566399800003

However, it remains unclear how respiratory surfaces and associated diffusion rates vary with body mass across vertebrates, particularly in relation to the body mass scaling of oxygen consumption rates. Here we address these issues by first quantifying the bodymass dependence of respiratory surface area and respiratory barrier thickness for a diversity of endotherms (birds and mammals) and ectotherms (fishes, amphibians, and reptiles). Based on these findings, we then use Fick's law to predict the body mass scaling of oxygen diffusion for each group. Finally, we compare the predicted body mass dependence of oxygen diffusion to that of oxygen consumption in endotherms and ectotherms. We find that the slopes and intercepts of the relationships describing the body mass dependence of passive oxygen diffusion in these two groups are statistically indistinguishable from those describing the body mass dependence of oxygen consumption. Thus, the area and thickness of respiratory surfaces combine to match oxygen diffusion capacity to oxygen consumption rates in both air-and water-breathing vertebrates. In particular, the substantially lower oxygen consumption rates of ectotherms of a given body mass relative to those of endotherms correspond to differences in oxygen diffusion capacity. These results provide insights into the long-standing effort to understand the structural attributes of organisms that underlie the body mass scaling of oxygen consumption.									21	0	0	0	18	0	21			0027-8424			WOS:000375478800065	27118837	
J	Alzmann, N; Kohler, B; Maier, G								Spatial distribution, food and activity of Gomphus pulchellus SELYS 1840 (Insecta; Odonata; Gomphidae) from a still water habitat								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY				84	3			299	313						1999	1999	Distribution patterns of Gomphus pulchellus larvae in different sediments with different density of prey organisms were studied in the field in a small gravel pit lake in the south of Germany. Larval burrowing behaviour at different temperatures as well as food preference, consumption rates and activity were studied in laboratory experiments. In the study lake G. pulchellus larvae lived exclusively in places where macrophytes were present and in fine sediments (mean grain size <3 mm) with detritus cover. There was a significant positive correlation between larval density and density of food organisms suggesting that abundance of food is one of the determinants of larval distribution. In late autumn larvae migrated to deeper places probably to survive the winter. Low temperatures simulated in laboratory experiments did not induce larvae to burrow deeper. Larvae were always found in a sediment depth of 0.59-0.74 cm. Experiments with mixed prey showed that G. pulchellus larvae preferred tubificid worms and chironomid larvae over gammarids and ephemerid larvae. However, chironomid larvae which stayed in their tubes had a higher survival rate than those outside of tubes. Single-prey experiments showed that G. pulchellus larvae can prey not only on benthic species but also on Daphnia from the open water. Functional-response experiments showed that one G. pulchellus larva consumes a maximum of 2 to 3 tubificid worms or chironomid larvae per day, which corresponds to a maximum biomass (freshweight) of 5 to 30 mg per day. Video recordings of activity showed that G. pulchellus larvae cover long distances of up to 52 m per night on the substrate surface and that activity on the substrate surface started after midnight and ceased before sunrise. Consumption of zooplankton prey and high activity above the substrate is interpreted as an adaptation of G. pulchellus larvae to the life in still water habitats.									4	0	0	0	6	0	6			1434-2944			WOS:000081091900007

Model analyses show that the stability of population dynamics and food web persistence increase with the strength of interference competition. Despite this critical importance for community stability, little is known about how external factors such as the environmental temperature affect intraspecific interference competition.2. We aimed to fill this void by studying the functional responses of two ground beetle species of different body size, Pterostichus melanarius and Poecilus versicolor. These functional response experiments were replicated across four predator densities and two temperatures to address the impact of temperature on intraspecific interference competition.3. We generally expected that warming should increase the speed of movement, encounter rates and in consequence interference among predator individuals. In our experiment, this expectation was supported by the results obtained for the larger predator, P. melanarius, whereas the opposite pattern characterized the interference behaviour of the smaller predator P. versicolor.4. These results suggest potentially nontrivial implications for the effects of environmental temperature on intraspecific interference competition, for which we propose an explanation based on the different sensitivity to warming of metabolic rates of both species. As expected, increasing temperature led to stronger interference competition of the larger species, P. melanarius, which exhibited a weaker increase in metabolic rate with increasing temperature. The stronger increase in the metabolic rate of the smaller predator, P. versicolor, had to be compensated by increasing searching activity for prey, which did not leave time for increasing interference.5. Together, these results suggest that any generalization how interference competition responds to warming should also take the species' metabolic response to temperature increases into account.									57	1	0	0	55	1	58			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000302613300002	22112157

Life tables and schedules of female eggs laid by each female per day were made from records of daily oviposition and adult mortality. The net reproductive rate (ratio of total female births in two successive generations) of C. eruditus varies from 40.7 at 18.5-degrees-C to 74.4 at 25-degrees-C and brackets the net reproductive rates of the prey Lepidoglyphus destructor (Schrank). Mean generation time and finite rates of increase (multiplication per female each day) varied from 52.2 days and 1.073 at 18.5-degrees-C to 24.2 days and 1.194 at 25-degrees-C. Maximum longevity was 107, 67, and 56 days at 18.5, 22, and 25-degrees-C, respectively. Cheyletus eruditus also consumed first-instar larvae of the rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), and first- and second-instar larvae of die flour mill beetle, Cryptolestes turcicus (Grouvelle).									16	2	0	0	14	0	18			0008-4301			WOS:A1991GX85300007

Despite low sea temperatures and high salinity, sea running trout were caught during all sampling occasions in both fjords. The trout had fed extensively oil marine crustaceans (shrimps, amphipods, and krill) and polychaetes during early and late winter, and had a stable or increasing condition factor during this period. In summer and autumn, the trout fed predominantly on fish, mainly juvenile herring. Food consumption rates were lowest during late autumn and early winter (October-December) in both fjords, while trout in the southernmost fjord had the highest consumption rates from April to August and trout in the northernmost fjord from May to September. These patterns in both fjords matched the seasonal variations in condition factor and relative lipid content of the fish during the same periods. The marine winter migration of these northern sea trout populations appears to be a feeding migration in which the fish maintain or increase their body condition, representing a previously undocumented alternative to the more common life history strategy of over-wintering and starvation in freshwater at the northern distribution of this species.

Development time from egg to adult ranged from 22.4 days at 20degreesC to 10.6 days at 35degreesC, and required 278 degree-days above a threshold estimated to be 9.11degreesC. Survival was highest at 25degreesC and lowest at 35degreesC. Longevity of females declined significantly with increasing temperatures, ranging from 120.7 days at 20degreesC to 46.6 days at 35degreesC. Mean generation time became shorter with increasing temperatures. The intrinsic rate of increase of individuals kept at 30degreesC was significantly greater than that of individuals kept at the other temperatures tested. Fourth larval instars and adults of E. nigromaculatus displayed a Type II functional response to Hyalopterus pruni densities. Searching rate of fourth instar larvae and adults was similar, but handling time was shorter for female adults. Results obtained in this study showed that the optimal temperature for population growth of E. nigmmaculatus was 30degreesC and this coccinellid predator may have potential as a biological control agent for H. pruni because of its feeding capacity.									12	0	0	0	13	0	13			0334-2123			WOS:000178564100002		
J	Frank, Thomas; Bramboeck, Martin								Predatory beetles feed more pest beetles at rising temperature								BMC ECOLOGY				16						21	10.1186/s12898-016-0076-x				APR 15 2016	2016	Background: Climate warming is a challenge for many plants and animals as they have to respond to rising temperature. Rising temperature was observed to affect herbivores and predators. Activity-density of abundant predatory carabid beetles, which are considered important natural control agents of agricultural pests, was observed to increase at rising temperature. The pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus is one of the most important insect pests in European oilseed rape fields, and its larvae were observed to be important prey to carabid beetles. Therefore, we performed a laboratory experiment to detect whether rising temperature affects the number of pollen beetle larvae killed by five abundant carabids, and larval biomass ingested by carabids. In three climate chambers actual temperature (T1) was compared to temperatures increased by 3 degrees C (T2) and 5 degrees C (T3). This is the first study investigating the feeding of carabid predators on an arable pest insect spanning a realistic forecasted climate warming scenario of 3 and 5 degrees C, thus providing basic knowledge on that neglected research area. We hypothesized that carabids kill more pollen beetle larvae at rising temperature, and biomass intake by carabids increases with rising temperature.Results: Both beetle species and temperature had significant effects on the number of killed Meligethes larvae and larval biomass ingested by carabids. Amara ovata, Harpalus distinguendus and Poecilus cupreus killed significantly more pollen beetle larvae at T2 and T3 compared to T1. Anchomenus dorsalis killed significantly more larvae at T2 than T1, and Harpalus affinis showed no significant differences among temperatures. Biomass intake by A. ovata, H. distinguendus and A. dorsalis was significantly larger at T2 and T3 compared to T1. Biomass intake by H. affinis and P. cupreus did not significantly differ among temperatures. Among the five carabids tested P. cupreus exhibited the highest values for both number of killed larvae and biomass intake.Conclusions: Our lab results suggest a clear potential for higher feeding of pollen beetle larvae by carabid beetles at rising temperature. As rising temperature leads to increased activity of abundant arable carabids in the field, it may be expected that there is enhanced pest suppression under warmer field conditions.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8				1472-6785		WOS:000374458800001	27084775

ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY				153	1			63	71		10.1111/j.1744-7348.2008.00238.x				2008	2008	This study aimed to address the effect of temperature on the consumption and development rates of Aphidecta obliterata and to compare the responses of Ap. obliterata (specialist) with that of Adalia bipunctata (generalist) to prey limitation. Temperature had a significant and positive effect on the time to egg hatch of Ap. obliterata. The duration of the larval instars was not affected by prey species at 15 degrees C but was significantly shorter, 12.1 days at 20 degrees C compared with 21.1 days at 15 degrees C. The proportion of time spent in each instar, however, was not affected by temperature or prey species, but the duration of the pupal stage was significantly affected by temperature. The average daily consumption of prey aphids increased with instar and was significantly influenced by temperature. There was a significant difference in the length of the pupal stage between coccinellid species but not that of the larval stage. The duration of the larval period increased under conditions of prey shortage. The pupal period of Ap. obliterata was significantly affected by the food regime but not that of Ad. bipunctata. There was a significant interaction between species and food supply on the length of the pupal stage and the larval stage and the final fresh weight achieved by the newly emerged adults. Male adults weighed significantly less than the females in all regimes. Larvae of Ap. obliterata and Ad. bipunctata did not consume any of the alternative prey (Collembola or Psocoptera) provided. There was no significant difference in the consumption of prey between the two coccinellid species. The results suggest that both of these coccinellids are well adapted to low-density-specific prey. There were no obvious differences between the two, which would tend to favour either species in an environment of limited prey.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0003-4746	1744-7348		WOS:000258068900007

In this study, age-stage, two-sex life table parameters and predation rate of Typhlodromus bagdasarjani Wainstein & Arutunjan were determined on two-spotted spider mite reared on susceptible ('Isfahan') and resistant ('Neishabour') eggplant cultivars under laboratory conditions at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L:D) h. The means, variances, and standard errors of the life table and predation parameters were estimated using the bootstrap resampling procedure. The value of the intrinsic rate of increase (r) of this predator on the susceptible eggplant cultivar (0.1538 d(-1)) was significantly higher than that on the resistant one (0.1175 d(-1)). The value of the net reproductive rate (R-0) on the susceptible and resistant eggplant cultivars was 7.55 and 8.21 offspring, respectively. In addition, the mean generation time (T) was 12.97 and 17.75 d, respectively. The age-stage-specific predation rate (c(xj)) of all stages of the predator on the resistant eggplant cultivar was higher than that on the susceptible one. In addition, the value of net predation rate (C-0) on the susceptible and resistant eggplant cultivars was 193.05 and 221.44 preys per predator, respectively. In addition, the value of finite predation rate (omega) on the resistant cultivar (7.005 preys per predator per day) was significantly higher than that on the susceptible one (6.361 preys per predator per day). In conclusion, due to higher finite predation rate on the resistant eggplant cultivar, the performance of the predator on this cultivar was more than that on the susceptible one.									25	0	0	0	23	0	28			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000358537600007

In consumption experiments temperature, diet and their interaction all had significant effects on the ratio of larval weight to the weight of food consumed, which was higher at 24 degrees C than at any other temperature. In competition experiments, three relationships were examined and modeled: that between the number of larvae per experimental unit and the average weight of those larvae; that between average larval and adult weights; and that between average adult weight and survivorship to adult (emergence rate). An exponential decay function was fit to the relationship between number of larvae per experimental unit and their average weight. Average adult weight was linearly correlated with larval weight. Likewise, emergence rates for adults <11.6 mg in weight were linearly correlated with adult weights, but no significant relationship was observed for heavier adults. Using these relationships, the reproductive potential for A. tumida were estimated for a frame of honey and pollen. Information on resource acquisition by A. tumida will be useful in evaluating the impact of different factors on beetle population dynamics, such as bee hygienic behavior or control strategies used by the beekeeper.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000300506600004	22420251

Using this method, which enables accurate estimations of scale insect weight by measuring length and relating it to a previously determined regression model, maximum feeding potential in male and female Chilocorus nigritus (F.) adults was examined at various constant temperatures over the range of 13 to 30 degrees C and at a cycling temperature of 12 h/12 h at 14/30 degrees C (r.h. in the range of 62 to 68%). Mean daily potential food intake varied from 0.097 mg/day at 13 degrees C to 1.432 mg/day at 30 degrees C. However, intake at the cycling temperature was significantly higher than that at constant temperatures (1.98 mg/day). At 15, 20 and 30 degrees C there were no significant differences between male and female potential food requirements whilst at temperatures in the mid range, there was a considerable increase in female potential voracity when compared to that of the males. Maximum potential larval food requirement for development at 26 degrees C and 62% r.h. in C. nigritus was also estimated using the above method. A mean of 16.24 mg of Abgrallaspis cyanophylli (Signoret) was required for larvae of both sexes to complete development. This study suggests that C. nigritus would be most efficient as a biological control agent if used in glasshouses with a mean daily temperature above 22 degrees C.									10	0	0	0	9	1	10			1386-6141			WOS:000089336400004

(Hom., Aleyrodidae). Knowledge about its consumption of B. tabaci is incomplete. The present study was undertaken to determine the potential use of this predator in biological control programs. The daily and total prey consumption of S. parcesetosum through the entire development of the larval instars as well as during three different periods of longevity of adult females and males feeding on nymphs or puparia of B. labaci as prey was examined. In addition, the daily prey consumption of the adult females where the number of B. tabaci puparia was altered was studied at two different temperatures in the laboratory. The results showed that the mean daily prey consumption of nymphs or puparia of B. tabaci by larval instars of S. parcesetosum increased gradually as development progressed at both temperatures. Significant differences were found in the mean total prey consumption among the different predatory larval instars. In total, S. parcesetosum consumed during its entire larval development significantly more nymphs than puparia; at 18 degrees C it consumed a mean of 1,566.1 (female) and 1,443.9 (male) nymphs or 280.0 (female) and 250.8 (male) puparia, while at 30 degrees C, it consumed a mean of 1,119.1 (female) and 979.9 (male) nymphs or 188.2 (female) and 171.6 (male) puparia. Over the three studied periods of the adult stage of S. parcesetosum, the mean daily prey consumption by the females and males fluctuated irregularly at both temperatures. At 18 degrees C and 30 degrees C, both females and males consumed significantly more nymphs than puparia. No significant differences were found between females and males with respect to consumption of nymphs, although significant differences were found between the sexes with respect to consumption of puparia, but at 18 degrees C only. The mean total prey consumption over the three studied adult stages was 2,188.4 (female) and 1,994 (male) nymphs or 727.1 (female) and 624.8 (male) puparia at 18 degrees C, while at 30 degrees C the mean values were 3,947.7 (female) and 3,577.3 (male) nymphs or 1,600.5 (female) and 1,448.8 (male) puparia. S. parcesetosum adapted smoothly to fluctuating prey availability, where the mean daily prey consumption became higher when 50 puparia/day was offered. In contrast, the predator consumed most individuals when the number of prey supplied was 10 or 5 puparia/day. Prey consumption decreased during the second experimental week in the trial, before which 50 puparia/day had been offered. In the other trials, before which 20, 10 and 5 puparia/day had been offered, a considerable increase in prey consumption was noted.									14	0	0	0	17	0	18			1612-4758			WOS:000229970600012

Higher temperatures are expected to induce an increase in predation rates. However, little is known on how temperature influences close-range encounter of prey-predator interactions, such as predator's attack velocities. Based on the speed-accuracy trade-off concept, we hypothesized that the increase in predator attack velocity by increasing temperature reduces the accuracy of the attack, leading to a lower probability of capture. We tested this hypothesis on the dragonfly larvae Anax imperator and the zooplankton prey Daphnia magna. The prey-predator encounters were video-recorded at high speed, and at three different temperatures. Overall, we found that (1) temperature had a strong effect on predator's attack velocities, (2) prey did not have the opportunity to move and/or escape due to the high velocity of the predator during the attack, and (3) neither velocity nor temperature had significant effects on the capture success. By contrast, the capture success mainly depended on the accuracy of the predator in capturing the prey. We found that (4) some 40% of mistakes were undershooting and some 60% aimed below or above the target. No lateral mistake was observed. These results did not support the speed-accuracy trade-off hypothesis. Further studies on dragonfly larvae with different morphological labial masks and speeds of attacks, as well as on prey with different escape strategies, would provide new insights into the response to environmental changes in prey-predator interactions.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2045-7758			WOS:000430807200042	29721299

In laboratory experiments, P. bioculatus fed small prey exhibited greater capture success, increased survivorship, and faster development to adulthood than individuals fed large prey. An increase of potato beetle prey stage by one instar lowered capture success and survival by 82 and 80%, respectively. Although multiple P. bioculatus are commonly found feeding on a single prey in the field, laboratory survival rates, and development times did not differ significantly between Perillus bioculatus reared individually and in groups. P. bioculatus presented with two prey sizes most commonly attacked the instar that was easiest to capture and that maximized survival. In the absence of augmentative release programs, P. bioculatus is unable to regulate L. decemlineata populations. At the study site in Yakima, Washington, L. decemlineata completes one to three generations per year in potato fields, never reaching stable age distribution before the end of the growing season. Consequently, small, easily captured prey are present only episodically. Developing P. bioculatus must therefore feed on large prey during much of the growing season, limiting their capacity to grow and survive, which is hypothesized as one reason for their failure to regulate L. decemlineata populations. Typically, invulnerable prey stages stabilize predator-prey dynamics. The evidence presented here suggests that prey refuges can also destabilize predator-prey interactions by limiting the capacity of predators to numerically respond and to regulate prey populations.									8	0	0	0	9	1	9			0046-225X			WOS:000232405800010

However, the effects of an important trait-predator foraging strategy-are largely unknown. We investigated the interactions between predator foraging strategy and temperature on two ectotherm predators: an active predator, the backswimmerNotonecta undulata, and a sit-and-wait predator, the damselflyEnallagma annexum. In a series of predator-prey experiments across a temperature gradient, we measured predator feeding rates on an active prey species, zooplanktonDaphnia pulex, predator growth rates, and mechanisms that influence predator feeding: body speed of predators and prey (here measured as swimming speed), prey encounter rates, capture success, attack rates, and handling time. Overall, warming led to increased feeding rates for both predators through changes to each component of the predator's functional response. We found that prey swimming speed strongly increased with temperature. The active predator's swimming speed also increased with temperature, and together, the increase in predator and prey swimming speed resulted in twofold higher prey encounter rates for the active predator at warmer temperatures. By contrast, prey encounter rates of the sit-and-wait predator increased fourfold with rising temperatures as a result of increased prey swimming speed. Concurrently, increased prey swimming speed was associated with a decline in the active predator's capture success at high temperatures, whereas the sit-and-wait predator's capture success slightly increased with temperature. We provide some of the first evidence that foraging traits mediate the indirect effects of warming on predator performance. Understanding how traits influence species' responses to warming could clarify how climate change will affect entire functional groups of species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000562303400001	32726861

Although extensive research has been carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature on animal life histories and to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds as well as the optimal temperatures for survival, development, and reproduction, few studies have investigated links between thermal window, metabolism, and trophic interactions such as predation. We developed models and conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how temperature influences predator-prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional response) using a ladybeetle larva feeding on aphid prey. As predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology, we found that handling time exponentially decreases with warming, but-in contrast with this theory-search rate follows a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. An examination of the model reveals that temperature thresholds for predation depend mainly on search rate, suggesting that predation rate is primarily determined by searching activities and secondly by prey handling. In contrast with prior studies, our model shows that per capita short-term predator-prey interaction strengths and predator energetic efficiency (per capita feeding rate relative to metabolism) generally increase with temperature, reach an optimum, and then decrease at higher temperatures. We conclude that integrating the concept of thermal windows in short- and long-term ecological studies would lead to a better understanding of predator-prey population dynamics at thermal limits and allow better predictions of global warming effects on natural ecosystems.									64	1	0	0	61	0	65			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000306494800025	22271203

In aquatic systems, where gape-limited predators are common, abiotic factors that influence organisms' growth rates potentially mediate predator-prey interactions indirectly through effects on prey size. We tested the hypothesis that temperature influences interactions between aquatic size-limited insect predators (Notonecta kirbyi) and their larval anuran prey (Hyla regilla) beyond its indirect effect on prey size. Notonecta kirbyi and H. regilla were raised and tested in predator-prey trials at one of three experimentally maintained temperatures, 9.9, 20.7, or 25.7 degreesC. Temperature strongly influenced anuran growth and predator success; mean tadpole mass over time was positively related to temperature, while the number of prey caught was negatively related. At higher temperatures tadpoles attained greater mass more quickly, allowing them to avoid capture by notonectids. However, the probability of capture is a function of both mass and temperature; temperature was a significant explanatory variable in a logistic regression equation predicting prey capture. For a given prey mass, tadpoles raised in warmer water experienced a higher probability of capture by notonectids. Thus, rather than being static, prey size refugia are influenced directly by abiotic factors, in this case temperature. This suggests that temperature exerts differential effects on notonectid and larval anurans, leading to differences in the probability of prey capture for a given prey mass. Therefore, temperature can influence predator-prey interactions via indirect effects on prey size and direct effects on prey.									41	0	0	0	41	0	44			0008-4301			WOS:000172265900011

Results of experiments and model predictions clearly demonstrate selective predation of backswimmers when fed with a choice of daphnid size classes, with patterns of selectivity differing across N. maculata instars. The model describes the foraging process empirically on the base of a general predation cycle including four conditional events instead of using classic functional response curves. For model parameterisation components of predation, namely probability of encounter, attack and success as well as time spent on handling prey was directly observed by means of video tracking experiments. Since attack rate, capture success and handling time appeared to be a function of prey size differing between Notonecta instars, the model takes into account ontogenic changes in both predator and prey characteristics. Independent data of functional response and size selectivity experiments were used for model validation and proved the model outcome to be consistent with observations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A type II functional response was obtained at all temperatures tested (5-25 degrees C). Handling time was negatively correlated with temperature across the entire range investigated; attack rate increased with temperature to a maximum at 20 degrees C. The relationships between temperature and prey density and the behavioural subcomponents of attack rate were also investigated. Encounter rates with individual prey were significantly greater at law prey densities and high temperatures. The frequency of reactive encounters was significantly greater at higher temperatures but was unrelated to prey density; a similar trend was apparent for attack frequency.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			1326-6756			WOS:000077514100005

This study examined the effect of temperature on the functional response of anacarophagous thrips Scolothrips longicornis Priesner to different densities of two spotted spider mite, Tetranychusurticae Koch in laboratory conditions. Five constant temperatures (15, 20, 26, 30, and 35 Â°C) and sevenprey densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) were used in the experiments. At each temperature, 2 to 128 adultof T. urticaue were exposed to a female S. longicornis for a 24 h period. The results indicated that thepredatory thrips exhibited type II functional response to different densities of T. urticae at all examinedtemperatures. Temperature had significant effect on the predation capacity of the adult thrips over the rangeof 15–35 Â°C. Instantaneous attack rate (a) of the predator increased linearly with increasing temperature from15 to 35 Â°C. At 35 Â°C, the highest instantaneous attack rate was estimated to be 0.0579 day1 using the Hollingmodel and 0.1480 day1 using Rogers model. The estimated value of handling time (Th) using both Hollingand Rogers models decreased linearly with increasing temperature from 15 to 35 Â°C. Scolothrips longicornisachieved higher predation at higher temperature (16.1 preys/day at 35 Â°C). This observation suggested that S.longicornis may be more effective for biological control of two spotted spider mite in warmer conditions.									19	4	0	0	21	1	26			1226-8615			KJD:ART001321212

Recent studies focusing on the consequences of environmental change on species interactions highlighted the need for a wider, multi-species context including both trophic and non-trophic interactions (e.g. predator interference). However, the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on trophic and non-trophic interactions remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we combined laboratory experiments and functional response modelling to investigate how temperature and prey density influence trophic and non-trophic interactions in multiple predator communities. The system under study consisted of predatory dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea) and omnivorous marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) preying on common carp fry (Cyprinus carpio). We estimated the functional response of each predator in single-predator experiments and used this information to disentangle the trophic and non-trophic interactions and their dependence on environmental conditions in multiple predator trials. We found that consumer identity, prey density, and temperature all affect the magnitude of trophic and non-trophic interactions. Non-trophic interactions mostly decreased predator feeding rates, corroborating previous observations that interference prevails in aquatic communities. Moreover, trophic interactions depended primarily on the environmental variables whereas non-trophic interactions depended mainly on consumer identity. Our results indicate that non-trophic interactions among true predators and omnivores can be substantial and that biotic and abiotic conditions further modify the magnitude and direction of these interactions, which can affect food web dynamics and stability.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000490904700008

(Coleoptera:Coccinellidae)								PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				42	4			461	466						AUG 2010	2010	The foraging activities of the predators depend, on environmental variables, including air temperature. In the present study, the searching behavior and maximum consumption of prey of all developmental stages of Coccinella septempunctata was carried out with respect to the changing values of the air temperature. A strong relationship between two important factors of functional response "instantaneous attack rate" (a') and "prey handling time" (T-h) was found with respect to temperature changes. The prey intake ratio per unit time was increased with increasing temperature up to a certain level beyond which it levels off and goes down to the extent of '0'predation. The temperature range for the foraging activities falls between 10 degrees C-40 degrees C. However, maximum predation rates were observed between 20-23 degrees C and 23 degrees C-25 degrees C. The lower temperature where the foraging activities were completely ceased was between 10-12 degrees C irrespective of prey densities available. A parabolic (curvilinear) relationship with high scale of co-relation (r(2) (=) 0.86-0.99 alpha = 0.01) (T-h) was found.									7	1	0	0	8	0	8			0030-9923			WOS:000278433800016

Variation in the strength of predator-prey interactions often can be attributed to predator mass and prey mass, or abiotic factors like temperature. However, even when accounting for these factors, there remains a considerable amount of unexplained variation that may be attributed to other traits. We compiled functional response data from the literature to investigate how predator mass, prey mass, prey type (taxonomic identity), temperature, and prey defenses (hard vs soft integument) contributed to the variation found in the predator-prey interactions between freshwater cyclopoid copepods and their prey. Surprisingly, our results indicate that prey identity (taxonomic group) and defenses (hard vs soft integument) are more important for generating variation in interaction strengths than body mass and temperature. This suggests that allometric functions can only take us so far when attempting to better understand variation in individual predator prey interactions, and that we must evaluate how other traits influence interaction strengths. Identifying additional factors such as prey defenses may enable us to better predict potential changes in the structure and function of planktonic and other food webs by better accounting for the variation in the interactions between generalists and their many prey types.									30	1	0	0	28	0	29			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000368829300022	26552379

Recent studies have used the equation of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) to quantify the effect of temperature on the parameter Th, called handling time, and then predict the responses of predators and communities to climate change. However, our understanding of the processes behind Th and how they vary with temperature remains limited. Using a ladybeetle-aphid system, we compared estimates of Th to direct observations of handling time across a temperature gradient. We found estimated Th values to be greater than observed Th values, suggesting that predation rate is not limited by the time available for handling prey. We next estimated the corrected digestion time, i.e., digestion time corrected for gut capacity, by subtracting observed to estimated Th values. We finally plotted the relationships between temperature and handling or digestion rates. As predicted by MTE, the corrected digestion rate increased exponentially with warming whereas, in contrast to MTE prediction, the relationship between handling rate and temperature was hump shaped. The parameter Th is thus confusing because it combines handling and digestive processes that have different thermal responses. This may explain why general patterns in the relationship between Th and temperature have been difficult to identify in previous studies.									24	0	0	0	24	0	24			0012-9658			WOS:000322336600002	24015511

Predation rate, type of functional response, attack rate (a'), handling time (T-h), and maximum predation rate (T/T-h) of the predator were estimated using seven prey densities and three thermal conditions. The functional response of E. annulipes to P. xylostella was temperature-dependent, type III under the lower temperatur (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), and type II at 32 degrees C. We observed increasing values of a' in 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, decreasing values of Th and highest T/T-h as the thermal condition increased. Our findings suggest that E. annulipes could be effective to control P. xylostella under different thermal conditions, however its predation behavior changes according to temperature variation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000579864500008	33077112

The experiment was carried out in replicated aquatic microcosms with two different water temperatures (control and a 'warming water' scenario). Survival of tadpoles decreased significantly in the treatment compared to the control and at the end of the experiment, all tadpoles in the 'warming water' scenario had been ingested, unlike in the control treatment, where only half of the tadpoles were ingested. Our results demonstrate that the alterations in abiotic conditions (water temperature) can reshape predator-prey dynamics in a future scenario of global warming. The consequent increase of predation may intensify negative effects on population size in anuran larvae. Although changes are likely, they are complex and often counterintuitive.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0165-0521	1744-5140		WOS:000483734600001

The functional response of the adult, third and fourth larval instars ofO. conglobata contaminatafed on the common pistachio psylla,A. pistaciae, was studied at 22 degrees and 25 degrees C (65 +/- 5%RH and 16 L: 8D). Different psylla densities of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 were used. The data were fitted a type II functional response in all the stages. There was a significant difference in the attack rate and handling time of the predator in all stages at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The maximum attack rate (T/T-h) occurred at 25 degrees C.The lowest and highest attack rates were 0.046 and 0.154 for adult of the predator at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The handling time decreased significantly as the temperature increased from 22 degrees C to 25 degrees C in all treatments. The results suggest that the efficiency of theOenopia conglobatato control the pistachio psylla is high at 25 degrees C. On the other hand, the predatory beetleO. conglobata contaminatareacted to increasing temperature by enhanced search rate and activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-7584	1742-7592		WOS:000564920300015		
J	Vincent, Shawn E.; Mori, Akira								Determinants of feeding performance in free-ranging pit-vipers (Viperidae : Ovophis okinavensis): key roles for head size and body temperature								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				93	1			53	62						JAN 2008	2008	Feeding performance (handling time, capture success) in numerous animal species is well known to be influenced by a variety of ecological, functional, and physiological factors. Nonetheless, few studies have tested which factors are the strongest determinants of animal feeding performance in the wild. Using a field-based experiment, we examined the relationships among a number of functionally important variables and the predatory behaviour of free-ranging pit-vipers (Ovophis okinavensis) from Okinawa Island, Japan. Our main findings were: (1) strike latency was negatively related to snake body temperature and, hence, hotter snakes struck at frogs more readily than colder snakes; (2) initial bite position was correlated with ingestion direction (headfirst versus hindfirst) but ingestion direction was not correlated with ingestion duration; and (3) both snake head length and body temperature were negatively related with ingestion duration and, thus, snakes with longer heads and higher body temperatures had shorter ingestion durations. In O. okinavensis, head size and body temperature are therefore likely to have direct ecological consequences in terms of its feeding rate on explosively breeding frogs. More generally, however, this field-based study adds to the growing body of literature demonstrating that temperature has a pervasive influence on the feeding performance of ectotherms in general.

We monitored insect activity by videotaping pitchers and analyzing videotapes for several variables including identity of each visitor and outcome of each visit (e.g., departure or capture). Efficiency of capture (i.e., number of captures per number of visits) was low. Overall efficiency of capture was 0.83-0.93%, depending on whether potential prey were broadly or narrowly defined. Ants constituted 74% of the potential prey. Efficiency of capture of ants was even lower at 0.37%. Potential prey were more likely to visit pitchers with greater red venation and less water in the pitcher. There was no correlation between number of potential prey visiting a pitcher and pitcher age, length, or mouth width. Also, number of potential prey visits did not correlate with plant size, air temperature, time of day or date of videotaping. While the overall efficiency of prey capture was very low, pitcher plants may still benefit from the additional nutrients. However, the relationship between ants and S. purpurea remains an enigma, since it is unclear whether the plants capture enough ants to compensate for nectar lost to ants.									45	1	0	0	37	0	46			0002-9122			WOS:000071684600012	21684883

Both number of failures and handling time decreased significantly at higher T(b)S, and capture success was much higher for wingless flies; in fact, low T(b)S were associated with a significant increase in capture success only in the case of winged flies. At low T(b)S, winged flies could be efficiently seized by lizards only if pursued from a short distance. The attack distance was therefore larger for the less mobile (and less detectable) wingless flies at low T(b)S, which suggests a trade-off between attack distance and capture success under conditions of impaired locomotor performance. Results of this study show that the escape abilities of prey are crucial to evaluate the effects of temperature on the performance of reptiles as predators.									15	1	0	0	15	0	16			0268-0130			WOS:A1994PQ22300005		
J	Tangkawanit, Ubon; Hinmo, Nonglak; Khlibsuwan, Wirote								Role of different habitats for the functional response of Crytorrhinus lividipennis (Hemiptera: Miridae) on Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae)								BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				28	7			663	671		10.1080/09583157.2018.1477116				2018	2018	The functional response of a predator, Cyrtorrhinus lividipennis, on the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, was investigated in two different experimental habitats: a piece of tiller in a petri dish (5.5cm in diameter) and a rice plant in a net cage (5.5cm diameterx43cm height) for 24h at room temperature. In the petri dish experiment, 2nd-5th instar nymphs, adult male, and female C.lividipennis were introduced in separate experiments to eggs of N.lugens at densities of five, 10, 20, 30, and 40 eggs per piece of rice. In the rice plant experiment, each C.lividipennis was introduced to a cage with a rice plant containing N.lugens eggs. After 24h, the number of dead eggs and remaining eggs were counted and data fitted to three functional response models. Among the three types of functional responses, Type II best described the predator response to host densities in N.lugens in both experimental habitats, according to the logistic regression analysis value. The results showed that C.lividipennis was a more effective predator in the rice plant experiment compared to the disc experiment. Additionally, the searching efficiency and handling time parameters were different in the two different experimental habitats. This may cause errors when applying the functional response to biological control and predator-prey models. Different habitats and other environmental conditions from the experiment and natural rice field have to be considered.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000437197900003

(Homoptera : Delphacidae)								RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY				39	2			201	206		10.1007/BF02765266				DEC 1997	1997	The functional response of Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter attacking the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stal.), BPH) eggs on rice was determined at six constant temperatures of 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 29 degrees C, 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Rogers' (1972) random predator equations were fitted to the data for each temperature separately. The equation model adequately described a Holling's Type II functional response for C. lividipennis and produced biologically realistic estimates of attack rates and handling times at five experimental temperatures between 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C. However, at 35 degrees C, a negative handling time (Th = -0.0029) was produced. The effect of temperature was incorporated into Rogers' equation by making the attack rate (a) and handling time (Th) functions of temperature within the range 20 degrees C to 32 degrees C. The attack rate and handling time were fitted as hyperbola and reciprocal hyperbola functions of temperature respectively. The temperature incorporating four-parameter composite model fitted the combined data as well as did separate Rogers' equations based on the parameter estimates.									15	3	0	0	15	0	17			0034-5466			WOS:000073655900012

PREDPREY is a state-variable model that uses a distributed-delay function to represent temperature-dependent development of both predator and prey species. The predator submodel includes descriptions of immigration, predator search, functional response, survivorship, and reproductive characteristics. The prey submodel includes descriptions of immigration, survivorship, and reproductive characteristics. The plant model describes plant growth as a function of leaf area accumulation over time. The model tracks changes in predator and prey populations over a single growing season using a 1-day time step. The model captures the essence of predator-prey dynamics to provide reasonable predictions of population patterns. Comparison of the no-predator scenario to the standard simulation (1000 predators/ha) indicates that predators bring about a 24% reduction in peak prey (larval) density and a 47% reduction in overwintering prey (adult) numbers. Sensitivity analyses indicate that reproductive and survivorship characteristics of the prey have a relatively large impact on pest density. Among predator characteristics, developmental rate and most reproductive parameters have a greater impact than do search parameters and survivorship. Plant growth rate has a greater impact than the initial size of plants. The model can be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness of natural enemies, investigate augmentative biological control strategies, and evaluate biological control strategies as part of larger IPM programs.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was examined in petri dish arenas containing sweet pepper leaves infested with different densities of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The predator showed a type II functional response at three tested temperatures ranging from 19A degrees C to 27A degrees C. The theoretical maximum number of prey captured by the predator increased with temperature. Based on the random predator equation, the estimated attack rates ranged from 0.13 h(-1) at 19A degrees C to 0.35 h(-1) at 27A degrees C on a leaf area of 20-25 cm(2). There was no significant difference between the attack rates of the predator at 23A degrees C and 27A degrees C. Handling time significantly decreased as temperature increased from 19A degrees C (0.39 h) to 27A degrees C (0.24 h). This study shows that A. bipunctata displays high predation rates on M. persicae for a wide range of temperatures, indicating its potential for augmentative releases against this aphid pest. The limitations of the predictions generated by functional response experiments are discussed.									54	5	0	0	52	0	60			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000275536500006

The abiotic features of their microhabitat play a significant role in their foraging success, and trap relocation can be costly and risky. Wormlions are fly larvae that construct pits in loose soil to catch prey that fall into their pit-traps and serve as a fine example of a trap-building predator. Wormlions flourish in cities and often occur under buildings that provide shelter from direct sunlight and rain. Here, we studied in the laboratory and in the field the effect of simulated rain and soil moisture on wormlion (Vermileo sp.) habitat choice, response to prey and prey escape success. Wet soil had a strong negative effect on the wormlion pit size and its response to prey, and a positive effect on the probability of ant prey escaping the pit-trap. All these limitations led to a strong avoidance by wormlions of wet soil both before and after a pit was constructed, even at the cost of pit relocation. A field experiment comparing wet and dry plots nevertheless failed to show the expected directional relocation from wet to dry plots, and we provide several explanations as to why the patterns detected in the laboratory were less clear in the field. We suggest that rain presents a considerable limiting factor for wormlion hunting success, and that rain-shielding artificial structures could be responsible for the success of these predators in urban environments. It remains to be tested whether our results hold true for other trap-building predators and whether their preference for dry habitats is as strong as that of wormlions.

Orius sauteri (Poppius) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) is an important predator in northern China of many aphid species, including Aphis craccivora (Koch) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). We measured the functional response and intraspecific competition of O. sauteri under different densities of A. craccivora at several constant temperatures. Predation of O. sauteri on A. craccivora conformed to Holling's type II functional response at all temperatures tested. The predation capability of O. sauteri showed a significant correlation with temperature. The predation capacity of O. sauteri was highest at 25 degrees C, at which temperature we found the highest instantaneous attack rate (a = 0.8711), the theoretical maximum number of aphids captured (181.36), and the shortest handling time (T-h = 0.0055). Predation by O. sauteri increased progressively with temperature from 15 to 25 degrees C, but then decreased at 30 degrees C. Intraspecific competition of O. sauteri increased positively with predator density under all temperatures examined. Our results indicate O. sauteri has significant potential for use as a biocontrol agent, under a wide range of temperatures. The inverse density-dependent predation and intraspecific competition of O. sauteri suggests that to obtain the greatest degree of pest suppression, releases of O. sauteri should begin early in the cropping season and numbers released should take prey density into consideration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000456943800013	30169862

Temperature-dependent effects on predator-prey interactions are a major mechanism through which these effects occur. To understand the net effects of predator attack rates and dynamic windows of prey vulnerability, we examined the impacts of temperature on the interaction of a caterpillar (Arctia virginalis) and its ant predator (Formica lasioides). We conducted field experiments to examine attack rates on caterpillars relative to temperature, ant abundance, and body size, and laboratory experiments to determine the effects of temperature on caterpillar growth. We modeled temperature-dependent survival based on the integrated effects of temperature-dependent growth and temperature- and size-dependent predation. Attack rates on caterpillars increased with warming and ant recruitment, but decreased with caterpillar size. Caterpillar growth rates increased with temperature, narrowing the window of vulnerability. The model predicted that net caterpillar survival would decrease with temperature, suggesting that A. virginalis populations could be depressed with future climate warming. Theoretical work suggests that the net outcome of predator-prey interactions with increasing temperature depends on the respective responses of interacting species in terms of velocity across space, whereas the present study suggests the importance of effects of temperature on prey window of vulnerability, or "velocity" across time.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000436869900008	29672837

This study evaluated the functional response of three larval instars of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), preying upon eggs and first instar larvae of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner. The first and second instar larvae of C. carnea exhibited type II functional responses against both prey stages. However, the third instar larvae of C. carnea showed a type II functional response to the first instar larvae of H. armigera, but a type III functional response to the eggs. For the first instar larvae of C. carnea, the attack rate on H. armigera eggs was significantly higher than that on the larvae, whereas the attack rate of the second instar C. carnea on H. armigera larvae was significantly higher than that on the eggs. For the third instar larvae of C. carnea, the attack rate on the larvae was 1.015 +/- 0.278/h, and the attack coefficient on the eggs was 0.036 +/- 0.005. The handling times of the third instar larvae on larvae and eggs were 0.087 +/- 0.009 and 0.071 +/- 0.001 h, respectively. The highest predation rate was found for the third instar larvae of C. carnea on H. armigera eggs. Results of this study revealed that the larvae of C. carnea, especially the third instar, had a good predation potential in controlling H. armigera eggs and larvae. However, for a comprehensive estimation of the bio-control abilities of C. carnea toward H. armigera, further field-based studies are needed.									28	0	0	0	24	0	28			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000288863900010

These interactions can change with warming, depending on the foraging mode of the predator. Theory predicts that warming increases foraging velocity in ectotherms, but in a sit-and-wait predator that has zero velocity when foraging, the interaction strength should be temperature independent. Using the protist Urocentrum turbo and the sit-and-wait copepod Orthocyclops modestus, we tested this prediction by measuring dynamic interaction strengths (effect of a predator on prey population growth rate) and by estimating the parameters of a functional response. Both of these metrics were consistent with the prediction that interaction strength is temperature independent in a sit-and-wait predator. Our results indicate that there may be considerable variability in how warming alters foraging interactions, and estimating the overall effects of climate change on food webs may require consideration of the distribution of foraging strategies and the potential asymmetries that arise with interactions that involve different strategies.									15	1	0	0	15	1	16			2150-8925			WOS:000345097200015

The test system consists of the predacious mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer Canestrini) and, as prey, the collembolan Folsomia fimetaria L. in a microcosm (5.5 cm high x 6.0 cm in diameter) with 30 g humidified soil. F. fimetaria is provided with bakers yeast as food source. The model simulates (i) the population development of the test animals in synchronous cultures before the test, (ii) the selection of the test animals from the synchronous cultures and (iii) predator-prey interactions with and without the presence of dimethoate during the test and extraction periods. The driving variable is the temperature dependent food demands of the organisms. Both species were simulated with separate male and female populations, which were divided into a number of life stages. Thus the model handles very complicated predator-prey interactions taking the different interactions between different instars into consideration. The simulated test results were found to be very sensitive to changes in predator search rate, capture efficiency, habitat overlap, the amount of stored reserves of H. aculeifer at test start and the survival and reproduction of F. fimetaria, The simulations constitute the foundation for suggestions for further improvement of the test system.

JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY				204	3			295	303		10.1007/s00359-017-1239-8				MAR 2018	2018	Rattlesnakes use infrared radiation to detect prey animals such as small mammals and lizards. Because ectotherm locomotor performance depends on temperature, rattlesnakes could use prey temperature to evaluate the potential of lizards to evade attacks. Here, we tested whether hunting rattlesnakes use infrared information to (1) detect and (2) evaluate prey before attack. We expected thermal contrast between prey and background to be the best predictor of predatory behaviour under the prey detection hypothesis, and absolute prey temperature under the prey evaluation hypothesis. We presented lizard carcasses of varying temperatures to free-ranging sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) and scored behavioural responses as a function of thermal contrast, absolute lizard temperature, and light level. Thermal contrast and light level were the most salient predictors of snake behaviour. Snakes were more likely to respond to lizards and/or respond at greater distances at night and when thermal contrast was high, supporting the known prey detection function of infrared sensing. Absolute lizard temperature was not an important predictor of snake behaviour; thus, we found no evidence for temperature-based prey evaluation. Infrared sensing is still poorly understood in ecologically relevant contexts; future research will test whether rattlesnakes learn to evaluate prey based on temperature with experience.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0340-7594	1432-1351		WOS:000425333200004	29218413

J	Cairns, David K.; Gaston, Anthony J.; Huettmann, Falk								Endothermy, ectothermy and the global structure of marine vertebrate communities								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				356				239	250		10.3354/meps07286				2008	2008	Birds and mammals are the leading marine predators at high latitudes, while sharks and other large fish occupy top positions in tropical waters. The present study proposes that temperature-dependent predation success (TPS) explains global patterns of marine vertebrate community structure. Burst speed increases with temperature in ectotherms but is independent of temperature in endotherms. If capture success depends on relative swimming speeds of predator and prey, ectothermic prey will be more vulnerable to attack by endothermic predators at low temperatures. Conversely, high temperatures should enhance the ability of ectothermic predators to prey on endotherms. Pursuit-diving seabirds (penguins, auks and some cormorants) and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) are ubiquitous in ocean waters with summer surface temperatures cooler than the mid-teens to low 20s (degrees C) but are virtually absent in warmer regions. We suggest that the near-absence of these animals at low latitudes is due to TPS, as warm water increases the difficulty of capturing fish prey and increases vulnerability to predation by large ectothermic and partially endothermic sharks. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are virtually absent from warm temperate and tropical waters, even where primary productivity and fisheries data suggest that food supplies are ample. This indicates that the low productivity that prevails in much of the tropical zone cannot explain the worldwide distributional patterns of pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds. Endothermy in marine communities increases with cooler temperatures and with animal size. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are sensitive to temperature limits and may suffer important range contractions as oceans warm.									29	0	0	0	29	0	33			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000254963900020		
J	Chejanovski, Zachary A.; Kolbe, Jason J.								Close encounters of the urban kind: predators influence prey body size variation in an urban landscape								EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY				33	6			791	809		10.1007/s10682-019-10008-1				DEC 2019	2019	Body size is a key trait linked to many aspects of an organism's life history, physiology, and behavior. Variation in body size can thus have important fitness consequences across a broad range of ecological contexts. We utilized the variation in multiple abiotic and biotic factors found among urban habitats to test simultaneously their relative effects on body size variation in urban populations of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei). These factors represent major hypotheses regarding body size variation in ectotherms and other animal groups: temperature, food availability, conspecific abundance and predator abundance. We also performed a tethered intruder experiment to determine whether the attack behavior of predatory curly-tailed lizards (Leiocephalus carinatus) depends on the body size of their brown anole prey. Lastly, we conducted a common garden experiment to assess whether brown anole body size differences between sites with and without curly-tailed lizard predators are genetically based. Predator abundance was the primary predictor of brown anole body size for both males and females. No other hypotheses were consistently supported. Brown anole body size increased along with increasing predator abundance, and predator abundance was negatively related to body size variation. Additionally, predators approached larger brown anoles less often and at longer latencies compared to smaller ones. Finally, male brown anoles from sites with predators had faster growth rates compared to those from sites without predators under common conditions in the lab. Brown anole body size differences among populations may result from higher survival of larger lizards during predatory confrontations, and this trait is at least partially heritable in males. Therefore, our results suggest that curly-tailed lizard predators may be important agents of evolution by natural selection for brown anole populations in urban habitats. To further investigate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of predator-prey interactions in urban habitats, future research should focus on measuring predator-induced selection in these novel environments.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0269-7653	1573-8477		WOS:000495301800003		
J	Ferris, Rebecca; Wilson, Robbie S.

However, few studies have examined acclimation responses in the context of the organism's ecology: namely, considering interactions among different species. In this study, we investigated the acclimation responses of three species of aquatic organisms from the same environment that simultaneously interact across different seasons. We predicted that the crimson spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi) and the freshwater shrimp (Paratya australiensis), which are involved in a predator-prey relationship, would exhibit similar thermal acclimation responses due to an arms race in physiological responses. In contrast, we expected that the backswimmer (Enithares sp.) species from the same environment, which is not commonly preyed upon due to their hard chitinous exterior, would display a limited acclimation response. We found that acute increases in temperature resulted in improved locomotor performance for all three species and an improved prey capture performance for M. duboulayi. Acclimation to 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C for 6 weeks did not affect the prey-capture performance of M. duboulayi or the locomotor performance of either M. duboulayi or Enithares sp. However, acclimation to cool temperatures improved the locomotor performance of P. australiensis at both cool and warm temperatures. Thus, the interaction between M. duboulayi (predator) and P. australiensis (prey) is likely to change across seasons via differences in acclimation responses, which could directly affect their behavioural strategies and population dynamics.

Critical attributes of assessment include quantifying predator's attack rate (a) and handling time (T-h). The maximum attack rate (T/T-h) (i.e. the maximum number of prey that can be attacked by a predator during the time interval (T) considered) could be a more precise and interpretable indicator of the potential suppression of pests exerted by a predator; however, its calculation only provides a point estimator usually derived from incomplete datasets (e.g. unbalanced or low replicated experimental designs) that could lead to draw wrong conclusions. We introduce simaR (simulation of maximum attack rates using R), an R library that generates 95% confidence intervals around estimates of the maximum attack rate that can be easily and intuitively used to compare across species. We validated the simulation method and used the empirical results of a controlled laboratory experiment to compare the maximum attack rates of spiders across a range of Medfly prey densities and illustrate how to use simaR with non-replicated partial data. Applying our method we found a significant effect of temperature on the maximum attack rate of two different guilds of spiders, the orb-weaver A. cucurbitina and the ambusher S. globosum that was not relevant regarding their attack rate and handling time. Our method compares different predator species and/or experimental conditions in a simple and reproducible procedure through an accurate, easy-to-use, fast and statistically robust analysis, based on simulation and bootstrapping, that can be used to assess the pest suppression potential of predators by simulating their functional responses from low-effort laboratory trials.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000434384500011

However, an animal's appearance might also evolve in response to the abiotic environment. Here, we investigate the processes that determine the appearance of silk webbing built by New Zealand's largest endemic moth Aenetus virescens (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae), whose larvae burrow into the trunks of native trees. Larvae cover tunnel entrances with silk webbing, detritus, and epiphytes, giving them a similar appearance to tree bark. First, we conducted spectral analyses of webbing and background bark in avian tetrahedral color space to test whether webbing made larvae less visible to predatory parrots. Next, we manipulated the spectral contrast of webbing and background bark and assessed its effect on predation by parrots for over 2 yr. Last, we measured the effect of webbing on tunnel temperatures and quantified how temperatures within tunnels affected larval growth. Results indicate that webbing made larvae less visible to predatory parrots. However, webbing contrast to background bark did not affect predation by parrots. Instead, webbing increased temperatures within tunnels and facilitated more rapid larval growth. Overall results indicate that the appearance of organisms that are difficult to locate visually may not always result from selection by predators.									3	0	0	0	4	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000400598500012	28247920	
J	Kruse, Peter Dalgas; Toft, Soren; Sunderland, Keith D.								Temperature and prey capture: opposite relationships in two predator taxa								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				33	2			305	312		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00978.x				APR 2008	2008	1. All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey.2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey.3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C).4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons. The ability of many carabid beetles to forage at low temperatures may have nutritional benefits and increases the diversity of interactions in terrestrial food webs.									41	0	0	0	40	0	41			0307-6946			WOS:000253710000019

Copper and temperature modulate predator-prey interactions in larval dragonflies and anurans								ECOSPHERE				6	4					56	10.1890/ES14-00461.1				APR 2015	2015	Amphibians are important indicators of environmental health, and their populations are in worldwide decline. The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 mu g Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22 degrees C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17 degrees C). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments. We suggest that increased concentrations of dissolved copper and elevated water temperatures are harmful to amphibian prey through maladaptive behavioral responses in the presence of predators.									20	0	1	0	21	0	22			2150-8925			WOS:000354777300011

Therefore, bats and insects were sampled from various agroecosystems using mist netting and light trapping techniques. A generalized linear model was then employed to analyze some biotic and abiotic factors' effects on insect and insectivorous bat activities. The results indicate that agroecosystems and lunar cycles have significant effects on insect activity (Lepidopteran, Dipteran, and total insect activity) and insectivorous bat activity (Hipposideros jonesi, Hipposideros aff. ruber, and overall insectivorous bat activity). Generally, inorganic farms recorded the least insect and insectivorous bat activity, while fallow lands and teak plantations obtained higher levels of activity for all analyses. In addition, our findings suggest that activity levels of both insects and insectivorous bats follow a lunar cycle. While the effect of temperature (overall insect activity, P = 0.7474; overall insectivorous bat activity, P = 0.7310) was not significant, wind speed (P = 0.0102) had a significantly negative relationship with total insectivorous bat activity. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between total insect and insectivorous bat activity (P = 0.0190). This study emphasizes the negative effects of agricultural intensification on insectivorous bat and insect activities, and thus indicates the importance of fallow lands and woodlots for conservation.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1300-0179	1303-6114		WOS:000373706200018

Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we addressed how 4 degrees C warming and exposure to the pesticide endosulfan shape the predation on Culex pipiens mosquitoes by damselfly predators from replicated low-and high-latitude populations. Although warming was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates on these prey. Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes. Our results suggest that predation rates on mosquitoes at the high latitude will be reduced under warming unless predators evolve toward the current low-latitude phenotype or low-latitude predators move poleward.									16	1	0	0	15	0	16			1752-4571			WOS:000379931900007	27330557

In both species, predation capacity was a function of temperature and prey density: more prey were captured as temperature and number of prey offered increased. Results indicated that type II and III functional responses provided the best fit to the data obtained for P. nigrispinus at 18 and 23 degreesC, and at 27 degreesC, respectively. However, the data for P. maculiventris showed a better fit to type II at 18 degreesC and to type III at higher temperatures. Tn both pentatomids the handling time decreased with increasing temperature. At higher temperatures, P. nigrispinus demonstrated greater predation rates than P. maculiventris. The implications of these findings for the control of caterpillar pests in glasshouses are discussed.									81	12	0	0	92	5	108			0931-2048			WOS:000168945500006

Controlled stimulation revealed that they can trigger APs for deflections >2.9 degrees, angular velocities >3.4 degrees s(-1) and forces >29 mu N. Hairs became desensitized and subsequently responded to fast consecutive stimulations; desensitization increased at lower temperatures. Recording of ant trigger hair contact events revealed that even small insects exceed the hairs' sensitivity threshold.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2055-026X	2055-0278		WOS:000474454600012	31285557

Logistic regression indicated a type II functional response on all plants. The maximum number of prey killed per day by females was 65.4 at a density of 130 preys on sweet pepper. On the other hand, handling time was significantly longer on tomato than on eggplant or sweet pepper (0.35h vs. 0.24h and 0.21h, respectively).

The lower temperature threshold for Anyphaena was -3.7 degrees C, while that of Philodromus was -1.2 degrees C. At 1 degrees C the latency to capture and prey consumption was significantly shorter in Anyphaena than in Philodromus. The capture rate increased with temperature and was maximal at 15 degrees C in Anyphaena and at 30 degrees C in Philodromus.

J	Cuthbert, Ross N.; Dick, Jaimie T. A.; Callaghan, Amanda								Interspecific variation, habitat complexity and ovipositional responses modulate the efficacy of cyclopoid copepods in disease vector control								BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				121				80	87		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.02.012				JUN 2018	2018	The use of predatory biological control agents can form an effective component in the management of vectors of parasitic diseases and arboviruses. However, we require predictive methods to assess the efficacies of potential biocontrol agents under relevant environmental contexts. Here, we applied functional responses (FRs) and reproductive effort as a proxy of numerical responses (NRs) to compare the Relative Control Potential (RCP) of three cyclopoid copepods, Macrocyclops albidus, M. fuscus and Megacyclops viridis towards larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. The effects of habitat complexity on such predatory impacts were examined, as well as ovipositional responses of C. quinquefasciatus to copepod cues in pairwise choice tests. All three copepod species demonstrated a population destabilising Type II FR. M. albidus demonstrated the shortest handling time and highest maximum feeding rate, whilst M. fuscus exhibited the highest attack rate. The integration of reproductive effort estimations in the new RCP metric identifies M. albidus as a very promising biocontrol agent. Habitat complexity did not impact the FR form or maximum feeding rate of M. albidus, indicating that potentially population destabilising effects are robust to habitat variations; however, attack rates of M. albidus were reduced in the presence of such complexity. C. quinquefasciatus avoided ovipositing where M. albidus was physically present, however it did not avoid chemical cues alone. C. quinquefasciatus continued to avoid M. albidus during oviposition when both the treatment and control water were dyed; however, when an undyed, predator-free control was paired with dyed, predator-treated water, positive selectivity towards the treatment water was stimulated. We thus demonstrate the marked predatory potential of cyclopoid copepods, utilising our new RCP metric, and advocate their feasibility in biological control programmes targeting container-style habitats. We also show that behavioural responses of target organisms and environmental context should be considered to maximise agent efficacy.									24	0	0	0	22	0	24			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000429777100012

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), it is important to understand predator-prey interactions. Hence, the voracity and functional response of 4th instar larvae and adults (males and females) of C undecimpunctata L. on Myzus persicae Sulzer were evaluated under laboratory conditions. This study took place in small plastic boxes at varying aphid densities. Satiation was attained when 130 aphids were provided to 4th instar larvae and 90 to adult males or females. Coccinella undecimpunctata exhibited a type II functional response; fourth instar larvae displayed a lower handling time than adults and attack rates were similar between larvae and adults and, between females and males (i.e., not sex-dependent). Coccinella undecimpunctata showed to be an effective predator for the biological control of M. persicae under controlled conditions, and it is hypothesized that the presence of both 4th instar larvae and adults of this ladybird beetle could increase the efficiency on field pest suppression.

Temperature is an important factor that mediates the pest population density and may affect the predator-prey relationship dynamics. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the temperature and development stage of Plutella xylostella individuals on the feeding preference of E. annulipes females. Three temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C), two development stages (larvae and pupae) and two feeding conditions related to the prey capture (with or without choice) were assessed. No matter the temperature, ring-legged earwig females showed a preference for eating larvae, instead of pupae. The temperature and choice conditions influenced the amount of consumed preys, but only for larvae (not for pupae). The lowest larvae consumption was observed at 18 degrees C, in both prey capture conditions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1517-6398	1983-4063		WOS:000517772500001

I investigated this activity over two seasons in a tomato greenhouse naturally infested with Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). The flight of C. attenuata individuals was affected by environmental factors and was increased in response to increases in temperature, the number of prey flights, and conspecific density. Predator and prey flights were distributed throughout the day, but there was a regular daily trend, each with two partially overlapping activity peaks. The possibility of predation was limited by differences in daily flight-activity times. Predatory flights comprised a small percentage (ca. 6%) of the total flights, with a predation success rate of 61%. Overall, the predatory activity of C. attenuata depended on the selection of hunting sites with good visibility to ensure a clear view before take-off and allow the capture of prey in flight. Similar numbers of overall flights were made by both sexes, but C. attenuata females performed more predation flights and territorial defense activities than males. The ecological role of C. attenuata and its limited adaptability to greenhouses is discussed in light of its possible use in biological control of whiteflies.									6	0	0	0	8	1	9			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000368131500010

This was not simply the result of occupying warmer microhabitats, because L. disjunctus larvae grew faster than C. resolutum at all constant temperatures between 10 and 25 degrees C in the laboratory. Multiple regression analysis showed that growth rates of both species were positively related to temperature and negatively related to larval size and to the square of temperature. The latter term is necessary to describe the decrease in growth rate at high temperatures. The equation predicted that the growth rate of L. disjunctus reached a maximum at 28.8 degrees C, whereas that of C. resolutum decreased above 22.4 degrees C. Small and medium-sized larvae of L. disjunctus ate more prey (Daphnia magna) in 15 min than C. resolutum at all prey densities. In 15-min experiments the attack coefficient for small L. disjunctus larvae was significantly larger than for small C. resolutum larvae and handling time for medium larvae was shorter. Other comparisons had large associated sampling errors, but the trends were the same. These differences may be associated with the relatively longer labia of L. disjunctus and its ability to change hunting methods from ambush to active search.									35	0	0	0	37	0	39			0008-4301			WOS:A1995TF32400012

The relationship between the functional and numerical responses of adult females of N. includens also was determined for prey densities ranging from 10 to 140 aphids per arena. Predation rates of unparasitized and parasitized second-instar N. includens were both fit by a type II functional response model with parameters as follows: unparasitized (a = 0.0768 hours(-1) and T-h = 0.975 h) and parasitized (a = 0.0787 hours(-1) and T-h = 0.8823 hours). Predation rates of unparasitized and parasitized fourth-instar N. includens were fit by type III and II models, respectively, with the following parameters: unparasitized (b = 0.1702 hours(-1) and T-h = 0.2369 hours) and parasitized (a = 0.038 h(-1) and T-h = 0.539 h). The unparasitized fourth-instar was the most voracious stage, having the highest attack rate and lowest handling time. Considering these attributes, it would seem to be the most effective stage of this predator against A. gossypii. Adult female lady beetles (N. includens) showed a type III functional response and their numerical response increase to prey density was curvilinearly related to prey density, with the highest number of eggs being produced at highest prey densities. The maximum saturation level for both predation and egg production for adult females occurred at a prey density of 120 aphids. Thus, a ratio 1:120 (predator: prey) should be used when releasing this species for augmentative biological control. Release of either fourth-instar or adult stage N. includens should be minimized the potentially negative effect of parasitism by H. flaminius on early developmental stages, and hence increase its efficiency in biocontrol programs.									20	1	0	0	21	1	24			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000294113300011	22251684

Five constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and six host densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64) were used during a 24-h period. At each temperature, 2-64 third-instar nymphs of A. gossypii were exposed to individual wasp mating pairs. A type II functional response model for both parasitoid wasps was fit separately for each temperature. The results showed that instantaneous attack rate (a) in A. colemani increased linearly as the temperature increases from 10 to 30 degrees C, but in A. matricariae, (a) increased almost linearly with temperature to reach a maximum at 25 degrees C, and then decreased at 30 degrees C, displaying an asymmetrical dome-shaped pattern. The highest instantaneous attack rate for A. colemani and A. matricariae were calculated 0.940 +/- 0.144 day(-1) at 30 degrees C and 0.687 +/- 0.157 day(-1) at 25 degrees C, respectively. Handling time (T-h) for A. colemani was inversely proportional to temperature and ranged from 0.093 +/- 0.026 day at 10 degrees C to 0.032 +/- 0.004 day at 30 degrees C, but in A. matricariae, (T-h) was between 0.078 +/- 0.015 day at 10 degrees C and 0.036 +/- 0.014 day at 20 degrees C. A. colemani achieved higher parasitism rate than A. matricariae at higher temperatures. This observation suggests that A. colemani maybe more effective for biological control of the cotton aphid during warmer periods.									64	9	0	0	69	0	81			1612-4758			WOS:000241612200002

Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0921-2973	1572-9761		WOS:000475643000013

Functional response parameters, handling time and searching efficiency are of particular value in understanding feeding behavior of a predator. The type of the functional response and the rates of its parameters are influenced by different factors. In this study, the functional responses of A. minki to densities of P. repense at different temperatures (15, 24 and 30 degrees C), prey instar (2nd and 4th instar nymphs), developmental stage of predator (4th nymph and adult) and sex of predator (male and female) were investigated. The effects of predator densities and interference on searching efficiency were estimated. Logistic regression and nonlinear least- square regression were used to estimate the type of the functional response and its parameters, respectively. In order to determine the per capita searching efficiency and interference coefficient, Nicholson's model and linear regression were used. The results showed a type II functional response on all experiments except of adult predators to 2nd instar nymphs of prey which exhibited a type III functional response. The greatest value of attack rate and the shortest handling time were seen at 30 degrees C. The per capita searching efficiency decreased as densities increased but there was no significant difference. The laboratory results suggest that A. minki has potential to control P. repens on ash trees but further research is needed under field conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0334-2123	1876-7184		WOS:000477593800005

Diet had no significant effect on defensive behavior of the caterpillars. The length of time that the caterpillars had fed (1 vs. 24 h) only influenced the frequency of caterpillars knocking the attacking stinkbugs away, with caterpillars knocking the stinkbugs away more often after 24 h of feeding. A second experiment tested the effects of diet (prey fed various concentrations of rutin), temperature (18-degrees-C and 28-degrees-C) and gender on consumption and growth parameters of fifth instar stinkbugs. At the cooler temperature, the bugs ate more, gained more weight but took twice as long to complete the stadium and consequently had reduced relative consumption and relative growth rates. Diet had no significant effect on biomass gained or stadium duration, but rutin-fed caterpillars did depress the stinkbugs' relative consumption rates. The effect of food quality on relative growth rate (RGR) was temperature dependent; rutin had no significant effect at the cooler temperature, but a high dose of rutin reduced RGR at the warmer temperature. Rutin had a greater negative impact on the females than the males. The effect of rutin on these predators was different than the effect on their prey (this study compared to Stamp (1990, 1992)): the negative effects of rutin seem to impact on the stinkbug's growth rather than on molting.									37	0	0	0	37	2	39			0029-8549			WOS:A1991GM33100021	28312145

While holding the mean prey encountered constant, we studied the effect of variance in prey arrival on the growth rates of two pit-building antlion species, Myrmeleon hyalinus and Cueta lineosa. Both species construct pit-traps in loose soils and ambush small prey in the same desert habitats, while differing in their preferred microhabitat: shaded vs. exposed to direct sunlight. We expected the light-preferring species to better tolerate variance in feeding than the shade-preferring species, owing to the former's higher stress tolerance and natural occurrence in microhabitats that are more likely poor with prey. While increasing variance in prey arrival reduced the growth rates of both species, this decrease was more pronounced in the species inhabiting the shaded and most likely prey-richer microhabitat. The greater variance tolerance of the light-preferring species stems from its ability to capture several prey items when almost simultaneously encountered. It could also be that this species has lower basal metabolic rate, which improves its starvation tolerance. These two antlion species differed in their prey capture success, starvation and thermal tolerance, and we thus suggest that their tolerance to variance in feeding opportunities and functional response offer an additional axis that enables them to coexist in the same desert habitats.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000416934900002		
J	Wooster, David E.; DeBano, Sandra J.; Madsen, Anne								Predators are more important than conspecifics and water temperature in influencing the microdistribution and behavior of a detritivorous stonefly								FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY				179	3			215	223		10.1127/1863-9135/2011/0179-0215				SEP 2011	2011	Biotic interactions influence the distribution and abundance of lotic organisms at multiple spatial scales. At small scales, intra-and interspecific competition for refugia from high flows and predation can affect the microdistribution of lotic organisms. The abiotic environment, such as water temperature, can have important impacts on lotic organism behavior, potentially influencing competitive and predator-prey dynamics. In the laboratory, we examined activity and refuge use of stonefly nymphs, Pteronarcys californica, in the presence and absence of conspecifics and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) across three temperatures. We predicted that at high temperatures competitive dynamics would decrease in importance. Crayfish captured and consumed stoneflies in similar to 25% of trials indicating that crayfish are effective predators as well as competitors for refuge. Crayfish influenced stonefly activity and refuge use, and their effect varied with time of day. During the day, crayfish hid in refuge; in response, stoneflies reduced refuge use and increased activity. At night, crayfish decreased refuge use and increased crawling resulting in a sharp decline in stonefly activity. These behavioral responses to crayfish may impact P. californica fitness as increased day-time activity increases risk of detection by visual predators and decreased night-time activity might decrease encounters with food resources. In contrast to the strong impacts of crayfish, stonefly density and water temperature did not significantly affect stonefly or crayfish refuge use or behavior. Our results indicate that a large competitor and potential predator has strong impacts on the microdistribution and behavior of P. californica.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1863-9135			WOS:000298141900006		
J	Joern, Anthony; Danner, Bradford J.; Logan, J. David; Wolesensky, William								Natural history of mass-action in predator-prey models: A case study from wolf spiders and grasshoppers								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				156	1			52	64		10.1674/0003-0031(2006)156[52:NHOMIP]2.0.CO;2				JUL 2006	2006	Mass-action models of predator-prey interactions assume that predators encounter prey according to their relative densities as scaled by functional responses, although models seldom specify critical natural history and behavioral mechanisms,that ensure that encounters actually occur. As a case study of this assumption, we assess the hypothesis that daily and seasonal activity and microhabitat use by wandering wolf spiders (Lycosidae: Schizocosa) searching for four common grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) are coincident under natural conditions. There was great overlap in seasonal phenology and use of microbabitats between spiders and grasshoppers. Grasshoppers that were suitably sized (10-20 mm in length) as prey for spiders were relatively abundant from late spring through summer in this grassland. Three of the four common grasshopper species used microhabitat in a similar way, but differed from a fourth common species, Phoetaliotes nebrascensis. However, when they were active, spiders were about equally distributed between open microhabitats on the ground and up in the vegetation so that all grasshopper species were at risk. In response to temperature, spiders were active for only a portion of the day during which grasshoppers were also active so that the actual daily "Window-of-opportunity" for capture each day was much smaller than expected. Spiders were more likely to be active during the early morning and evening, while grasshoppers were active during all daylight hours, most likely because of differences in thermal preferences. Schizocosa and their grasshopper prey are largely coincident in time and space except for overlap in daily activity which, presumably, reflects differences in thermal preferences. Consequently, overlap in daily time budgets that ensure actual encounter was reduced about 50%. The significance of this difference to the inclusion of simple mass-action dynamics in predator-prey models requires further consideration, but may be important.									23	0	0	0	22	0	23			0003-0031	1938-4238		WOS:000239611800006

Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the functional response of T. busseolae to egg densities of Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) under four different temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C). Results of logistic regression revealed a type III functional response for all temperatures tested and type of functional response was not affected by temperature. Roger's random parasite equation was fitted to observed data at 35 degrees C. In the other data sets (collected data under 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) Roger's equation could not provide meaningful parameters, therefore Holling's disk equation was used to fit the data. The attack rate for T. busseolae varying from 0.001784 to 0.10704, 0.0026 to 0.152, 0.0024 to 0.144 and 0.000866 to 0.05196 per h and estimated handling times were 0.59, 0.50, 0.53 and 0.29 h at 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Based on asymptotic 95% confidence intervals, functional response parameters did not differ significantly from 20 to 30 degrees C, which indicates that handling time and attack rate are least affected by the temperature changes. The results suggest a similar performance of T. busseolae against S. nonagrioides eggs at temperatures of 20-30 degrees C. These results show that T. busseolae is well adapted to temperature changes during the sugarcane growing season.									12	3	0	0	10	1	15			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000277255800008

It is worldwide in distribution and primarily managed through typical dependence on insecticides, which resulted in health and the environmental challenges and selected for resistance development inS. liturafield populations. Resistance caused chemical control failures andS. lituraoutbreaks around the world. This necessitated development of eco-friendly alternative approaches such as biological control. With this view, current study investigated the functional response ofHarmonia axyridis(Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) at various growth stages (i.e., 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instars, and male and female stages) and temperatures (i.e., 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) againstS. lituraeggs to enable the recognition of efficient biocontrol stages that could be utilized to suppressS. liturapopulations. In our findings, egg consumption depended on the growth stage of the predator as well as temperature. All stages consumedS. lituraeggs, but more promising stages with active egg consumption were the 4th instar and adults (male and female) typically at higher temperatures (25-35 degrees C). We conclude that these stages may be exploited to suppressS. liturapopulations in fields and greenhouses. Spodoptera litura(Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a major pest of several economically important crops with worldwide distribution. Use of insecticides is the principal strategy for its management, which has subsequently led to insecticide resistance and control failures. Functional response ofHarmonia axyridis(Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) at larval and adult stages was evaluated in this study, usingS. lituraeggs as the prey at various temperatures varying between 15 and 35 degrees C. Based on logistic model findings, linear parameters of various predatory stages ofH. axyridisat various temperatures were significantly negative, which indicate a type II functional response. The theoretical maximum number (T/T-h) of eggs consumed increased with increasing temperature across all predatory stages. According to the random predator equation, the coefficients of attack rate increased and that of handling time decreased as the temperature increased. The 4th instar and adult stages were superior candidates for biocontrol of the target prey, typically at higher temperatures. The maximum attack rate (0.546 +/- 0.058 h(-1)) and lowest handling time (0.189 +/- 0.004 h) were exhibited by the females at 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively, whereas these parameters were inferior for early instars. These findings clearly depict that the 4th instar and adult predators are efficient egg consumers and can serve as potential suppressors ofS. liturafield populations. The limitations of the predictions formulated by functional response trials are also discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2075-4450		WOS:000580385000001	32882812

In the laboratory, which was conducted at 25 degrees C at 60-80% RH, with a 16L : 8D photoperiod, we examined the functional response of this species to three different pests, namely the sciarid fly (Bradysia sp.), the tobacco whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and the leaf miner Liriomyza trifolii. In the greenhouse, we studied the population dynamics of the predator and its prey on pepper and water melon crops grown in southern Spain. Adult hunter flies were found to exhibit a type I functional response to adult sciarid flies and whiteflies, but a type II response to adult leaf miners. The type II response was a result of the greater difficulty in capturing and handling leaf miners compared to the other two species. The dynamics of the predator-prey interaction in the greenhouse revealed that the predator specializes mainly on adult sciarids and that the presence of the other prey can be supplemental, but is never essential for survival of the predator; this, however, is crop-dependent. The results oil the dynamics of the predator-prey systems were obtained through a known population dynamics model with modifications.									11	1	0	0	7	0	12				1802-8829		WOS:000265937900007

As physical performance often affects the outcome of predator-prey interactions, environmental temperature can influence the ability of ectotherms to capture prey and/or defend themselves against predators. However, previous research on the kinematics of ectotherms suggests that some species may use elastic storage mechanisms when attacking or defending, thereby mitigating the effects of sub-optimal temperature. Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) are a speciose group of ectothermic viperid snakes that rely on crypsis, rattling and striking to deter predators. We examined the influence of body temperature on the behavior and kinematics of two rattlesnake species (Crotalus oreganus helleri and Crotalus scutulatus) when defensively striking towards a threatening stimulus. We recorded defensive strikes at body temperatures ranging from 15-35 degrees C. We found that strike speed and speed of mouth gaping during the strike were positively correlated with temperature. We also found a marginal effect of temperature on the probability of striking, latency to strike and strike outcome. Overall, warmer snakes are more likely to strike, strike faster, open their mouth faster and reach maximum gape earlier than colder snakes. However, the effects of temperature were less than would be expected for purely muscle-driven movements. Our results suggest that, although rattlesnakes are at a greater risk of predation at colder body temperatures, their decrease in strike performance may be mitigated to some extent by employing mechanisms in addition to skeletal muscle contraction (e.g. elastic energy storage) to power strikes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000576693500013	32561628

In animals that grow throughout the year, such as tropical lizards, growth is therefore predicted to be faster during the rainy season. We test this prediction using a population of Anolis nebulosusby describing the growth trajectories of both sexes using nonlinear regression models, and we then correlate the growth rates of individuals with food available in the environment, precipitation, and temperature. The Von Bertalanffy model fits the growth rates of the females better, while the logistic-by-length model fits the males better. According to both models, the males grew faster than females, reaching slightly smaller sizes at adulthood. Males reached sexual maturity when 35mm long, at an age of seven months, and females matured at 37mm (SVL), taking nine months to reach this size. In 1989, juvenile males and females grew more in both seasons (rainy and dry) than adults; for 1990, there were no differences by season or between age classes. These results are interesting since in the 1989 and 1990 rainy seasons, practically the same orders of prey and the greatest abundance of prey available in the environment were registered. A possible explanation could be that predation was more intense in 1990 than in 1989. There is little evidence that food, temperature, and humidity affect growth rates of A. nebulosus, refuting our predictions. This is mainly due to the low variation in growth observed in 1990. Therefore we think that the growth of this species reflects a complex combination of ecological and genetic factors.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2045-7758			WOS:000461114900040	30847092

Direct and indirect effects of warming on aphids, their predators, and ant mutualists								ECOLOGY				95	6			1479	1484		10.1890/13-1977.1				JUN 2014	2014	Species exist within communities of other interacting species, so an exogenous force that directly affects one species can indirectly affect all other members of the community. In the case of climate change, many species may be affected directly and subsequently initiate numerous indirect effects that propagate throughout the community. Therefore, the net effect of climate change on any one species is a function of the direct and indirect effects. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on corn leaf aphids, a pest of corn and other grasses, by performing an experimental manipulation of temperature, predators, and two common aphid-tending ants. Although warming had a positive direct effect on aphid population growth rate, warming reduced aphid abundance when ants and predators were present. This occurred because winter ants, which aggressively defend aphids from predators under control temperatures, were less aggressive toward predators and less abundant when temperatures were increased. In contrast, warming increased the abundance of cornfield ants, but they did not protect aphids from predators with the same vigor as winter ants. Thus, warming broke down the ant-aphid mutualism and counterintuitively reduced the abundance of this agricultural pest.									44	0	0	0	38	0	44			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000337218500007	25039213

We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to examine how detection of prey DNA in the gut content of predators was influenced by digestion time and temperature. Such knowledge is critical before applying PCR-based gut content analysis to field collected predators. Larvae of the two-spotted ladybeetle (Adalia bipunctata L.) were fed with the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) at either 21 degrees C or 14 degrees C. After consuming one aphid, the predators were allowed to digest the prey for a range of time periods up to 24 hours. The influence of temperature on A. bipunctata feeding behavior was also recorded. From the fed larvae, total DNA was extracted and PCR reactions with R. padi specific primers were run. The number of A. bipunctata that tested positive for R. padi DNA was negatively related to the length of digestion time. Temperature influenced larval feeding behavior but did not have a significant effect on R. padi DNA detection. After pooling the data from both temperature treatments we estimated the time point when R. padi DNA could be amplified from 50% of the fed A. bipunctata by PCR to be 4.87 hours. With such a rapid decrease in prey DNA detection success, positive PCR reactions will most likely be the result of predation events occurring shortly before capture. If a defined digestion temperature range has proven not to influence prey detection, PCR data obtained from predators collected within that particular range can be interpreted in the same way.									23	2	0	0	23	0	24			1672-9609			WOS:000249883300001

Across these larger spatial extents, adaptation can play an increasing role in determining the outcome of species interactions. If local adaptation is common, then our ability to generalize measures of species interaction strength across communities will be limited without an additional understanding of the genetic variation underlying interaction traits. In the context of predator prey interactions, prey individuals commonly are expected to reduce risky foraging behaviors and subsequent growth under predation threat. However, rapid growth into a large body size can defend against gape-limited predators, creating a tradeoff between increased predation risk due to elevated foraging activity and decreased predation risk due to large size. Here I combine field observations, natural selection experiments, and common garden assays to understand potential adaptations of spotted salamander Ambystoma maculatum larvae to gape-limited and gape-unconstrained predators. Field observations and natural selection trials suggested antagonistic selection on prey body size among ponds dominated by gape-limited predator salamanders A. opacum and gape-unconstrained beetle larvae Dytiscus. In common garden experiments, prey from sites with high gape-limited predation risk grew larger than those from other sites, suggesting the evolution of rapid growth into a Prey size refuge. Larvae from all sites grew to a large size when exposed to the gape-limited N. viridescens predator's kairomones. Hence, induced rapid growth into a size refuge may be an adaptive response to gape-limited predation risk. Results point to an important role for cross-community generalizations based on functional classifications of predators by their gape constraints and inter-site genetic variation in prey growth rates and behaviors.									43	0	0	0	40	0	43			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000258034400009

To maximize the use of A. gifuensis for biological control of M. persicae, the functional response of A. gifuensis using M. persicae as a host was determined at 4 constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and 20 host densities (5, 10, 15, increased incrementally by 5, to a maximum of 100) on a 6-leaf sweet pepper plant (30 cm in height) over a 24 h period. Roger's random parasitoid equation (RRPE) and Holling's disc equation (HDE) were used to fit the data. The results showed that functional responses at all temperatures were type II, and the instantaneous attack rate (a) in both models increased as temperature increased from 15 to 25 degrees C and then decreased at 30 degrees C. The highest instantaneous attack rate (a) for A. gifuensis was at 25 degrees C for the 2 models, 1.3203 +/- 0.0415 d(-1) for HDE and 4.295e+03 d(-1) for RRPE. The handling time (T-h) for A. gifuensis by HDE was between 0.0105 +/- 0.0002 d at 20 degrees C and 0.0214 +/- 0.0009 d at 30 degrees C and by RRPE was between 1.265e-02 +/- 3.808e-04 d at 20 degrees C and 0.0218 +/- 0.0010 d at 30 degrees C. Aphidius gifuensis achieved its highest parasitism rate at medium temperatures. The results from this study showed that A. gifuensis performed best at 20 degrees C, suggesting that this parasitoid will be more effective as a biological control agent for M. persicae when the temperature is under 30 degrees C.									5	2	0	0	4	0	6			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000391525700019

Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. The model captured >70% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000458963200002	30079547

Here, we present some aspects of its ecology from two caves in central Ghana. Our main objective was to assess the nightly and annual flight activity and to examine the influences of ambient temperature on flight activity. We tested the hypothesis that flight activity of the species is concentrated at certain periods of the night and the year using mist-netting data from 2,712 captured bats. We found no evidence for annual fluctuations in flight activity, probably due to no distinct seasonal limitation of food resources, no migration, and the lack of extreme environmental conditions in the study area. Our hypothesis of concentrated nightly flight activity was confirmed for one cave but not for the other. Flight activity was concentrated early in the night (20:00, 21:00 and 22:00 hours) at one cave, possibly to take advantage of locally available early active prey insects, while it was uniformly distributed throughout the night at the other. Lastly, we found a reduction in the flight activity of H. cf. ruber when there was a distinct drop in temperature over the night. We therefore suggest the reduction in flight activity may result from the direct effects of temperature on prey abundance as the bats responded by reducing activity to avoid excessive prey search costs.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1508-1109	1733-5329		WOS:000423030100011		
J	Wilcox, Aidan; Lewis, Sara								Fluorescence in fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae): using sentinel prey to investigate a possible aposematic signal								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				102	3			614	618		10.1653/024.102.0342				SEP 2019	2019	While fireflies are most renowned for their bioluminescent signals, several species also have been shown to possess UV and blue-induced fluorescence. In a field study, we used a sentinel prey approach to investigate whether this trait might serve as an aposematic function in chemically defended fireflies. We also examined and provide the first detailed description of green and red patterns of blue light-induced fluorescence in the adults and larvae of Ellychnia corrusca (L.) (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). We placed artificial prey models with and without fluorescent markings in a forested area of Belmont, Massachusetts, USA, where they were exposed to natural predators. Clay models were styled to resemble Photinus fireflies, the most common firefly genus in this area, and a close relative of Ellychnia. The field study was conducted from Oct through May in Belmont, Massachusetts; this is the period when adults of the diurnal non-luminescent firefly E. corrusca are overwintering on trees. We observed considerable seasonal variation in attack rates, and marks on the clay models indicated they were attacked by avian, mammal, and arthropod predators. However, no difference was seen between fluorescent and non-fluorescent models in predator attack rates. This suggests that fireflies' fluorescent markings do not serve as an aposematic signal, at least for the predator guild active in New England woodlands.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000488271000027

Experiments were performed in petri dishes at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h in a controlled temperature room. Both predators showed Type II of functional response with respect to larvae, determined by a logistic regression model. However, T. nigrescens significantly killed more larvae of D. porcellus compared with A. biannulipes. This behavior, however, changed to a linear functional response (Type I), when pupae of D. porcellus were offered to both predators, possibly because of their immobility. In addition, there was no significant difference between T. nigrescens and A. biannulipes in terms of the killed pupae. Parameters of the Holling disc equation for both predators were estimated. Estimated handling time on larvae of D. porcellus for T. nigrescens and A. biannulipes was 0.254 and 0.677h and the rate of searching efficiency was 0.289 and 0.348 h(-1), respectively. Results indicated that T. nigrescens was a more suitable candidate for augmentative release for D. porcellus control than A. biannulipes. However, semifield studies are required to draw firm conclusions.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000396902400010	28011463

Three constant temperatures (15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and six prey densities (5, 10, 20, 35, 50, and 70) were tested over a 24-h period. Nesidiocoris tenuis exhibited a type II functional response at 15 and 25 degrees C, and a type III response at 35 degrees C. The number of prey consumed by the predator increased with increase in the prey density at all temperatures. Temperature influenced attack rates and handling times. The highest attack rate occurred at 35 degrees C at high densities (35, 50, and 70 prey) and the lowest handling time was recorded at 35 degrees C. The maximum attack rates (T/Th) were 17.13, 42.12, and 45.07 whitefly pupae per day at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively. As a result, the value of a/T-h indicates that N. tenuis was relatively more efficient in attacking B. tabaci at 35 degrees C than at lower temperatures. Results suggest that the ability of N. tenuis to detect and consume B. tabaci over a broad range of temperatures, especially high temperatures (25-35 degrees C), makes this mirid a good candidate for the biological control of whiteflies in warm environments, such as greenhouses.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7				1802-8829		WOS:000419219900021		
J	Li, Chengchun; Xu, Kuidong; Lei, Yanli								Growth and grazing responses to temperature and prey concentration of Condylostoma spatiosum, a large benthic ciliate, feeding on Oxyrrhis marina								AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				64	1			97	104		10.3354/ame01521				2011	2011	Condylostoma is as a group of very large-sized ciliates frequently dominant in various marine benthic microbial communities. However, little is known about the effects of temperature and food concentration on its growth and grazing. Here, using the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina as prey, we determined the specific growth rate, cell volume, specific production, and ingestion rate of C. spatiosum at different temperatures and prey concentrations. These growth and grazing parameters typically followed a hyperbolic response to prey concentration. By applying iterative curve-fitting to the data at each temperature, we found that, with increasing temperature, the maximum specific growth rate, maximum specific production, and maximum ingestion rate of C. spatiosum generally increased, while the maximum cell volume decreased. The gross growth efficiency of C. spatiosum generally decreased at saturated prey concentration from about 45 to 25% as the temperature increased from 12 to 24 degrees C. By fitting these data iteratively to multi-variable nonlinear models, we obtained predictive equations for the growth rate, cell volume, and ingestion rate with respect to temperature and prey concentration.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0948-3055			WOS:000292988300008

We re-analyze literature data and present our own results on growth rates of larvae of 14 species of Libellulidae reared at different temperatures. Temperature response curves (TRC) were fitted in order to estimate two relevant components of the thermal reaction, namely the optimum temperature for growth (T-opt) and the increase of growth rate with temperature (Q(10)). We also examined what is known about the thermal minimum (T-min) and the thermal maximum (T-max) for growth to delimit the thermal ranges of odonates. All information indicates that larval growth is generally warm adapted, with species-specific variation of T-opt of 21-31 degrees C, T-min of 8-12 degrees C, and T-max of up to 44 degrees C (the latter being the upper lethal limit, the true T-max for growth remains unknown). The values of Q(10) distinguish some more specialized species, mostly with high T-opt and of tropical origin, and others being more thermal generalists, often being temperate species and/or from lotic habitats. We examine some biotic and abiotic factors affecting the temperature response of growth and we discuss the temperature response in the light of global warming.									21	0	1	0	24	0	25			1388-7890	2159-6719		WOS:000353767400003

As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.									21	0	0	0	17	0	21			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000457652200005

In the current study, we report an instance of targeted trap destruction by an invertebrate and a novel context for rescue behavior. We found that foragers of the granivorous desert ant (Veromessor pergandei) identify and cooperatively dismantle spiderwebs (Araneae: Theridiidae, Steatoda spp., and Asagena sp.) During group foraging, workers ensnared in webs are recovered by sisters, which transport them to the nest and groom away their silk bindings. The presence of an ensnared nestmate and chemical alarm signal significantly increased the probability of web removal and nestmate retrieval. A subset of larger-bodied foragers participated in web removal, and 6.3% became tangled or were captured by spiders. Most animals that perform rescue behavior live in small groups, but V. pergandei colonies include tens of thousands of short-lived workers. To maintain their size, large colonies must collect enough seeds to produce 650 new ants each day. We hypothesize that the removal of spiderwebs allows for an unimpeded income of seeds on a single foraging path during a brief daily temperature window. Despite the cost to individuals, webs are recognized and removed only when workers are captured in them.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000482091000011	31553216	
J	Sugahara, Michio; Nishimura, Yasuichiro; Sakamoto, Fumio								Differences in Heat Sensitivity between Japanese Honeybees and Hornets under High Carbon Dioxide and Humidity Conditions inside Bee Balls								ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE				29	1			30	36		10.2108/zsj.29.30				JAN 2012	2012	Upon capture in a bee ball (i.e., a dense cluster of Japanese honeybees forms in response to a predatory attack), an Asian giant hornet causes a rapid increase in temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2), and humidity. Within five min after capture, the temperature reaches 46 degrees C, and the CO2 concentration reaches 4%. Relative humidity gradually rises to 90% or above in 3 to 4 min. The hornet dies within 10 min of its capture in the bee ball. To investigate the effect of temperature, CO2, and humidity on hornet mortality, we determined the lethal temperature of hornets exposed for 10 min to different humidity and CO2/O-2 (oxygen) levels. In expiratory air (3.7% CO2), the lethal temperature was >= 2 degrees lower than that in normal air. The four hornet species used in this experiment died at 44-46 degrees C under these conditions. Hornet death at low temperatures results from an increase in CO2 level in bee balls. Japanese honeybees generate heat by intense respiration, as an overwintering strategy, which produces a high CO2 and humidity environment and maintains a tighter bee ball. European honeybees are usually killed in the habitat of hornets. In contrast, Japanese honeybees kill hornets without sacrificing themselves by using heat and respiration by-products and forming tight bee balls.									11	0	0	0	10	0	12			0289-0003			WOS:000298674800005	22233493	
J	Schmalhofer, VR; Casey, TM								Crab spider hunting performance is temperature insensitive								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				24	3			345	353		10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00198.x				AUG 1999	1999	1. Laboratory and field experiments showed that the hunting performance of two flower-dwelling crab spiders, Misumenops asperatus and Misumenoides formosipes, was thermally insensitive over a broad range of temperatures normally experienced by these spiders.2. In the laboratory, HP, a behavioural metric of spider hunting performance, was similar for spiders of a given species over an approximate to 30 degrees C temperature range.3. Spiders in the field captured predominantly hymenopterans and dipterans, and field hunting performance, measured as the number of prey captured per spider per day, also proved to be unaffected by temperature.4. These findings counter the general rule that physiological/ecological performance in terrestrial arthropods is temperature dependent.5. Freedom from temperature constraints on the capacity of crab spiders to capture prey may be due to the use of venom and/or to muscle physiological adaptations for anaerobic metabolism.6. Wide thermal performance breadth increases the spectrum of prey available to M. asperatus and M. formosipes by allowing spiders to hunt prey active during cooler periods of the day as well as those active during warmer periods.7. Wide thermal performance breadth also benefits M. asperatus and M. formosipes due to adult phenology; both species experience a seasonal temperature shift during the adult phase.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0307-6946			WOS:000082489500013

Two reproductive modes have been found in this species. Typically, female wasps produce haploid male offspring from unfertilized eggs and diploid female offspring from fertilized eggs (bisexual). However, they can also produce only diploid females when they are infected with Wolbachia, though the eggs are unfertilized (thelytokokous). To investigate the potential of a thelytokous Wolbachia-infected (TdW(+)) and a bisexual uninfected (Td) T. dendrolimi strain as inundative biocontrol agents, the functional responses of both strains toward their natural enemy (Asian corn borer) were evaluated at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results revealed two types of functional response for both strains: type II and III. TdW(+) strain displayed type II at 30 degrees C (high temperature) and III at 20 degrees C (low temperature) and 25 degrees C, while Td strain displayed type II at 20 degrees C and III at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The comparison of functional response between two strains indicated TdW(+) and Td strain had no significant difference at 20 degrees C. However, the estimated host handling time of the TdW(+) strain was significantly shorter than that of the Td strain at 25 degrees C, and TdW(+) strain had significantly higher instantaneous search rate and shorter handling time than Td strain at 30 degrees C. Shorter host handling time and higher instantaneous search rate in thelytokous Wolbachia-infected T. dendrolimi showed that this strain might be more effective for controlling Asian corn borer.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			1226-8615	1876-7990		WOS:000419749200007

A case study in avocado agro-ecosystems in Spain								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				59	1-2			27	42		10.1007/s10493-012-9560-y				FEB 2013	2013	Climate change is one of the most important factors affecting the phenology, distribution, composition and diversity of organisms. In agricultural systems many pests and natural enemies are arthropods. As poikilotherm organisms, their body temperature is highly dependent on environmental conditions. Because higher trophic levels typically have lower tolerance to high temperatures than lower trophic levels, trends towards increasing local or regional temperatures may affect the strength of predator/prey interactions and disrupt pest control. Furthermore, increasing temperatures may create climate corridors that could facilitate the invasion and establishment of invasive species originating from warmer areas. In this study we examined the effect of environmental conditions on the dynamics of an agro-ecosystem community located in southern Spain, using field data on predator/prey dynamics and climate gathered during four consecutive years. The study system was composed of an ever-green tree species (avocado), an exotic tetranychid mite, and two native species of phytoseiid mites found in association with this new pest. We also present a climatological analysis of the temperature trend in the area of study during the last 28 years, as evidence of temperature warming occurring in the area. We found that the range of temperatures with positive per capita growth rates was much wider in prey than in predators, and that relative humidity contributed to explain the growth rate variation in predators, but not in prey. Predator and prey differences in thermal performance curves could explain why natural enemies did not respond numerically to the pest when environmental conditions were harsh.									18	0	0	0	16	1	18			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000313653200003	22527837

The inevitable increase in body size during ontogeny is associated with changes in both resource use and predation risk, which results in the ontogenetic shift in habitat preferences. In this study, we examined whether the shift in preferred body temperatures (T(p)s) of newt larvae Triturus alpestris increases the T(p)s deviation of the most vulnerable stages (after hatching and during metamorphosis) from the T(p)s range of their main predator, dragonfly larvae Aeshna cyanea - the 'predator-free temperatures' hypothesis. Analyses of thermoregulatory behaviour in the laboratory thermal gradient showed that freshly hatched newt larvae maintained lower water temperatures than larvae in later stages, whose T(p)s largely fell into the T(p)s range of dragonfly larvae. With respect to the thermal quality of natural habitat, the anti-predator effectiveness of the T(p)s shift decreased during development. Water temperatures in natural habitats were located largely below the preferred body temperature range of both newt and dragonfly larvae, which limits their potential thermal niche partitioning. We conclude that factors other than predator avoidance drive the ontogenetic T(p)s shift in our model system.									14	2	0	0	14	0	15			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000269743600009		
J	WHITE, EG; SEDCOLE, JR								A 20-YEAR RECORD OF ALPINE GRASSHOPPER ABUNDANCE, WITH INTERPRETATIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				15	2			139	152						1991	1991	A 20-year capture-recapture study of alpine grasshoppers spanned three distinct sequences of abundance, featuring in turn dis-equilibrium, equilibrium and secondary cyclic equilibrium. This succession of population patterns in the most abundant species, Paprides nitidus, retained high stability between generations. It arose via superimposed life-cycle pathways and adaptive responses between grasshopper phenologies and their environmental constraints. The responses were identified by correlation coefficient analysis across extensive matrices (11 500+ correlations) of environmental records x time-lagged grasshopper estimators. An estimator of resident population members performed better than total population estimators. The observed retention of population stability despite shifts in the patterns of abundance implies some predictability, and potential effects of climate change (increased temperature, rainfall and raindays) are examined in a context of global warming. It is concluded that flora and fauna could eventually become depleted in alpine regions due to the displacement of grasshopper populations to vegetation-scree margins where physical weathering and vegetation instability are often pronounced.The highly flexible P. nitidus life cycle emphasises a high level of variation in egg phenology, whereby alternative overwintering pathways (quiescence, diapause, extended diapause) lead to variable life-cycle durations. The schematic cycle accommodates two quite different species, Sigaus australis and Brachaspis nivalis, and is throughout the cycle, and the 20-year census history suggests that a classic predator-prey response may arise between a native skink species (Reptilia) and grasshoppers.									6	1	0	0	6	0	8			0110-6465			WOS:A1991HA88800006

Local adaptation to temperature conserves top-down control in a grassland food web								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				278	1721			3102	3107		10.1098/rspb.2011.0030				OCT 22 2011	2011	A fundamental limitation in many climate change experiments is that tests represent relatively short-term 'shock' experiments and so do not incorporate the phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary change that may occur during the gradual process of climate change. However, capturing this aspect of climate change effects in an experimental design is a difficult challenge that few studies have accomplished. I examined the effect of temperature and predator climate history in food webs composed of herbaceous plants, generalist grasshopper herbivores and spider predators across a natural 4.8 degrees C temperature gradient spanning 500 km in northeastern USA. In these grasslands, the effects of rising temperatures on the plant community are indirect and arise via altered predator-herbivore interactions. Experimental warming had no direct effect on grasshoppers, but reduced predation risk effects by causing spiders from all study sites to seek thermal refuge lower in the plant canopy. However, spider thermal tolerance corresponded to spider origin such that spiders from warmer study sites tolerated higher temperatures than spiders from cooler study sites. As a consequence, the magnitude of the indirect effect of spiders on plants did not differ along the temperature gradient, although a reciprocal transplant experiment revealed significantly different effects of spider origin on the magnitude of top-down control. These results suggest that variation in predator response to warming may maintain species interactions and associated food web processes when faced with long term, chronic climate warming.									43	1	0	0	39	0	44			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000294756400013	21367789

This study investigated the behavioral performance of Habrobracon hebetor Say on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller larvae treated with Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Soroldn sensu lato (s.l.) (isolate M14) at two different temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). A type II functional response was observed in female wasps of all treatments. Estimated handling time and attack rate values were not statistically different at two thermal conditions. Female wasps avoided the odor of fungus infected host larvae when offered simultaneously with healthy ones at 30 degrees C revealed by olfactory choice test. The number of untreated larvae parasitized by H. hebetor females was significantly differed between temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). Overall, this study suggests that application of M. anisopliae s.l. for biological control of E. kuehniella is compatible with concurrent use of H. hebetor at 30 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Functional response of Harmonia dimidiata (fab.) to melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover under laboratory conditions								PHYTOPARASITICA				45	3			373	379		10.1007/s12600-017-0599-5				JUL 2017	2017	Functional response of Harmonia dimidiata (Fab.) to melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover was studied in the laboratory at 25 +/- 0.5 A degrees C, 70 +/- 5% RH and 12L:12D photoperiod. All the predator stages exhibited Type II functional response to the aphid. Based on Rogers's random predator equation the predator's attack rate was lowest (0.128) in the first-instar and highest (0.21) in the adult stage. Handling times of the adult beetle and the fourth-instar (0.148 and 0.164 h, respectively) were much shorter than other stages. The maximum number of aphids that could be consumed over a period of 24 h by first, second, third and fourth instar; and adult of H. dimidiata was estimated to be 47.2, 80.2, 79.7, 146.2 and 161.7 aphids/ predator. Functional response parameters indicate that the adult beetles and the fourth-instar were the most voracious stages and could be important for the biological control of the aphid.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6			0334-2123	1876-7184		WOS:000408699100010

In this study, the functional response of female Scymnus syriacus Marseul (Col.: Coccinellidae) to different densities (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) of third instar nymphs of Aphis gossypii Glover as prey was studied in an open patch experiment in a growth chamber (25 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16L:8D h). Using logistic regression, a type II functional response for female Scymnus syriacus was determined. The searching efficiency (a') and handling time (T-h) of the female predator using non linear least-square regression were estimated as 0.0769 +/- 0.0136 h(-1) and 0.3103 +/- 0.0438 h, respectively. Mean times required for the female predator to settle in a patch were 10.20 +/- 4.28, 6.58 +/- 2.58, 12.58 +/- 4.50, 4.53 +/- 1.48, 5.14 +/- 2.59, 3.87 +/- 3.52 min at different prey densities, respectively. Maximum theoretical predation rate (T/T-h) estimated by Rogers' model for the female predator was 77.34. The proportion of female predators remaining in open patches at the end of the experiment was dependent on prey density (R-2 = 0.876). The type of functional response obtained here agrees with studies on this predator in closed patches.

J	Li Ding-Xu; Tian Juan; Shen Zuo-Rui								Functional response of the predator Scolothrips takahashii to hawthorn spider mite, Tetranychus viennensis: effect of age and temperature								BIOCONTROL				52	1			41	61		10.1007/s10526-006-9015-7				FEB 2007	2007	A leaf disc bioassay was employed to examine the effects of temperature and predator age on functional response of an acarophagous thrips, Scolothrips takahashii Priesner, to hawthorn spider mite, Tetranychus viennensis Zacher, in the laboratory. The results indicated that the predatory thrips exhibited type-II functional responses against the mites under various temperatures, and that females are more voracious than males. Analysis showed that temperature had significant effects on the predatory capacity of adult thrips over the range of 20-35 degrees C. Attack rate in females linearly increased with temperature while in males it was independent of temperature. Handling times in both males and females decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Extended response models describing the functional response with temperature incorporated as a parameter were developed, yielding an estimated maximum numbers of prey attacked at four temperatures were 38.38, 55.06, 71.74 and 88.42 eggs per day for females, and 15.11, 26.11, 37.11 and 48.01 eggs per day for males, respectively. The age of predator affected both the type of the functional response shown and the magnitude of predation by S.takahashii on the spider mite. Females of various ages exhibited Type-II functional responses with similar attack rates, but handling time prolonged linearly as age increased: the handling times in 15- and 18-d-old females were significantly longer than in 6-d-old thrips. However, Type-I functional responses were determined for males aged 12 d or more; the maximum number of prey eaten in 24 h decreased as age increased. The implications of the results for the management of hawthorn spider mite are discussed.									31	3	0	0	33	1	36			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000243602200004

We report here the results of an empirical study whose aim was to test for a negative association between habitat niche breadth and foraging performance. As a model system to address this question, we used two highly abundant species of pit-building antlions varying in their habitat niche breadth: the habitat generalist Myrmeleon hyalinus, which inhabits a variety of soil types but occurs mainly in sandy soils, and the habitat specialist Cueta lineosa, which is restricted to light soils such as loess. Both species were able to discriminate between the two soils, with each showing a distinct and higher preference to the soil type providing higher prey capture success and characterizing its primary habitat-of-origin. As expected, only small differences in the foraging performances of the habitat generalist were evident between the two soils, while the performance of the habitat specialist was markedly reduced in the alternative sandy soil. Remarkably, in both soil types, the habitat generalist constructed pits and responded to prey faster than the habitat specialist, at least under the temperature range of this study. Furthermore, prey capture success of the habitat generalist was higher than that of the habitat specialist irrespective of the soil type or prey ant species encountered, implying a positive association between habitat niche-breadth and foraging performance. Alternatively, C. lineosa specialization to light soils does not necessarily confer upon its superiority in utilizing such habitats. We thus suggest that habitat specialization in C. lineosa is either an evolutionary dead-end, or, more likely, that this species' superiority in light soils can only be evident when considering additional niche axes.									29	0	0	0	28	0	30			1932-6203			WOS:000303309000028	22438939	
J	Gilioli, G; Baumgartner, J; Vacante, V								Temperature influences on functional response of Coenosia attenuata (Diptera : Muscidae) individuals								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				98	5			1524	1530						OCT 2005	2005	The functional response of single Coenosia attenuta Stein (Diptera: Muscidae) adult females to Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) adults has been investigated at different but constant temperatures and prey densities. The experiments were conducted in cages over a,,vide range of temperatures between 12 and 42 degrees C. At each experimental temperature, the number of attacks increases with increasing prey density up to a maximum attack rate referred to as demand rate. A ratio-dependent and demand-driven functional response model was appropriate to describe the attack rate at different temperatures. Both the demand and the search rate linearly increased with increasing temperatures throughout the range. Based on these results, a temperature- and prey density-dependent bidimensional attack rate model was developed and parameterized. The resulting response surface shows that C. attenuata is active over a wide range of temperatures (from approximate to 12 to 36 degrees C) and attacks occur up to 42 degrees C. Thus, C. attenuata may be a promising biological control agent in Mediterranean greenhouses. To support this conclusion, further studies including the evaluation of spatial scale effects on the search rate and the consideration of the economically relevant whitefly prey are recommended.									21	2	0	0	22	1	25			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000232410700014	16334320

Cheng, Brian/0000-0003-1679-8398			Trophic sensitivity of invasive predator and native prey interactions: integrating environmental context and climate change								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				31	3			642	652		10.1111/1365-2435.12759				MAR 2017	2017	Climate change is predicted to intensify the impacts of invasive species by enhancing their performance relative to their native counterparts. However, few studies have compared the performance of invasive predators and native prey, despite the fact that non-native predators are well known to disrupt native communities. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis' suggests that predators are less tolerant of increasing environmental stress than their prey, whereas the tolerant invaders hypothesis' suggests that invaders are more tolerant than native species due to selection during the introduction process. It is therefore unclear how invasive predators will respond to increasing climate stressors. We coupled physiological measurements (thermal tolerance, thermal optima, salinity tolerance, predation rate) with environmental time-series data to assess the effects of warming and extreme low salinity events on non-native predators (gastropods) and native prey (oysters) from a coastal ecosystem. In general support of the trophic sensitivity hypothesis, we found that both non-native predators exhibited lower thermal optima relative to native prey, lower salinity tolerance and one predator was less tolerant of warming. However, because warming tolerance was extremely high (i.e. habitat temperature is 79-21 degrees C below thermal tolerance), near-term warming may first increase predator performance (consumption and growth rates), with negative effects on prey. Low salinity will likely produce heterogeneous effects on predator-prey interactions due to varying watershed sizes among estuaries that control the duration of low salinity events. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis may be a useful framework for understanding community responses to extreme climate change, which portends a decoupling of predator-prey interactions. However, we conclude that this hypothesis must be evaluated in environmental context and that coupling physiological metrics with insitu environmental data offers the best predictive power of near-term climate change impacts on invaded communities. Within our study system, warming is likely to intensify the impacts of both invasive predators, which may greatly reduce the abundance of the native oyster, a species of conservation and restoration focus.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000395347300010

While better food conditions typically lead to faster growth and earlier maturation at larger body size and hence higher fecundity, the effects of predation risk can vary depending on its strength and selectivity with respect to size or stage. Studies on lotic mayflies (Ephemeroptera) have reported two direct and two indirect life history responses to increased predation risk: slower growth rate and later maturation at the same or smaller size, and faster or unaltered growth rate and earlier maturation at smaller body size. However, life history responses of standing water mayflies to predation risk are unknown. To fill this gap, we carried out a full-factorial laboratory experiment to study the influence of food availability (full/reduced) and predation risk (present/absent predator cues) by dragonfly larvae on growth and maturation of larvae of the lentic mayfly Cloeon dipterum. Males and females responded similarly to food limitation and predation risk. Predation risk had no effect on maturation size, larval mortality and metamorphic failure. However, growth rate, number of moults and development time were all affected by predation risk, and its net effect was modified by food availability and initial body size of the larvae. These results suggest that life history responses to suboptimal conditions depend on body size at the onset of such conditions. Finally, a small group of larvae grew at much slower rates and developed much longer than other individuals of similar initial size, possibly due to bet-hedging or inclusion of multiple genotypes in the experiment.

Multitrophic interactions mediate the effects of climate change on herbivore abundance								OECOLOGIA				185	2			181	190		10.1007/s00442-017-3934-0				OCT 2017	2017	Climate change can influence the abundance of insect herbivores through direct and indirect mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated multitrophic drivers of herbivore abundance for an aphid species (Aphis helianthi) in a subalpine food web consisting of a host plant (Ligusticum porteri), mutualist ants and predatory lygus bugs (Lygus spp.). We used a model-selection approach to determine which climate and host plant cues best predict year-to-year variation in insect phenology and abundance observed over 6 years. We complemented this observational study with experiments that determined how elevated temperature interacts with (1) host plant phenology and (2) the ant-aphid mutualism to determine aphid abundance. We found date of snowmelt to be the best predictor of yearly abundance of aphid and lygus bug abundance but the direction of this effect differed. Aphids achieved lower abundances in early snowmelt years likely due to increased abundance of lygus bug predators in these years. Elevating temperature of L. porteri flowering stalks reduced their quality as hosts for aphid populations. However, warming aphid colonies on host plants of similar quality increased population growth rates. Importantly, this effect was apparent even in the absence of ants. While we observed fewer ants tending colonies at elevated temperatures, these colonies also had reduced numbers of lygus bug predators. This suggests that mutualism with ants becomes less significant as temperature increases, which contrasts other ant-hemipteran systems. Our observational and experimental results show the importance of multitrophic species interactions for predicting the effect of climate change on the abundances of herbivores.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000412338900002	28891026

It causes severe fruit distortion and reduced fruit size leading into important economic losses in citrus. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is probably one of the most-used predators of mealybugs in biological control programs worldwide. However, its impact on D. aberiae is still unknown. Here, we conducted a two-year field study in nine citrus orchards located in eastern Spain in order to describe the population dynamics of D. aberiae and C. monirouzieri and evaluate the effect of the predator on D. aberiae using different approaches. Our results showed that C. monirouzieri and D. aberiae had two main synchronised population peaks per year: early spring and summer. Although D. aberiae and C. monirouzieri seasonal trends were synchronised, C. montrouzieri neither reduced mealybug density within the same year nor prevented fruit damage, which occurs early in the season. Moreover, D. aberiae population growth rates were not correlated with C. montrouzieri density. When two consecutive years were analyzed, the increase of D. aberiae in the second year was negatively correlated with the density of C. monirouzieri in summer of the previous year. Based on our two years of data, C. monirouzieri was not able to regulate D. aberiae on its own or prevent the damages produced by the mealybug but might become a valuable addition to the natural enemy guild when combined with other natural enemies and rational control measures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000483360600006

Acute changes in environmental temperature are known to impact the rate at which animals change colour, and therefore may affect their survival.Many ectotherms have the ability to acclimate performance traits such as locomotion, metabolic rate and growth rate with changes in seasonal temperature. However, it remains unclear how other functional traits that are directly linked to behaviour and survival respond to long-term changes in temperature (within an individual's lifetime).We assessed whether the rate of colour change is altered by long-term changes in temperature (seasonal variation) and if rate of colour change can acclimate to seasonal thermal conditions. We used an intertidal rock-pool goby Bathygobius cocosensis, to test this and exposed individuals to representative seasonal mean temperatures (16 or 31 degrees C, herein referred to cold- and warm-exposed fish respectively) for 9 weeks and then tested their rate of luminance change when placed on white and black backgrounds at acute test temperatures 16 and 31 degrees C. We modelled rate of luminance change using the visual sensitives of a coral trout Plectropmus leopardus to determine how well gobies matched their backgrounds in terms of luminance contrast to a potential predator.After exposure to long-term seasonal conditions, the warm-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their background more closely when tested at 31 than at 16 degrees C. Similarly, the cold-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their backgrounds more closely at 16 degrees C than at 31 degrees C. This demonstrates that rate of luminance change can be adjusted to compensate for long-term changes in seasonal temperature.This is the first study to show that animals can acclimate rate of colour change for background matching to seasonal thermal conditions. We also show that rapid changes in acute temperature reduce background matching capabilities. Stochastic changes in climate are likely to affect the frequency of predator-prey interactions which may have substantial knock-on effects throughout ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000525986000001	32227334

However, it is not yet possible to establish the extent to which non-rice plants and animal components contribute to its diet. To contribute to these issues, we studied the diet of the Bobolink found in rice fields on its wintering grounds in Santa Fe, Argentina, to provide information on (i) the composition of the diet and (ii) the relative importance of plant and animal components in the diet and of the different prey categories. We captured Bobolinks with mist nets and obtained samples of stomach contents by warm water and emetic-based regurgitation to determine the composition of the diet (n = 46 samples) and the importance of the different prey (n = 25 samples), mainly during March, just prior to northbound migration. We confirmed that the Bobolink's diet in this region during this period is predominantly herbivorous (97%) and rice-based (55%), although it also consumes a large number of seeds of non-cultivated plants that represented 42% of the diet. Invertebrates, although of less importance than plant components (3%), had been consumed by 97% of captured individuals. Our results document the importance of non-cultivated plants and animal prey in the diet of Bobolinks in addition to rice.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-5657			WOS:000475382100002

Most often, time is the parameter along which interactions evolve but any other one-dimensional gradient (temperature, altitude, depth, humidity, etc.) can be considered. These data can be modelled through a sequence of different snapshots of an evolving ecological network, i.e. a dynamic network. Here, we present how the dynamic stochastic block model approach developed by Matias & Miele (Matias & Miele In press J. R. Stat. Soc. B (doi:10.1111/rssb.12200)) can capture the complexity and dynamics of these networks. First, we analyse a dynamic contact network of ants and we observe a clear high-level assembly with some variations in time at the individual level. Second, we explore the structure of a food web evolving during a year and we detect a stable predator-prey organization but also seasonal differences in the prey assemblage.

Biological control agent selection under environmental change using functional responses, abundances and fecundities; the Relative Control Potential (RCP) metric								BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				121				50	57		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.02.008				JUN 2018	2018	We currently lack the capacity to rapidly and reliably predict the efficacy of biological control agents due to inadequate consistency in derivations of functional and numerical responses and potential effects of context-dependencies. Here, we propose and apply a novel metric, Relative Control Potential (RCP), which combines the functional response (FR, per capita effect) with proxies for the numerical response (NR, agent population response) to compare agent efficacies, where RCP = FR x abundance (or other proxies e.g. fecundity). The RCP metric is a comparative ratio between potential biocontrol agents, where values > 1 indicate higher relative control efficacy. Further, RCP can compare the efficacy of agents under environmental contexts, such as temperature change. We thus derived the RCP for two predatory cyclopoid copepods, Macrocyclops albidus (Cyclopoida: Cyclopidae) and Megacyclops viridis (Cyclopoida: Cyclopidae), towards larvae of the mosquito Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) under temperatures representative of current and future climate. Both copepods exhibited potentially population destabilising Type II FRs, with increasing temperatures inducing greater magnitude FRs through increased attack rates and decreased handling times. Attack rates by M. albidus were higher than M. viridis, yet handling times and maximum feeding rates were similar between the species across all temperatures. The inclusion of abundance data drives an elevated RCP of M. albidus and the integration of fecundity drives greater RCP of M. albidus at peak temperatures. Q(10) values are indicative of increased feeding activity by both copepods with temperature increases, however relative feeding level increases of M. viridis slowed towards the peak temperature. We present RCP calculations and biplots that represent the comparative efficacies of the two biological control agents across temperatures. The Relative Control Potential (RCP) metric thus provides a new tool for practitioners to better assess the potential efficacy of biocontrol agents before their integration into management approaches for pests, vectors and invasive species.									37	0	0	0	36	0	37			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000429777100008

Effects of Strip Tillage in Sugar Beet on Density and Richness of Predatory Arthropods								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				49	1			33	48		10.1093/ee/nvz135				FEB 2020	2020	Strip tillage, in which tillage and seedbed preparation are limited to a narrow band where the subsequent crop is planted, provides many potential agronomic benefits, including reduced fuel and labor costs, reduced erosion, and improved soil tilth. Lower soil disturbance and enhanced water retention associated with strip tillage also may affect density and diversity of predatory arthropods, which have been little studied in sugar beet. We examined the effects of tillage (conventional versus strip) on the predatory epigeal arthropod fauna in sugar beet. Studies were conducted over three growing seasons (2010-2012) in Idaho using both fenced and unfenced pitfall traps to sample arthropods. Unfenced pitfall traps often captured a greater activity density and richness of predators, and showed no bias of higher captures in conventionally tilled plots as has been shown elsewhere. Total density of predators was higher in strip tillage only during 2011. Density and species richness of carabid beetles did not differ between tillage treatments during the course of the study. Density of the other major taxa (staphylinid beetles, spiders, and Opiliones) was higher under strip tillage during some years, especially early in the season, but richness showed little or no relationship with tillage. Predaceous arthropods might be favored by enhanced ground cover, higher humidity, more moderate temperatures, and/or less habitat disturbance associated with strip-tilled plots. The results suggest that certain groups of soil-dwelling predatory arthropods can be favored by strip tillage in sugar beet, which further adds to the benefits of conservation tillage in this system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000515110400005	31838490	
J	TANAKA, K								FOOD-CONSUMPTION AND DIET COMPOSITION OF THE WEB-BUILDING SPIDER AGELENA-LIMBATA IN 2 HABITATS								OECOLOGIA				86	1			8	15		10.1007/BF00317382				1991	1991	Prey capture rate, food consumption, and diet composition of all developmental stages of the funnel-web spider Agelena limbata were estimated in woody and open habitats by a sight-count method. Prey availability was evaluated on the basis of two indices, i.e. the ratios of daily food consumption to dry weight of predator and to daily standard metabolic rate. These indices varied seasonally and between instars in this spider. Comparison of these indices between arthropod predators suggests that A. limbata live under conditions of relatively limited food supply. In the open habitat, the spiders reduced foraging activities to avoid heat stress at midday in summer because the sheet web was exposed to the direct rays of the sun and its temperature exceeded 40-degrees-C. The daily food consumption of adult spiders in the open habitat was about half of that in the woody habitat. The lower rate of energy intake of spiders in the open habitat may cause the observed smaller size of adults and lower fecundity. A. limbata captured a great range of prey comprising ten orders of arthropods and ate chemically defended insects, e.g. stink bugs, lady beetles, and ants which were rejected by many spiders. This generalistic foraging may be associated with limited and heterogeneous food supply in this spider.									23	0	0	0	21	0	23			0029-8549			WOS:A1991FD56400002	28313151

Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu were introduced into the Umpqua River in southwest Oregon in the early 1960s. The spread of Smallmouth Bass throughout the basin coincided with a decline in counts of upstream-migrating Pacific Lampreys Entosphenus tridentatus. This suggested the potential for ecological interactions between Smallmouth Bass and Pacific Lampreys, as well as freshwater-resident Western Brook Lampreys Lampetra richardsoni. To evaluate the potential effects of Smallmouth Bass on lampreys, we sampled diets of Smallmouth Bass and used bioenergetics models to estimate consumption of larval lampreys in a segment of Elk Creek, a tributary to the lower Umpqua River. We captured 303 unique Smallmouth Bass (mean: 197 mm and 136 g) via angling in July and September. We combined information on Smallmouth Bass diet and energy density with other variables (temperature, body size, growth, prey energy density) in a bioenergetics model to estimate consumption of larval lampreys. Larval lampreys were found in 6.2% of diet samples, and model estimates indicated that the Smallmouth Bass we captured consumed 925 larval lampreys in this 2-month study period. When extrapolated to a population estimate of Smallmouth Bass in this segment, we estimated 1,911 larval lampreys were consumed between July and September. Although the precision of these estimates was low, this magnitude of consumption suggests that Smallmouth Bass may negatively affect larval lamprey populations.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000407192600003

The present study was carried out to assess the performance of T. radiata, as biological control agent of D. citri, under insectary condition. The result shows T. radiata, to preferred late (4th and 5th) instar nymphs than early (1st, 2nd and 3rd) instar nymphs of D. citri, with mean parasitism rate of 0%, 0%, 43.3%, 76.9% and 86.0% for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th instar nymphs respectively. The binomial logistic regression analysis of D. citri nymphs attacked by T. radiata, as a function of host (D. citri nymphs) density offered, shows T. radiata, to display a functional response type II with attack rate of 39.99 and 34.04, and handling time of 0.60 and 0.71 for 4th and 5th instar nymphs of D. citri respectively.

J	Le Gall, Mickael; Chaput-Bardy, Audrey; Huste, Aurelie								Context-dependent local movements of the blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura elegans: effects of pond characteristics and the landscape matrix								JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION				21	2			243	256		10.1007/s10841-017-9971-5				APR 2017	2017	The loss of ponds and the fragmentation of their surrounding landscape negatively impacts the biodiversity of wetlands, such as damselflies. They are short-distance dispersers and can be influenced by the quality of suitable habitats and the landscape matrix. The aim of this study was to test the effect of the environmental context (i.e. pond characteristics and the surrounding landscape) on movements and survival probability in a damselfly species, Ischnura elegans. Three approaches (i.e. capture-mark-recapture, individual tracking and translocation studies) were performed in Northwestern France. The characteristics of ponds did not influence damselfly survival. However, the landscape context affected movements within ponds, and between ponds. Individuals from open-field ponds moved over longer distances than individuals from urban ponds. Moreover, in cases of disturbances, such as a pond drying up, movements from one pond to another were observed only in the open-field context. The ecological quality of the pond did not appear to affect survival of individuals, probably because I. elegans has a high tolerance to changes in ecological factors. However, higher local movements depend on the degree of openness of the landscape. Landscape context is hence a key issue in damselfly conservation planning and in maintaining ecological continuities, such as along greenways and blueways, and specifically the degree of landscape openness during pond creation.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1366-638X	1572-9753		WOS:000401556400006

In previous work we established that increasing temperature led to a destabilization of the population dynamics of the invertebrate carnivore Mesostoma ehrenbergii and its prey Daphnia pulex, which ultimately resulted in the local extinction of Daphnia at higher temperatures. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the population-level phenomena: (1) quantitative changes in carnivore vital rates with Increasing temperature led to stronger functional and numerical response and (2) qualitative changes in the dynamic allocation of energy to reproduction by the predator with increasing temperature introduces inverse density dependence in the predator's response.2. The growth of individual M. ehrenbergii was monitored under various food conditions to determine the effect of two temperatures (18 and 24 degrees C) and five food levels on rates of growth, prey consumption and reproduction and on reproductive allocation patterns.3. The first mechanism was supported by both higher consumption rates (stronger functional response) and faster growth rates with earlier age at maturity and shorter generation time (stronger numerical response).4. Evidence for mechanism two was also provided by an alteration of the reproductive allocation pattern with temperature. Viviparous (subitaneous) eggs were more likely to be produced by this carnivore at low food levels at 24 degrees C, while at 18 degrees C, high food levels were required before individuals made this switch. This shift actually introduces inverse density dependence in the predator's numerical response which is highly destabilizing.5. Based on the results of this study, the differential effect of M. ehrenbergii on the dynamics and structure of its D. pulex prey populations can be attributed to changes in both physiological rates and reproductive allocation patterns with temperature.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0269-8463			WOS:A1997WR93700014

Insect abundance varied seasonally in a subtropical region and also between subtropical and tropical habitats during winter, and decreased as nightly ambient temperature decreased. While capture rates of N. bifax were not affected by ambient temperatures and insect abundance, most captures occurred within one hour after sunset, which is generally the time of highest activity levels in microbats. Methods of care of N. bifax in captivity are also reported. N. bifax adapted well to short-term captivity (up to 14 days) and readily accepted mealworms as a food source.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0310-0049	1836-7402		WOS:000310034400012		
J	Zhao, Jiyan; Yang, Yangheshan; Xi, Xinqiang; Zhang, Changbing; Sun, Shucun								Artificial Warming Facilitates Growth but Not Survival of Plateau Frog (Rana kukunoris) Tadpoles in Presence of Gape-Limited Predatory Beetles								PLOS ONE				9	6					e98252	10.1371/journal.pone.0098252				JUN 6 2014	2014	Background: Global warming has been frequently demonstrated to increase growth rate in larval amphibians that have considerable phenotypic plasticity; this may lead to an increase in larval survival because large larvae are less likely to be captured by gape-limited predators. This study is to test whether warming could improve tadpole growth and thereby enhance the tadpole survival in plateau frog Rana kukunoris.Methodology: We conducted an experiment involving growing tadpoles under two contrasting temperatures, i.e. ambient temperature vs. warming by 3.8 degrees C, with and without their major predators - the gape-limited predaceous diving beetles Agabus sp. in eastern Tibetan Plateau, in a factorial arrangement. We recorded the survival and measured body fresh weight and morphological characteristics of the tadpoles.Principal Findings: Warming significantly increased body fresh weight in the presence of predators after three weeks of treatments. However, the predators imposed significant and similar effects on the survival of tadpoles under both ambient and elevated temperatures, with the effects mostly occurring in the first three weeks of the experiment. Changes in the body form, i.e. the greater whole length at a given fresh weight and the longer tail at a given body length, could have acted as mechanisms of defense and escape for the tadpoles.Conclusions/Significance: Warming did not increase tadpole survival with or without presence of predators. Moreover, an increased growth rate (due to warming in the presence of predators) was not a major factor contributing to the tadpole survival. We postulate that even if warming increases the tadpole growth rate in the plateau frog, it does not necessarily improve their survival in the presence of gape-limited predators.									7	2	0	0	8	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000341869000025	24905846

G. tuberculifemur showed a type H functional response where parasitism increased at a decreasing rate as host egg density increased from 5 to 40, reaching an asymptote of an upper limit of 9.3 host eggs within the 1-h exposure period. The instantaneous attack rate and handling time as estimated by the random predator equation were 2.28/h and 0.10 h, respectively. In contrast, G. ashmeadi showed a type I functional response where the number of hosts attacked followed a constant linear increase regardless of host density to an upper limit of 11.5 host eggs within the I-h exposure period. Female G. ashmeadi parasitized on average 4.3 and 3.5 more eggs per hour when presented with 10 and 20 H. vitripennis eggs, respectively, compared with G. tuberculifemur. When 5 or 40 H. vitripennis eggs were offered, there was no significant difference in parasitism rates between parasitoid species. Percentage of female offspring was significantly higher (5%) for G. ashmeadi compared with G. tuberculifemur. Under the experimental conditions used in these evaluations, results suggest that G. tuberculifemur is an inferior parasitoid to G. ashmeadi.									9	0	0	0	9	0	10			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000272581400015	20021759

We focus here on activity and foraging of sand vipers (Cerastes vipera (L., 1758)) (Squamata: Viperidae) in the northwestern Negev desert of Israel. Viper activity is bounded by a specific thermal range, but within this range, temperature does not affect the distance moved. Movement distances are, however, positively correlated with relative humidity. The capture success of lizards, the main prey of this viper, is strongly related both to movement distances of the snake and to the number of the lizard burrows scanned. Body size and shape have a direct effect on the number of burrows scanned and on the number of lizards captured. The increase in capture success with size is probably due to the consequent increase in the range of prey items the sand viper can subdue or handle. Vipers are larger and have a higher mass to length ratio in one of the three study sites, characterized by higher mean annual rainfall and vegetation cover. Finally, females tend to have a higher mass to length ratio than males, which may provide some space within the female body for reproductive materials such as eggs.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000267075500007

We investigated the effect of exposure to constant light versus constant dark conditions on antlion behaviour. Antlions tended to relocate less often, construct pits more frequently and construct larger pits in constant light. We interpret this as an indication of dichotomous behaviour under light versus dark conditions such that antlion larvae hunt during the day and modify their positions at night. Antlion larvae immediately responded to the complete switch in this illumination treatment and adapted their behaviour to fit the new conditions. Prey capture success did not differ between the constant light and constant dark conditions. When provided with a choice between light and dark conditions, the vast majority of larvae preferred the former. Those that preferred constant dark, however, were on average larger than those that preferred constant light. We thus suggest that since larger antlion larvae possess larger fat reserves, they can afford reductions in foraging activity ( possibly to increase safety). An examination of the antlion trade-off between their preference for light and their preference for sand depth (which may affect their ability to evade predators) showed that their response to illumination was much more prominent, irrespective of the sand depth. Finally, combining light with other factors such as temperature and density may further elucidate microhabitat selection in pit-building antlion larvae. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

J	Logan, J. David; Wolesensky, Wilmam								Accounting for temperature in predator functional responses								NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING				20	4			549	574						WIN 2007	2007	A rational mechanism that integrates temperature-mediated activity cycles into standard predator functional responses is presented. Daily temperature variations strongly influence times that predators can search for prey, and they affect the activity periods of prey, thereby modifying their detection by predators. Thus, key parameters in the functional response, the search time and the detection, become temperature-dependent. These temperature mediated responses are included in discrete-time population growth models, and it is shown how environmental temperature variations, such as those that may occur under global climate change, can affect population levels. As an illustration, a logistic growth model with a stochastic, temperature-dependent predation term is examined, and the response to both average temperature levels and temperature variability is quantified. We infer, through simulations, that predation and prey abundance are strongly affected by mean temperature, temperature amplitudes, and increasing uncertainty in predicting temperature levels and variation, thus confirming many qualitative conclusions in the ecological literature. In particular, we show that increased temperature variability increases oscillations in the system and leads to increased probability of extinction of the prey.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0890-8575	1939-7445		WOS:000251341200003

While the detrimental effects of summer heat waves have been widely studied, little is known about the impacts of winter warming on marine species in temperate regions. Many species benefit from low winter temperature-induced reductions in metabolism, as these permit conservation of energy reserves that are needed to support reproduction in spring. Here, we used a unique outdoor mesocosm system to expose a coastal predator-prey system, the sea starAsteriasand the blue musselMytilus, to different winter warming scenarios under near-natural conditions. We found that the body condition of mussels decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. Sea star growth also decreased with increasing temperature, which was a function of unaltered predation rates and decreased mussel body condition.Asteriasrelative digestive gland mass strongly declined over the studied temperature interval (catwofold). This could have severe implications for reproductive capacity in the following spring, as digestive glands provide reserve compounds to maturing gonads. Thus, both predator and prey suffered from a mismatch of energy acquisition versus consumption in warmer winter scenarios, with pronounced consequences for food web energy transfer in future oceans.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000553111800006	32673558

Emergence during the spring in cages placed over overwintered individuals occurred between 100 and 300 degree-days (DD) when temperature units were accumulated beginning 1 March. Fifty percent emergence occurred at 210 DD5degrees-C. Emergence was 2.3, 46.7, and 95.8% complete by the half inch green, pink, and the petal fall stages of 'Yorking' apple development, respectively. Most adults emerged on days of average, minimum, and maximum air temperatures of 15-20, 5-15, and 20-30-degrees-C, respectively. Temperatures in overwintering habitat were similar to ambient air temperature. Counts in the tree canopy were highly correlated with capture in the emergence cages in a warm year, but were too low to relate to capture in the other two cooler years. Capture of adults on yellow sticky boards was an efficient monitoring method; first capture occurred at 20-30% emergence. Yellow traps were more effective than white, and addition of ammonium carbonate did not significantly increase capture with yellow traps, but inhibited capture with white traps.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0046-225X			WOS:A1995QG51600018

Important to the efficiency of natural enemies is their functional response to varying prey densities. In this study, the functional response of Hippodamia variegata Goeze (Col.: Coccienllidae) to different densities of Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko was examined on two wheat cultivars with different resistance levels under laboratory conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH and 16: 8 L:D photoperiod). Our results revealed that all stages of H. variegata exhibited a type II functional response, in that predation decreased with increasing prey density. Searching efficiency (a) and handling time (Th) of third instar larvae on the Sardari cultivar were 0.0285/h and 0.0079 h, while for fourth instar larvae these values were 0.0561/h and 1 x 10(-8) h, for males these values were 0.0412/h and 0.0173 h and for females were 0.059/h and 0.0168 h. The corresponding values for the back cross cultivar for third instar larvae were 0.0475/h and 0.0782 h, for fourth instar larvae were 0.0753/h and 0.0529 h, for males were 0.045/h and 0.0060 h and for females were 0.0516/h and 0.0077 h. This study demonstrated that these wheat cultivars do not have a significant effect on the functional response parameters of H. variegata life stages, except for the searching efficiency of third instar larvae and the handling time of male adults. The possible application of this species against Russian wheat aphids in an integrated pest management programme is also discussed.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000355793300006		
J	vanZyl, A; vanderLinde, TCD; vanderWesthuizen, MC								Ecological aspects of pitbuilding and non-pitbuilding antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) in the Kalahari								AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY				4	2			143	152						SEP 1996	1996	The spatial distribution of the pitbuilding antlion Cueta sp., and the non-pitbuilders Furgella intermediat Markl and Palpares annulatus Stitz was correlated with environmental temperatures, prey abundance and vegetation, over six seasons from 1990-1992. Antlion larvae in the Kalahari migrated vertically in the sand at high sand-surface temperatures. They restricted their activity to the cooler parts of the day and were more abundant in the shade than in sunny areas. These behavioural patterns were similar to those reported for antlion species living in cooler regions. It is suggested that the depth to which the antlion larvae migrated is dependent upon prevailing environmental conditions. At high sand temperatures no differences were found between the vertical migration patterns of pitbuilders and non-pitbuilders. Prey densities and richness fluctuated between the different seasons. lt is suggested that overlap in microhabitat (preference for shade) and activity patterns of antlion larvae and their prey, enhance prey capture in myrmeleontid larvae.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			1021-3589			WOS:A1996VT61000007		
J	Plard, Floriane; Arlettaz, Raphael; Jacot, Alain; Schaub, Michael								Disentangling the spatial and temporal causes of decline in a bird population								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				10	14			6906	6918		10.1002/ece3.6244		JUN 2020		JUL 2020	2020	The difficulties in understanding the underlying reasons of a population decline lie in the typical short duration of field studies, the often too small size already reached by a declining population or the multitude of environmental factors that may influence population trend. In this difficult context, useful demographic tools such as integrated population models (IPM) may help disentangling the main reasons for a population decline. To understand why a hoopoeUpupa epopspopulation has declined, we followed a three step model analysis. We built an IPM structured with respect to habitat quality (approximated by the expected availability of mole crickets, the main prey in our population) and estimated the contributions of habitat-specific demographic rates to population variation and decline. We quantified how much each demographic rate has decreased and investigated whether habitat quality influenced this decline. We tested how much weather conditions and research activities contributed to the decrease in the different demographic rates. The decline of the hoopoe population was mainly explained by a decrease in first-year apparent survival and a reduced number of fledglings produced, particularly in habitats of high quality. Since a majority of pairs bred in habitats of the highest quality, the decrease in the production of locally recruited yearlings in high-quality habitat was the main driver of the population decline despite a homogeneous drop of recruitment across habitats. Overall, the explanatory variables we tested only accounted for 19% of the decrease in the population growth rate. Among these variables, the effects of spring temperature (49% of the explained variance) contributed more to population decline than spring precipitation (36%) and research activities (maternal capture delay, 15%). This study shows the power of IPMs for identifying the vital rates involved in population declines and thus paves the way for targeted conservation and management actions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000548017400001	32760501

I examined microhabitat preferences and the adaptive value of these preferences in the antlion larva Myrmeloen crudelis, a semisedentary insect that digs pit traps in soils to capture small arthropods. I tested the habitat preferences of M. crudelis between two soil types in a tropical dry forest of Costa Rica. Specifically, I compared the soil particle composition size within and outside antlion aggregations and manipulated the availability of fine- and coarse-grained soil to assess how differences in soil grain size affect the design and performance of larval traps. Adjacent to antlion pits the soil was composed of a greater proportion of fine- grained particles (< 2 mm) than soil 1 m away from the pits. A set of experiments demonstrated that ( 1) in the presence of equal availability of fine- and coarse-grained soils, all larvae built their pits in fine- grained soil; ( 2) the larvae required less time to start and finish traps in fine- grained soil; ( 3) the larvae constructed larger and deeper pits in fine- grained soil; and ( 4) prey capture increased greatly in fine- grained traps compared with coarse-grained traps. Antlion larvae respond to variations in the proportion of fine particles in the soil, suggesting that antlion aggregations result from an active microhabitat selection. The preference for fine- grained soils is adaptive since pits constructed in such substrate are functional for longer periods and much more successful in trapping prey than pits in coarse-grained soil. Sit-and-wait predators that use sessile traps are spatially constrained to track prey abundance. Therefore, the ability to detect and select microhabitats with better conditions that enhance capture success may be under strong selection for this type of organism.									52	1	0	0	53	4	56			0892-7553	1572-8889		WOS:000189394400004		
J	Gilbert, N; Raworth, DA								Insects and temperature - A general theory								CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST				128	1			1	13		10.4039/Ent1281-1				JAN-FEB 1996	1996	Insects are selected for slow development (but relatively fast growth) in spring, but for fast development in summer. These contrasting selection pressures explain five puzzling effects of temperature on insects: growth and development rates increase almost linearly with temperature; genetic variability in development rate is reduced at high (27 degrees C) temperatures; genetic variability in growth rate is reduced at low (15 degrees C) temperatures; development is very slow at the time of emergence after diapause, regardless of the temperature threshold for emergence; and growth is slow at low temperatures, but development is even slower.Insects use temperature to indicate time-of-season. Different species are geared differently to rising temperatures. Insect predators and parasitoids become more effective at high temperatures; and insect population dynamics are not stable in the conventional sense.									168	8	0	0	176	1	182			0008-347X			WOS:A1996UB35200001		
J	Lu, Hong-Liang; Xu, Chun-Xia; Zeng, Zhi-Gao; Du, Wei-Guo								Environmental causes of between-population difference in growth rate of a high-altitude lizard								BMC ECOLOGY				18						37	10.1186/s12898-018-0194-8				SEP 24 2018	2018	Background: Ectothermic animals living in cold (high latitude or high elevation) regions are predicted to grow slower due to limited thermal opportunities for activity and food resources than those living in warm regions. However, the Qinghai toad-headed lizards (Phrynocephalus vlangalii) grow faster and reach a larger adult size at a high-elevation site than at a low-elevation site. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic and environmental causes of this between-population difference in growth rate by conducting mark-recapture and common garden experiments on juvenile growth rate, and investigating the thermal environment, lizard body temperature, potential prey availability at the two elevation sites.Results: Compared with low-elevation individuals, high-elevation juvenile lizards had higher growth rates in the field, but grew at similar rates in the laboratory. High-elevation lizards had higher active body temperatures than low-elevation lizards despite similar air temperatures in the period of field investigation. The high-elevation site had relatively more and larger preys than the low-elevation site.Conclusions: Inter-population difference in growth rate of P. vlangalii may primarily result from developmental plasticity in response to the difference in environmental resources, rather than genetic differentiation. The higher growth rate of high-elevation lizards is likely associated with higher potential food availability and higher active body temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2				1472-6785		WOS:000445796100001	30249235

An attempt was made to set up Malaise traps to collect flying insect groups to know about their abundance and flight activity. The experiment was conducted during July 2005 - June 2006 at Annamalai University Experimental Farm, Annamalai nagar. Insect groups belonging to 15 families were collected and their abundance was correlated with weather parameters. Many insect families captured in the traps were correlated positively significant to maximum temperature and Hours of Bright Sunshine (HrBSS). Wind velocity also influenced the flight activity of the insects. Minimum temperature and rainfall had negative correlation with the capture of insect groups. Relative Humidity (RH) and rainy days had significant positive correlation with few groups of insects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0972-5210			WOS:000254833700023

Prey capture by these spiders involves a foray from a cool subterranean retreat to the undersurface of a capture web that can be lethally hot. Striking, disentangling and retrieving prey from the capture web typically involves several short trips to the capture web, alternating with retreats to the cool burrow. It has been suggested that this behavior limits the increase of body temperature a spider must experience while working at the hot capture web. We used biophysical models ih conjunction with direct observations of prey-capture behavior and distributions of sand temperature to estimate body temperatures experienced by S. henscheli during prey capture. In the circumstances we observed, only the relatively long post-strike retreat from the capture web is important in keeping spiders' body temperatures from exceeding their lethal limits. After the post-strike retreat, shuttling appreciably limits the increase in body temperature of small individuals, but may have little effect on body temperature increase in larger spiders.									14	0	0	0	14	0	15			0340-5443			WOS:A1993LP94700004		
J	Faccoli, Massimo; Bernardinelli, Iris				Faccoli, Massimo/AAC-8141-2020				Breeding performance of the second generation in some bivoltine populations of Ips typographus (Coleoptera Curculionidae) in the south-eastern Alps								JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE				84	1			15	23		10.1007/s10340-010-0320-7				MAR 2011	2011	The spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, is one of the most extensively studied European forest pests. Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.									13	0	0	0	9	0	13			1612-4758			WOS:000289850600003		
J	Rohr, DH; Malone, BS					Rohr, Detlef/0000-0001-9780-2410			Activity times and body temperature in Australian copperheads (Serpentes : Elapidae)								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				49	3			223	233		10.1071/ZO01018				2001	2001	Local climatic conditions influence the way in which ectotherms regulate their body temperature and activity. We examined correlations between local climatic conditions, body temperature and activity in adult, basking lowland copperheads (Austrelaps superbus) from two localities (warm-temperate versus cool-temperate) in south-eastern Australia. We also collected data from highland copperheads (Austrelaps ramsayi) at a locality with cold-temperate climate. We found that across the active season, mean body temperatures were similar among localities (approximately 27 degreesC) irrespective of species. In contrast, activity times differed. Cool-temperate A. superbus emerged earlier in spring and in the morning and retreated earlier in the evening and in autumn than their conspecifics from the warm-temperate locality. Spring emergence was correlated with yearly fluctuations in thermal conditions, suggesting that activity times depend on environmental temperatures. Predator-prey interactions influenced body temperature and activity to some extent in spring when warm-temperate A. superbus with relatively low body temperatures (as low as 18.5 degreesC) were captured around ponds in which they had been foraging for frogs. Austrelaps ramsayi from the cold-temperate locality not only displayed a later emergence in spring and reduced daily activity times compared with warm and cool-temperate A. superbus but also compared with A. ramsayi, as reported from a warmer locality in eastern Australia. These data indicate that activity times vary on a geographic basis while snake body temperatures largely remain inflexible. The surprising exception was that cold-temperate A. ramsayi retreated later in autumn than cool-temperate A. superbus, and at that time they showed body temperatures as low as 12.5 degreesC, well below those we had recorded for A. superbus. We suggest that A. ramsayi retreat later in autumn because they need to extend their reproductive season and that this is mediated via adaptive changes in the critical minimum body temperature, as has been reported for other snakes.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0004-959X	1446-5698		WOS:000170397000003		
J	Thessing, A								Growth and final size of Willow Tit Parus montanus under different environmental conditions								ARDEA				88	2			215	224						2000	2000	This six years study focuses on the effect of environmental factors on Willow Tit (Parus montanus) nestling growth. For each brood, nestling growth during the growth period (day 1-12) was related to the amount of food and temperature during this period as well as to the degree of synchronisation (timing) of breeding to the caterpillar peak. Food abundance was estimated from the amount of caterpillar excrements (frass) fallen from birch (Betula sp.). I also compared how growth was influenced by clutch size and hatch-day each year. The only two variables that contributed to the environmental component of tarsal growth was temperature that explained 33.2%, and relative hatch-day, which explained a further 6.0%. Temperature was the only environmental Variable that explained variance in body mass, but frass explained most when temperature was excluded from the multiple regression. Temperature may influence nestling growth both directly through thermo-regulation and indirectly by e.g. effects on insect abundance. Growth rate was shown to be higher during years with a caterpillar peak than in years lacking such a peak.									3	0	0	0	5	0	5			0373-2266			WOS:000165527100009

Mismatches can constrain individuals to complete life-cycle steps in time and in ephemeral habitats it can lead to mortality unless compensation mechanisms exist. Here we measured the performance of a population of European fire-salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) and their prey in ephemeral ponds. We analysed how short time inter-annual variability of yearly rainfall and temperature (two consecutive years, 2011 and 2012) affects matching of predator and prey and how two different weather scenarios influenced the predator's population structure. A single species (larvae of the mosquito Aedes vexans) dominates the prey community here, which occurs in high quantities only in the beginning of the season. When the occurrence of prey and predator matched during a period of sufficiently high temperatures (as in 2011), initial growth of the salamander larvae was high and population size development homogeneous. At low temperatures during matching of predatory and prey (as in 2012), the initial growth was low but the salamander larvae developed into two distinctly different sizes. Further, some individuals in the large cohort became cannibalistic and initial size differences increased. As a result, the latest (smallest) cohort disappeared completely. Temperature measurements and estimation of maximal growth rates revealed that temperature differences alone could explain the different early development between years. Our data show that weather conditions (rainfall; temperature during early growth phase) strongly determined the performance of salamander larvae in ponds. Our data also add to the match-mismatch concept that abiotic growth conditions (here: low temperature) could prevent efficient conversion of prey-into predator-biomass despite high prey availability.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0173-5373	1568-5381		WOS:000357721600001		
J	Marvin, Glenn A.; Davis, Kayla; Dawson, Jacob								Effect of acute low body temperature on predatory behavior and prey-capture efficiency in a plethodontid salamander								PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR				158				121	127		10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.02.038				MAY 1 2016	2016	The low-temperature limit for feeding in some salamander species (Desmognathus, Plethodontidae) has been inferred from field studies of seasonal variation in salamander activity and gut contents, which could not determine whether feeding is more dependent on environmental conditions influencing salamander foraging behavior or prey availability and movement. We performed two controlled laboratory experiments to examine the effect of short-term (acute) low body temperature on predatory behavior and prey-capture efficiency in a semiaquatic plethodontid salamander (Desmognathus conanti). In the first experiment, we quantified variation in the feeding responses of cold salamanders (at 1,3, 5 and 7 degrees C) to a video recording of a walking, warm (15 degrees C) cricket to determine the lower thermal limit for predatory behavior, independent of any temperature effect on movement of prey. Experimental-group salamanders exhibited vigorous feeding responses at 5 and 7 degrees C, large variation in feeding responses both among and within individuals (over time) at 3 degrees C, and little to no feeding response at 1 degrees C. Feeding responses at both 1 and 3 degrees C were significantly less than at each higher temperature, whereas responses of control-group individuals at 15 degrees C did not vary over time. In the second experiment, we quantified feeding by cold salamanders (at 3, 5, 7 and 11 degrees C) on live, warm crickets to examine thermal effects on prey-capture ability. The mean feeding response to live crickets was significantly less at 3 degrees C than at higher temperatures; however, 50% of salamanders captured and ingested prey with high efficiency at this temperature. We conclude that many individuals stalk and capture prey at very low temperatures (down to 3 degrees C). Our results support a growing body of data that indicate many plethodontid salamanders feed at temperatures only a few degrees above freezing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In laboratory conditions, we investigated the influence of two commonly used insecticides, spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin, on mortality and functional response of a community of Philodromus spiders (P. cespitum 80 %, P. albidus 20 %) at different temperatures (10, 17, 25, and 31 A degrees C). Almost all spiders died at 31 A degrees C in the lambda-cyhalothrin treatment. Mortality was very low at other temperatures. Mortality in the spinosad treatment did not differ from the control. Both pesticides reduced the prey capture rate and/or changed the type of functional response at all temperatures. The sublethal effects of lambda-cyhalothrin were most pronounced at 10 A degrees C, while those of spinosad were most marked at 10 and 25 A degrees C. At 10 A degrees C, the pesticides' effects on the spiders were long lasting. In addition, lambda-cyhalothrin influenced the philodromids much more negatively than spinosad suggesting its incompatibility with IPM across all temperatures. The results support the importance of studying the temperature-specific effects of pesticides in order to increase the efficiency of integrated pest management. Philodromids are effective in pest suppression at low temperatures, but application of pesticides at the beginning of the season can significantly disrupt their biocontrol potential.									20	1	0	0	18	0	20			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000376923400020

While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short (<1-2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long-term changes in mean annual temperature might change aphid-parasitoid population cycles, a question which we further pursued with laboratory experiments. To quantify temperature-dependent demographic parameters, we used short-term (<1 generation) experiments conducted at 20 degrees C and 27 degrees C. The higher temperature increased aphid and parasitoid development rates, adult aphid life span and fecundity, and parasitoid attack rates. We then conducted multi-generation population-level laboratory experiments to reveal the effects of temperature (20 degrees C vs. 27 degrees C) on population dynamics. We fit the resulting time series data using a nonlinear age-structured state-space model to estimate population-level processes that could not be estimated in short-term laboratory experiments. Using the model, we parsed out the demographic rates that had the largest impacts on aphid-parasitoid population cycles. This analysis showed that there were frequent contrasts in the effects of temperature operating through different demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate decreased cycle amplitude, while the increase in parasitoid attack rate increased cycle amplitude: There were also striking interactions among demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate could either increase or decrease the cycle period depending on the values of other demographic rates. Although these complexities make predictions difficult, overall they suggest that increasing long-term mean temperature will decrease the period, increase the amplitude, and tend to destabilize pea aphid-A. ervi dynamics.									20	1	0	0	15	0	20			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000340081900005

Studies on the diet of amphisbaenians suggest that most species are generalists, although others seem more selective. However, there is no information on the diet preferences of almost any species because most studies did not evaluate the availability of prey in the environment. We analysed the spring diet selection of a population of the amphisbaenian Trogonophis wiegmanni from the Chafarinas Islands, in North Africa. We specifically examined diet estimated from faecal material collected from live amphisbaenians and compared diet with the availability of invertebrates in the soil. Results indicate that the diet of T.wiegmanni amphisbaenians consists of some of the types of invertebrates that are more commonly found under rocks used by amphisbaenians, such as insect larvae, snails, isopods, beetles and ants. This diet could be initially considered generalist, and probably opportunistic. However, the comparison of proportions of prey types in the diet and those available in the habitat revealed that T.wiegmanni does not eat prey at random, but selects some particular prey types (insect larvae and pupae and, surprisingly, snails), while others (ants and isopods) are consumed less than expected by their abundance. We did not found differences between sexes or age classes in diet composition. We discuss how diet preferences could be due to selection of the more profitable or easily captured prey. There are many aspects of the feeding and foraging biology of amphisbaenians that remain unknown and further studies are clearly needed.									12	0	0	0	14	0	14			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000326284200008

This theory predicts that individuals should gain the most energy for the lowest cost in terms of time and energy when foraging, in order to maximize their fitness. However, during a foraging trip, central-place foragers could face different trade-offs during the commuting and searching parts of the trip, influencing behavioral decisions. Using the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) as an example we study the time and energy costs of different behaviors during the commuting and searching parts of a foraging trip. Lesser kestrels are small insectivorous falcons that behave as central-place foragers during the breeding season. They can commute by adopting either time-saving flapping flights or energy-saving soaring-gliding flights, and capture prey by using either time-saving active hovering flights or energy-saving perch-hunting. We tracked 6 lesser kestrels using GPS and tri-axial accelerometers during the breeding season. Our results indicate that males devoted more time and energy to flight behaviors than females in agreement with being the sex responsible for food provisioning to the nest. During the commuting flights, kestrels replaced flapping with soaring-gliding flights as solar radiation increased and thermal updrafts got stronger. In the searching part, they replaced perch-hunting with hovering as wind speed increased and they experienced a stronger lift. But also, they increased the use of hovering as air temperature increased, which has a positive influence on the activity level of the preferred prey (large grasshoppers). Kestrels maintained a constant energy expenditure per foraging trip, although flight and hunting strategies changed dramatically with weather conditions, suggesting a fixed energy budget per trip to which they adjusted their commuting and searching strategies in response to weather conditions.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000402880700016	28591181

SEASONAL SHIFTS IN THE DIET OF THE BIG BROWN BAT (EPTESICUS FUSCUS), FORT COLLINS, COLORADO								SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST				59	4			509	514		10.1894/SGM-28.1				DEC 2014	2014	Recent analyses suggest that the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) may be less of a beetle specialist (Coleoptera) in the western United States than previously thought, and that its diet might also vary with temperature. We tested the hypothesis that big brown bats might opportunistically prey on moths by analyzing insect fragments in guano pellets from 30 individual bats (27 females and 3 males) captured while foraging in Fort Collins, Colorado, during May, late July-early August, and late September 2002. We found that bats sampled 17-20 May (n = 12 bats) had a high (81-83%) percentage of volume of lepidopterans in guano, with the remainder (17-19% volume) dipterans and no coleopterans. From 28 May-9 August (n = 17 bats) coleopterans dominated (74-98% volume). On 20 September (n = 1 bat) lepidopterans were 99% of volume in guano. Migratory miller moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) were unusually abundant in Fort Collins in spring and autumn of 2002 and are known agricultural pests as larvae (army cutworms), suggesting that seasonal dietary flexibility in big brown bats has economic benefits.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-4909	1943-6262		WOS:000356940500008

In agro-ecosystems, biodiversity is usually the calculation of comparative numbers and species of organisms. Insects are the largest and most diverse group of organisms in the world. During present study, different wheat fields of district Sialkot were sampled for the assessment of diversity and relative abundance of insect fauna. Collection of insects was carried out by the sweep net technique. A total of 896 specimens of insect fauna belonging to 15 species and 9 families were collected. Overall, maximum species diversity was observed during the month of April followed by the month of March. Highest relative abundance of sampled fauna was recorded in March (37.05%) followed by April (34.37%) while it was least in June (5.80%). This variation is probably due to temporal fluctuations observed in different months during which sampling was carried out. Overall, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) or aphids was the most dominant species (17.52%) followed by Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (11.83%). The highly captured predator was C. septempunctata and prey was S. graminum. Simple linear regression showed the highest association between C. septempunctata (larva) and Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (R-2 = 0.945). The Shannon diversity index represented the significant results regarding Diversity (H'= 2.64), Evenness (E = 0.82) and Dominance (D = 0.08) of insect fauna sampled in 2017. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the significant effect of rainfall and temperature on most of the sampled species. The current study would be helpful in future for the application of species-specific biological control in wheat field that will lead towards sustainability of agro-ecosystem. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20 degrees C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P. fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F. candida, but killed F. candida when P. fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000458963200007	30303532

However, several counteracting mechanisms can buffer the effect of reduced IGP. Here, we investigated whether the cardboard bands installed in pear trees in early winter improve the suppression of the serious pest pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyre) by winter-active spiders (Anyphaena accentuate and Philodromus spp.). We also investigated in laboratory experiments whether the increased abundances of some predators (Philodromus sp.) would result in negative or positive predator-predator interactions and whether the type and/or intensity of interaction is temperature dependent. On average, pear trees with cardboard bands hosted less psylla than control trees. This pattern can be attributed to predation by winter-active spiders, as 45% of individuals were psylla positive using molecular gut-content analysis. However, 58% of Anyphaena spiders were also Philodromus positive. The suppression efficiency for psylla increased asymptotically with the increasing density of winter-active spiders. In the laboratory, the per capita capture rate of philodromids decreased with the density of conspecifics, which translated in an asymptotic increase in predation pressure on the pear psylla. Non consumptive intra-trophic-level interference was more intense at 12 degrees C than at 7 degrees C. The results show that artificially increasing habitat complexity by installing corrugated cardboard bands around the trunks and branches of pear trees increased predation pressure on the pear psylla as it most likely reduced IGP among winter-active spiders. However, increased intra-trophic-level interference due to increased abundances of spiders reduced their per capita capture rate and caused only an asymptotic increase in the overall predation pressure on the pest. The installation of corrugated cardboard bands around trees could represent an environmentally friendly management practice in fruit orchards that improves the biocontrol service provided by generalist predators.									21	0	0	0	18	1	23			0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000403033400004

Aquatic vegetation enhances structural complexity of the environment, potentially influencing predator-prey relationships. The present work characterizes fish assemblages associated with beds of Egeria, a submerged rooted macrophyte, in Rosana Reservoir, Brazil. The main subject of this study was to investigate effects of plant biomass and diel period on fish assemblage attributes (density, total weight, taxa richness and diversity), testing the hypothesis that macrophyte density and diel period greatly influences fish assemblage structure. Fishes were sampled with a 1-m(2) throw trap at morning, midday and dusk, at six sites. The assemblages were primarily composed of small-sized species (e.g. Characiformes) and juveniles, with few large species (Gymnotiformes and Cichlidae). Around 95% of the individuals were captured in habitats with medium and high vegetation biomass. Fish assemblage attributes differed significantly with respect to macrophyte biomass. Highest values of these attributes were observed in maximum plant biomass, in contrast with trends observed in previous works, where higher values (mainly of fish density) were found in intermediate plant coverage. Oxygen, temperature and pH were within normal ranges, therefore, variation in assemblage attributes is assumed to be explained primarily by plant density. No pattern of diel variation was observed, perhaps reflecting sedentary characteristics of these taxa. Results from this study illustrate that procedures to reduce macrophyte density in reservoirs of the Parana-Tiete-Paranapanema systems, may cause strong alterations in the fish assemblages, resulting in lower fish density, biomass and species richness of taxa utilizing Egeria beds.

The role of temperature in the prey capture probability of drift-feeding juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta)								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				20	3			393	399		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00470.x				SEP 2011	2011	Cold water temperatures are widely supposed to reduce the food intake of stream salmonids. Although cold temperatures have been documented to reduce swimming ability, digestion and gastric evacuation rates, little is known about how temperature influences the ability of fish to capture prey. We examined the effects of water temperature on the prey capture probability of drift-feeding juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a laboratory stream. Temperatures ranged between 5.7 degrees C and 14 degrees C. We found significant effects of water temperature on prey capture probability and capture manoeuvre time. The mean capture probability dropped from 96% at 14 degrees C to 53% at 5.7 degrees C. At 8 degrees C and higher temperatures, foraging performances did not differ much among treatments. We suggest that reduced swimming ability could be one of the most important mechanisms for the observed pattern of reduced prey capture probability at cold water temperatures, but prey detection limitations and predator avoidance may play a role. Our results will be of use for bioenergetics-based drift-foraging models, which to date have not incorporated a temperature-dependent prey capture function.									25	0	0	0	24	0	25			0906-6691			WOS:000293412600009

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY				24	4			749	759		10.1007/s10682-009-9331-3				JUL 2010	2010	In various ectotherms, it is well-known that high-latitude individuals grow faster at any temperature than do low-latitude individuals as an adaptation to shorter growing seasons. The submaximal growth of low-latitude ectotherms implies that there exist trade-offs with fast growth. Although there is accumulating evidence for latitudinal variation in growth capacity, however, few studies have demonstrated these trade-offs. In this study, using a freshwater fish Oryzias latipes as a model organism, we tested whether there is an acquisition trade-off in which the higher growth capacity of high-latitude individuals is realized by foraging more intensively, despite the risk of predation. Foraging experiments revealed that higher-latitude O. latipes juveniles captured more prey per unit time than lower-latitude juveniles at any temperature. In addition, predation experiments revealed that higher-latitude juveniles were more frequently killed by dragonfly larvae. Observations of swimming behaviors demonstrated that the higher vulnerability to predation in high-latitude O. latipes is probably caused by lower steady- and burst-swimming performances due to the larger meal size, and partially by reduced caution due to a greater willingness to forage. We conclude that acquisition trade-offs may be the primary constraint on growth evolution across latitudes among fishes. This implies that growth capacity evolves in response not only to the length of the growing season but also to predation pressures.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0269-7653	1573-8477		WOS:000278833400008		
J	Minorsky, Peter V.								The functions of foliar nyctinasty: a review and hypothesis								BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				94	1			216	229		10.1111/brv.12444				FEB 2019	2019	Foliar nyctinasty is a plant behaviour characterised by a pronounced daily oscillation in leaf orientation. During the day, the blades of nyctinastic plant leaves (or leaflets) assume a more or less horizontal position that optimises their ability to capture sunlight for photosynthesis. At night, the positions that the leaf blades assume, regardless of whether they arise by rising, falling or twisting, are essentially vertical. Among the ideas put forth to explain the raison d'etre of foliar nyctinasty are that it: (i) improves the temperature relations of plants; (ii) helps remove surface water from foliage; (iii) prevents the disruption of photoperiodism by moonlight; and (iv) directly discourages insect herbivory. After discussing these previous hypotheses, a novel tritrophic hypothesis is introduced that proposes that foliar nyctinasty constitutes an indirect plant defence against nocturnal herbivores. It is suggested that the reduction in physical clutter that follows from nocturnal leaf closure may increase the foraging success of many types of animals that prey upon or parasitise herbivores. Predators and parasitoids generally use some combination of visual, auditory or olfactory cues to detect prey. In terrestrial environments, it is hypothesised that the vertical orientation of the blades of nyctinastic plants at night would be especially beneficial to flying nocturnal predators (e.g. bats and owls) and parasitoids whose modus operandi is death from above. The movements of prey beneath a plant with vertically oriented foliage would be visually more obvious to gleaning or swooping predators under nocturnal or crepuscular conditions. Such predators could also detect sounds made by prey better without baffling layers of foliage overhead to damp and disperse the signal. Moreover, any volatiles released by the prey would diffuse more directly to the awaiting olfactory apparatus of the predators or parasitoids. In addition to facilitating the demise of herbivores by carnivores and parasitoids, foliar nyctinasty, much like the enhanced illumination of the full moon, may mitigate feeding by nocturnal herbivores by altering their foraging behaviour. Foliar nyctinasty could also provide a competitive advantage by encouraging herbivores, seeking more cover, to forage on or around non-nyctinastic species. As an added advantage, foliar nyctinasty, by decreasing the temperature between plants through its effects on re-radiation, may slow certain types of ectothermic herbivores making them more vulnerable to predation. Foliar nyctinasty also may not solely be a behavioural adaptation against folivores; by discouraging foraging by granivores, the inclusive fitness of nyctinastic plants may be increased.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000456071400011	29998471

We propose cooling events as an alternative mechanism leading to higher mortality for slower growing larvae. We observed that, in the absence of predators. slower growing pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) larvae had higher mortality compared to faster growing larvae during the unseasonably cool spring temperatures of 1998. However, this was not true for the warmer spring of 1999. Laboratory experiments showed that the probability of surviving a chill coma increased with larval mass. We propose that smaller larvae are susceptible to chilling events because they have less energy reserved for metabolism during a chill coma. and that "warm" chill events near the activity threshold may be more lethal than "cold" chill events. Weather station data since 195 1 and field data collected from 1976 to 2000 suggest that exposure to chill events below the chill coma threshold is not uncommon for these larvae. We propose that faster growth may be important for larvae because slower growing larvae remain at a chill-susceptible size for an extended period of time.									57	3	0	0	55	0	59			0012-9658			WOS:000180792700023

Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is known to prey on D. citri nymphs; we investigated the predation capacity and functional response of H. axyridis on adult D. citri. H. axyridis larvae exhibited Holling's type II functional response to different densities of adult D. citri. For second, third and fourth instar H. axyridis larvae, the successful attack rates were 0.75 +/- 0.22, 1.06 +/- 0.11, and 1.04 +/- 0.26, respectively; the handling times were 18.08 +/- 5.37, 0.45 +/- 0.07, and 0.24 +/- 0.07 h, respectively; and the estimated maximum predation rates were 4, 54, and 102, respectively. Fourth instar larvae had the lowest handling time. Adult H. axyridis consumed more D. citri adults maintained at 15-20 degrees C than at 30-35 degrees C, with an optimal temperature of 17.28 degrees C. More adults were consumed during the day than at night, with peak consumption between 12:00 and 14:00 h, not differing significantly differ between predator genders. Adult H. axyridis reared on the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum were tested for D. citri predation; these H. axyridis had successful attack rates, handling times, and estimated maximal predation rates of 0.66 +/- 0.18, 0.82 +/- 0.26 h, and 29, respectively. Conversely, those fed and tested on D. citri had corresponding rates of 0.99 +/- 0.17, 0.38 +/- 0.12 h, and 63, respectively. Significant H. axyridis predation on adult D. citri indicated its enhanced role in suppressing both nymph and adult D. citri.									0	2	0	0	1	0	2			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000458408400007

Argan fruits are frequently infested by the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata Wied (Diptera: Tephritidae). To date, no control program has been undertaken in the Argan forest. This research is the first investigation of natural mortality factors of C. capitata larvae in the Argan forest. The study was conducted at two localities near the city of Essaouira with different climatic conditions. Observations were conducted using 260 late instar larvae which were individually deposited on the ground, under fruiting host trees, where they naturally fall to find a suitable pupation site. Overall, 42% of the larvae died before being able to burrow into the ground, irrespectively of the location. Larval survival and their likelihood of burrowing decreased with increasing ground temperature, as 53% of all the larvae deaths occurred at temperatures over 48 degrees C. However, at lower ground temperature, predation by ants and spiders accounted for 47% of all mortality. Four species of ants carried out 94% of the captures. Monomorium subopacum Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), which frequently forages under Argan trees, was by far the most efficient predator, due to a powerful sting that rapidly immobilizes the prey. Our results suggest that the burrowing performance of larvae is constrained by high thermal conditions and the presence of ant predators at lower temperatures.									13	0	0	0	14	0	14			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000278497600008

To better predict effects of climate change and predation risk on prey animals and ecosystems, we need studies documenting not only latitudinal patterns in growth rate but also growth plasticity to temperature and predation risk and the underlying proximate mechanisms: behaviour (food intake) and digestive physiology (growth efficiency). The mechanistic underpinnings of predator-induced growth increases remain especially poorly understood. 2. We reared larvae from replicated northern and southern populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common garden experiment manipulating temperature and predation risk and quantified growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency. 3. The predator-induced and temperature-induced growth accelerations were the same at both latitudes, despite considerably faster growth rates in the southern populations. While the higher growth rates in the southern populations and the high rearing temperature were driven by both an increased food intake and a higher growth efficiency, the higher growth rates under predation risk were completely driven by a higher growth efficiency, despite a lowered food intake. 4. The emerging pattern that higher growth rates associated with latitude, temperature and predation risk were all (partly or completely) mediated by a higher growth efficiency has two major implications. First, it indicates that energy allocation trade-offs and the associated physiological costs play a major role both in shaping large-scale geographic variation in growth rates and in shaping the extent and direction of growth rate plasticity. Secondly, it suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food chains, where damselfly larvae are important intermediate predators, will be higher in southern populations, at higher temperatures and under predation risk. This may eventually contribute to the lengthening of food chains under these conditions and highlights that the prey identity may determine the influence of predation risk on food chain length.									58	1	0	0	58	0	61			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000307343100012	22524392

The prey species were selected from pest species syntopically occurring in stored grain habitats in central Europe. The laboratory experiments were carried out in vials containing 100 g of wheat grain and either 100 individuals of a mite pest species (Acarus siro, Aleuroglyphus ovatus, Caloglyphus redickorzevi, Lepidoglyphus destructor or Tyrophagus putrescentiae) or 50 eggs of an insect pest species (Tribolium castaneum or Ephestia kuehniella). The predatory mites were introduced at four predator-to-prey ratios: 0, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.1. The vials were maintained under optimal conditions for the pest species' development (15% m.c. and 25 degrees C), and the pest and predator densities were checked after 21 days. C. malaccensis consumed all five mite species and some eggs of T. castaneum, but not eggs of E kuehniella, suggesting a strictly acarophagous predatory habit. At low initial predator/prey ratios, the population of C malaccensis increased most on diets of C. redickorzevi, A. ovatus or L destructor, and less on diets of A. siro or T putrescentiae. The highest control efficacy was achieved on A. ovatus and L. destructor. Thus, we conclude that C malaccensis is an oligophagous predator of Acari and should be used in the control of mite pest species, particularly A. ovatus and L. destructor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of high temperatures on individuals and populations of the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum (Walker)								AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY				21	1			69	78		10.1111/afe.12304				FEB 2019	2019	Green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum is an important defoliating pest of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis that may become more damaging in the future as a result of climate change. Mild winters and higher spring temperatures increase E. abietinum population densities, although this positive response to warmer conditions might be over-ridden if E. abietinum is adversely affected by exceptionally high summer temperatures. In laboratory experiments, aphids exposed to temperatures above 25 degrees C became more restless and were more likely to drop from the shoot, and subsequently showed a reduction in mean relative growth rate. In contrast, survival was not reduced significantly unless temperatures exceeded 35 degrees C. Field data from Radnor Forest in Wales indicated that E. abietinum populations in the autumn were inversely correlated with mean and maximum summer temperatures, at temperatures below those that had a negative impact in the laboratory. The greater sensitivity of populations in the field to high summer temperatures may reflect higher temperatures at the needle surface compared with the temperature of the surrounding air, or associated increases in natural enemy activity. The results from the present study indicate that high temperatures during mid-summer have a significant impact on E. abietinum individuals and populations and, ultimately, may influence how the aphid responds to climate change.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000454811500008

The venomous Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) is a nocturnal primate endemic to the island of Java, Indonesia. It remains unknown if its venom is partially sequestered from noxious arthropod prey. We studied the little-known arthropod community in a rural agriculture system in West Java, Indonesia, in order to investigate the potential prey and source for sequestration of venom. We found specimens of the partially noxious insect orders Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera and of the class Arachnida in slow loris foraging trees in an agricultural area in West Java, Indonesia. To examine the effects of environmental conditions on the abundance of this food source, arthropods were trapped every two weeks for five months, using sweep net transects, Malaise and pitfall traps. Trap type had a significant effect on taxa caught. Wind strength negatively affected the number of Lepidoptera captured in the Malaise trap and humidity had a confounding effect on Orthoptera caught by sweep net. Despite the short-term nature of our study, by using a combination of trapping methods, we identified a relatively high diversity of insects in a human-dominated landscape. Our results can be used as a basis to understand the proximate and ultimate factors shaping the use of venom by the slow loris as a primate.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2933	1464-5262		WOS:000357665500001

Influence of prey size and environmental factors,on predation by Podisus maculiventris (Hemiptera : Pentatomidae) on viburnum leaf beetle (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae)								CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST				140	2			192	202						MAR-APR 2008	2008	Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions to determine the influence of the relative sizes of predator and prey, temperature, presence of refugia, size of the search area, and host-plant species on the predation performance of Podisus maculiventris (Say) nymphs against viburnum leaf beetle, Pyrrhalta viburni (Paykull), a new landscape pest in North America that feeds on the foliage of species of Viburnum L. (Caprifoliaceae). Predator handling time was positively correlated with body mass of the prey for all instars of P. maculiventris, but the rate of increase of handling time relative to prey mass decreased as predator age increased. Temperature was positively correlated with predation rates, but the presence of refugia did not have an impact on predation. The influence of host-plant species and size of the search area was tested on southern arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum L.) and American cranberrybush (Viburnum opulus L. var. americanum Aiton). There was a significant interaction between plant species and size of the search area, the species effect becoming significant as leaf surface area increased. In the case of southern arrowwood a negative correlation between size of the search area and predation rate was also detected. The identification of these factors adds valuable knowledge for using P maculiventris as a biological-control agent against P. viburni.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0008-347X	1918-3240		WOS:000255098000007

These data suggest that the web angle of L. regnyi is not a thermoregulatory response. In addition, prey capture efficiency of sticky traps placed at the mean angle of webs of L. regnyi is compared with traps placed at vertical and horizontal orientations in three sites in this tropical forest. Prey captured in sticky traps indicate a trend of prey availability in this ecosystem: vertically oriented traps catch fewer prey than horizontal traps or traps at the mean angle of web orientations; at sites of little or intermediate ecological disturbance, mean angle orientations catch more prey than horizontal orientations. Although confirmation that traps and spiders capture the same types of prey is lacking, it may be that in this tropical forest system, more prey are made available to spiders with horizontal and nearly horizontal web orientations than to spiders with vertical webs.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0161-8202			WOS:A1992KX18200004

To determine the effect of prey quantity and temperature on nest demography of social wasps (Polistes fuscatus ), field experiments were conducted, in which wasps were provided with a low quantity of caterpillars (approximately nest subsistence level) or high quantity (three times as much). In addition, in the third year, the nest boxes were modified to be relatively cool (white and insulated) or warm (black).2. In 1997 and 1998, high-food nests had a high proportion of cells containing developing offspring, produced more offspring, and had disproportionately more female offspring compared with low-food nests.3. In 1999, the cool and warm nest boxes exhibited a daily average difference of 1.3 degreesC and a maximum difference of 6.9 degreesC. The warm high-food nests produced more offspring than any other treatment. The cool high-food nests produced similar numbers of offspring as the cool low-food and warm low-food treatments.4. As indicated by a surplus of uncapped cells, foundresses of low-food nests, which would have had the egg-laying potential to produce many offspring, apparently sacrificed eggs to provide a food supplement for the developing offspring. This pattern plus more time observed foraging suggests considerable expenditure of energy by foundresses, in response to the low supply of food.5. Importantly, these results indicate that an interactive effect of prey quantity and temperature on offspring production occurred, which may reflect the different effects on developmental rate and growth rate at cool versus warm nest temperatures.									13	0	1	0	12	0	14			0307-6946			WOS:000183157100008		
J	Samocha, Yehonatan; Scharf, Inon								Comparison of wormlion behavior under man-made and natural shelters: urban wormlions more strongly prefer shaded, fine-sand microhabitats, construct larger pits and respond faster to prey								CURRENT ZOOLOGY				66	1			91	98		10.1093/cz/zoz006				FEB 2020	2020	Urban habitats differ from their natural surroundings in various aspects, such as a higher temperature and a distinct species composition. It is therefore not surprising that animal behavior too differs between these habitat types. We studied the foraging and habitat selection behavior of a pit-building predator, a wormlion, originating from either an urban or a more natural site. Wormlions occur in nature under structures that provide shelter from sunlight and rain, such as caves, and are also common in cities, occurring under artificial shelters. Wormlions construct pit-traps to hunt arthropods, and the pits constructed by urban wormlions were larger than those constructed by wormlions from caves. Urban wormlions responded faster to prey falling into their pit, probably leading to a higher capture success. We suggest that these 2 findings indicate the higher investment of urban wormlions in foraging, resulting from the higher abundance of potential prey in the city. Urban wormlions were choosier regarding their preferred microhabitat. While both fine sand and shaded microhabitats were preferred by wormlions, urban wormlions demonstrated a greater preference for such conditions. We suggest that relocation is more likely to lead wormlions in cities to find microhabitats of a higher quality compared with wormlions inhabiting caves. This is probably due to the larger areas in the city available for wormlions. Wormlions from the caves possessed more lipids, suggesting that they employ a conservative growth strategy, intended to contend with the uncertainty of prey arrival, in contrast to the city, where potential prey are more abundant.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1674-5507	2396-9814		WOS:000515146700011	32467709

The survival of nymphs was highest at 28 degrees C (75.57%) and at this temperature female adults O. similis had the longest oviposition period (21.1 d), the greatest fecundity (40.3 eggs) and the highest potential intrinsic rate of increase (r(m): 0.108 d(-1)). These results suggest that O. similis can maintain greater population densities at 28 degrees C than at the other temperatures tested. In addition, the functional response indicates that the attack rate of O. similis (1.04) and the maximum prey capacity (30.7 spider mites per bug in 24 h) are greatest at 28 degrees C. The results of this study provide useful information on the biology and time when to release O. similis in order to reduce the abundance of T. cinnabarinus in cotton fields.									5	3	0	0	7	0	10				1802-8829		WOS:000310716000004

For bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), this information can facilitate timing of management strategies. Our goals were to determine temperature predictors for flight initiation of three species of Ips bark beetles, five species of Dendroctonus bark beetles, and two genera of bark beetle predators, Enoclerus spp. (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Coleoptera: Ostomidae), in ponderosa pine forests of northcentral Arizona. We quantified beetle flight activity using data loggers and pheromone-baited funnel traps at 18 sites over 4 yr. Ambient air temperature was monitored using temperature data loggers located in close proximity to funnel traps. We analyzed degree-day accumulation and differences between minimum, average, and maximum ambient temperature for the week before and week of first beetle capture to calculate flight temperature thresholds. Degree-day accumulation was not a good predictor for initiation of beetle flight. For all species analyzed other than D. adjunctus Blandford, beetles were captured in traps only when springtime temperatures exceeded 15.0 degrees C. D. adjunctus was collected when maximum temperatures reached only 14.5 degrees C. Once initial flights had begun, beetles were often captured when maximum ambient air temperatures were below initial threshold temperatures. Maximum and average air temperatures were a better predictor for beetle flight initiation than minimum temperature. We establish a temperature range for effective monitoring of bark beetles and their predators, and we discuss the implications of our results under climate change scenarios.									27	0	0	0	24	0	28			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000253183300008	18348797

In accordance with these predictions, sting use by Hadrurus spadix Stahnke 1940 increased with prey size, reaching 100% once prey items were longer than the scorpion's pedipalp patella length, and with prey activity, which we manipulated by varying prey temperature. Surprisingly, the scorpions were slower to capture less active (cooler) prey than those that exhibited higher rates of activity. We suggest this is because prey are located by vibrations in the substrate, with less active prey producing fewer vibrations.									16	0	0	0	16	0	17			0161-8202	1937-2396		WOS:000275921400015

Because higher trophic levels are expected to suffer most strongly from intensification, negative consequences for ecosystem services, such as biological pest control by natural enemies, are likely. In European beech forests ambrosia beetles are common secondary pests of freshly cut wood and stored timber, but they may also infest living trees that are highly stressed.We examined whether forest management intensity, ranging from unmanaged beech forests to non-natural conifer plantations, affects the abundance, attack rate, and breeding success of ambrosia beetles across three regions of Germany. We applied pheromone trapping to estimate the abundance of ambrosia beetles and exposed experimental beech logs to measure infestation rates and breeding success.In general, we found decreasing abundance and attack probability by ambrosia beetles with increasing management intensity, which is most likely related to the availability of suitable breeding substrate. However, the abundance of the invasive species Xylosandrus germanus increased with increasing management intensity in one region, where high management intensity was represented by pine forests; the drier and warmer conditions in this forest type most likely increased population densities. Breeding success of Trypodendron domesticum increased with increasing management intensity, suggesting less effective pest control by natural antagonists, in particular by specialised parasitoids, at high management intensities.We conclude that the availability of breeding substrate, in combination with microclimate and antagonist effectiveness, shape ambrosia beetle populations in Central European forests. Forest management strategies should thus reduce the availability of breeding substrate in production forests, in particular where microclimatic conditions are favourable for beetle reproduction (i.e. warm, moist). Moreover, unmanaged forest patches should be maintained to promote parasitoid abundance and thus to mitigate negative effects of climate change, such as increasing drought stress of trees.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1127	1872-7042		WOS:000461270600012

Determining what specific benefits animals gain from kleptoparasitism could provide valuable insight into its evolution. Here, we investigate the benefits of kleptoparasitism for a population of individually recognizable and free-living fork-tailed drongos (Dicrurus adsimilis) in the southern Kalahari Desert. Drongos engaged in two foraging behaviours: self-foraging for small insects or following other species which they kleptoparasitized for larger terrestrial prey that they could not capture themselves. Kleptoparasitism consequently enabled drongos to exploit a new foraging niche. Kleptoparasitism benefitted drongos most in the morning and on colder days because at these times pay-offs from kleptoparasitism remained stable, while those from self-foraging declined. However, drongos engaged in kleptoparasitism less than expected given the overall high (but more variable) pay-offs from this behaviour, suggesting that kleptoparasitism is a risky foraging tactic and may incur additional foraging costs compared with self-foraging. This is the first study to comprehensively investigate the benefits of facultatively engaging in kleptoparasitism, demonstrating that animals may switch to kleptoparasitism to exploit a new foraging niche when pay-offs exceed those from alternate foraging behaviours.									16	0	0	0	13	0	17			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000313752300025	22943364

In the laboratory, individual larvae were placed in 9-cm petri dishes for 24 h, with 1, 3, 5, or 7 Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata [Say]) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) egg masses. Each egg mass was standardized at 15 eggs. In the greenhouse and field, C. maculata larvae were provided with an equivalent of 0.5 to 35 L. decemlineata egg masses/m(2) of potato leaf. Fourth instars of C. maculata exhibited a type II functional response to L. decemlineata eggs under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Predator search efficiency was inversely related with prey density. The maximum mean attack rate (8.7 eggs) by C. maculata larvae in the held was about half the mean attack rate in the laboratory (17.6 eggs) and greenhouse (20.1 eggs). The difference in prey density between the laboratory and held seems to have been a major contributing factor in determining the rate of predation, whereas differences in environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and possible alternate food) may explain the differences observed in the predation rate in the greenhouse and field.

J	Hernandez D, John; Sarmiento, Carlos E.; Fernandez H, Claudio								Foraging activity of Polybia occidentalis venezuelana (Hymenoptera, Vespidae)								REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE ENTOMOLOGIA				35	2			230	234						JUL-DEC 2009	2009	In order to characterize some aspects of foraging in Polybia occidentalis venezuelana in the region of Monteria (Cordoba), observations were made over 20 hours at six nests located in three zones of vegetation. The number of wasps departing and returning to the nest was recorded from 07:00 to 19:00 hours and the solid food brought to the nest was identified. The range of foraging was estimated. High temperatures and low relative humidities positively influenced the departure frequency of foragers from the nest. Foraging for liquid constituted 53% of the events, while foraging for food was 18.5% and pulp for nest construction was 12.8%. Prey items consisted of Lepidoptera (58.5%), Diptera (20.5%), Hemiptera (6.7%), Coleoptera (2.7%), and Hymenoptera (2.1%). Spodoptera frugiperda was the more frequent species; the remaining 9.2% constituted unidentified material. The flight range of P. occidentalis venezuelana was about 50 m, resulting in a main foraging area of 7,854 m 2. On average a colony captured 72 prey per day and an adult lifted up to 39% of its own weight on each trip. The diet described for this species, as well as the foraging range, coincide with studies conducted in other regions and highlight the potential of Polybia occidentalis venezuelana for biological control programs in agroecosystems of the Cordoba department.									3	0	0	0	5	1	6			0120-0488			WOS:000273409800020

The cloudless sulphur Colias eurytheme/ philodice was always more palatable than the cabbage white Pieris rapae and the western white Pontia occidentalis. Pontia and Pieris had similar palatabilities when demand for resources by the nestlings was relatively low. When demand fcr resources increased at the height of the birds' breeding season, the palatabilities of all three species increased, Moreover, Pontia was eaten more frequently than Pie-is, although the difference was not significant. Differences in palatability among species were associated with differences in capturability in artificial predation experiments. Colias flew for greater durations and distances than the other species prior to capture. The three species did not differ in flight speed. However, Colias was missed more often; suggesting that the species differed in manoeuverability. Two indicators of flight performance in tropical butterflies, flight muscle ratio (thoracic mass/body mass) and the position of centre of body mass, ordered with capturability of these temperature species as predicted.

J	GILLER, PS; SANGPRADUB, N								PREDATORY FORAGING BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF LARVAE OF 2 SPECIES OF LIMNEPHILID CASED CADDIS								OIKOS				67	2			351	357		10.2307/3545482				JUN 1993	1993	Temporal feeding behaviour, locomotory activity patterns and functional responses of larvae of two species of cased caddis were investigated in the laboratory. The temporal pattern of locomotory activity of both Poramophylax cingulatus (Stephen) and Halesus radiatus (Curtis) was examined under constant conditions of 12 h light/12 h darkness, continuous light and continuous darkness. Larvae of both showed a similar endogenous rhythm of activity consistent with the species being nocturnal and were most active at night during a 4 h period (2000-2400 h). They also demonstrated a greater consumption of prey at night and under the continuous darkness conditions. This feeding activity pattern appears to be based primarily on intrinsic predator activity patterns rather than generated as a response to prey activity.The response of larvae of the two species to a range of prey densities (Baetis rhodani (Pictet) nymphs and Orthocladinae chironomid larvae) was monitored in the laboratory in a weak current under ambient temperature and light conditions. Fourth and fifth instars of H. radiatus and fifth instars of P. cingulatus demonstrated sigmoid Type Ill functional responses. For both species a threshold density (15/20 prey/arena -56cm2) was evident above which the predator was able to increase its predation rate considerably, H. radiatus showed a higher attack rate. Fifth instar H. radiatus also showed a trend for higher attack rate than fourth instars. Both species are generally considered detritivorous, but they demonstrated strong predatory behaviour in their penultimate and final instars in the laboratory. The Type III functional responses shown by the two species are theoretically potentially stabilising in nature, thus these caddis larvae could play a more significant role in macroinvertebrate communites than generally considered.									21	0	0	0	21	0	22			0030-1299			WOS:A1993LF01600020

We investigated how a heat wave influenced growth rate and investment in two immune components (phenoloxidase activity and melanin content) in larvae of two damselfly species, Ischnura elegans and Enallagma cyathigerum. Late instar larvae were kept at 18 degrees C (i.e. their average natural water temperature) or under a simulated long heat wave at 30 degrees C. To explain the heat wave effects, we quantified traits related to energy uptake (food intake and growth efficiency), energy expenditure (metabolic rate measured as activity of the electron transport system, ETS) and investment in energy storage (fat content). The two species differed in life strategy, with I. elegans having a higher growth rate, growth efficiency, ETS activity and fat content. In line with its preference for cooler water bodies, the heat wave was only lethal for E. cyathigerum. However, both species benefited from the heat wave by increasing growth rate, which can be explained by the higher increase in food intake than metabolic rate. This may also have contributed to the increased investment in energy storage and immune components under the heat wave. This mediatory role of food intake indicates the critical role of food availability and behaviour in shaping the impact of heat waves. Our results highlight the importance of including behavioural and physiological variables to unravel and predict the impact of extreme climate events on organisms.									5	1	0	0	3	0	5			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000414145900016	28839009

J	Hosono, Shouhei; Nakamura, Jun; Ono, Masato								European honeybee defense against Japanese yellow hornet using heat generation by bee-balling behavior								ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				20	1			163	167		10.1111/ens.12248				JAN-DEC 2017	2017	The Japanese honeybee, Apis cerana japonica Radoszkowski, uses unique generation of heat by bee-balling to defend against, overheat and kill predacious Japanese hornets. We have now observed the European honeybee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, using similar bee-balling behavior and heat generation against the Japanese yellow hornet, Vespa simillima xanthoptera Cameron. We monitored temperatures in the center of the bee-ball and inside thoracic muscles of the captured hornet and found that the thoracic internal temperature (45.8 +/- 2.32 degrees C) was higher than that of the bee-ball (44.0 +/- 0.96 degrees C). Although the thoracic temperature of captured hornets rose to the upper lethal level, defending European bees also showed some stinging attempts against the hornet, unlike the sympatric Japanese honeybee, which never stings during bee-balling. The European honeybee bee-balling behavior consists of three phases: (i) heating; (ii) heat-retaining; and (iii) break up. Our results suggest that European honeybees kill hornets by raising the body temperature of hornets rapidly without stinging. The tactics of bee-balling against hornets are complex and may be performed by extended division of labor.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1343-8786	1479-8298		WOS:000396406800022

Diets, population structure, and seasonal activity patterns of mudpuppies (Necturus maculosus) in an urban, Great Lakes coastal habitat								JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH				43	1			132	143		10.1016/j.jglr.2016.11.004				FEB 2017	2017	Freshwater species native to the Laurentian Great Lakes region face numerous environmental stressors, and the conservation status and ecological relationships of many remain poorly understood. One such species, the mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus), is declining, but better information on their natural history and development of more effective population monitoring techniques is needed. We assessed seasonal variation in capture success, biases in capture techniques, and feeding ecology of mudpuppies in Wolf Lake, a highly perturbed and urban former estuarine wetland complex to Lake Michigan. Trapping periods of >= 3 consecutive nights occurred from January to May 2015, and October 2015 to March 2016. Overall trapping success differed among trapping periods (p = 0.01) and declined precipitously at water temperatures above 14.1 degrees C (p < 0.001). Mudpuppies in traps (mean 26.9 +/- 0.5 cm) were larger than those caught with hand nets (mean 14.7 +/- 0.8 cm, p < 0.0001), suggesting that multiple methods may be needed to accurately assess demographics. Stomach contents obtained through gastric lavage included mollusks, leeches, insects, isopods, amphipods, crayfish, fish, a frog, and a juvenile conspecific. Invasive species, including rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), and zebra/quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) were present in guts, suggesting mudpuppy foraging has changed along with aquatic communities in the region. Prey community analyses revealed differences in overall diet among size classes of mudpuppies (p = 0.001), but relatively weak similarity within size classes. Results suggest that mudpuppies in lake ecosystems occupy a broad niche that changes as they grow. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Causes and Consequences of Cannibalism in Noncarnivorous Insects								ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY		Annual Review of Entomology		55				39	53		10.1146/annurev-ento-112408-085314				2010	2010	We review the primary, literature to document the incidence of cannibalism among insects that typically are not carnivorous. Most of the cannibalistic species were coleopterans and lepidopterans, and the cannibals often were juveniles that aggregate or that overlap in phenology with the egg stage. Cannibalism can be adaptive by improving growth rate, survivorship, vigor, longevity, and fecundity. It also can play an important role in regulating population density and suppressing population outbreaks, stabilizing host plant-insect relationships, and reducing parasitism rates. Cannibalism often was favored by density-dependent factors for herbivores that feed in concealed feeding situations (Such as stein borers, leafminers), but also by density-independent factors (such as high ambient temperature) for herbivores that feed in exposed feeding situations.									104	5	0	0	96	0	113			0066-4170		978-0-8243-0155-2	WOS:000273712100003	19961322

Some lepidopteran species have larvae that live gregariously, especially in early instars. Colony-living species may benefit from improved protection from predators, thermoregulation, and feeding facilitation, for example.2. While many studies have compared solitary and gregarious life styles, few data exist as to the relationship between size of the larval colony and larval performance in gregarious species. The present study was aimed at understanding the importance of colony size for growth and survival of the northern pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pinivora) larvae.3. Field studies, comparing three different sizes of colonies of T. pinivora larvae, showed that individuals in larger colonies had a higher survival rate compared with those living in smaller colonies and also a faster growth rate.4. The higher survival rate of large colonies was attributed to improved protection from predacious arthropods.5. In early spring, the young larvae bask in the sun to increase their body temperature. In field experiments the thermal gain was higher in large colonies, and individuals in such colonies also grew faster. As growth rate was not affected by colony size when the ability to bask was experimentally removed in a laboratory experiment, the higher growth rate of the larger colonies was probably due to improved thermoregulation rather than feeding facilitation.6. The size of larval colonies of gregarious insects depends on natural mortality events as well as on female oviposition strategy. Our results show that decreasing colony size can lead to a reduction in growth rate and survival. It is therefore important to understand whether or not small colonies will benefit equally from the gregarious behaviour.									23	1	0	0	20	0	23			0307-6946			WOS:000279440900004

Predators were starved for 24 h, and single predators were exposed to different prey density treatments. Predation response was observed at 6, 12, and 24 h after feeding trials began. At the highest prey density (150 eggs per predator), Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville and Collops quadrimaculatus (F.) adults and Chrysopa oculata Say larvae showed the highest consumption rates (116, 85, and 119 eggs/24 h, respectively), followed by H. convergens larvae (51 eggs/24 h), adult Geocoris punctipes (Say) (45 eggs/24 h), and adult Scymnus loewii Mulsant, Orius insidiosus (Say), Notoxus spp., and Nabis capsiformis Germar (1, 1, 10, and 12 eggs/24 h, respectively). Adult Notoxus spp., N. capsiformis, and O. insidiosus showed type 1 functional response, whereas adult C. quadrimaculatus, G. punctipes, H. convergens, and larval H. convergens and C. oculata showed type 2 response. All predators consumed the highest number of bollworm eggs at 35 degrees C and the lowest numbers at 15 degrees C; predation rate at 35 degrees C was four times higher than that at 15 degrees C. The prey density-dependent behavior of predators and effect of temperature on their predation behavior are discussed.									42	2	0	0	39	0	45			0046-225X			WOS:000236865500025

Scymnus species belong to a poorly known Coccinellidae group of biological control agents. In this study we aimed to evaluate the suitability of Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Aphis fabae Scopoli and Melanaphis donacis (Passerini) (Homoptera: Aphididae) as prey for S. subvillosus. To achieve this, we determined (i) the temperature and prey-dependence for development and survival of the immature stages, (ii) the prey-dependence for reproductive performance at 25 A degrees C and (iii) the voracity and nutritional physiology of the 4th larval instar fed on A. fabae. The development time from first instar larva to adult decreased with increasing temperature, ranging from 61.5 days at 15 A degrees C to 10.4 days at 30 A degrees C. To complete immature development on M. donacis, the lower development threshold (LDT) was estimated to be 11.7 A degrees C and the sum of effective temperatures (SET) to be 196.3 degree-days (DD). At 15 A degrees C, larvae failed to develop when fed on A. fabae or M. persicae but on M. donacis 22 % of the larvae survived. We also found that development time of immature stages was prey-dependent, with M. persicae being the least suitable prey. The reproductive parameters were prey-dependent, with A. fabae and M. donacis allowing better performance than M. persicae. Twelve-hour-old 4th instars of S. subvillosus ingested 3.23 mg of biomass per day corresponding to an average of 10.5 aphids of A. fabae, allowing for a daily mean weight gain of 0.71 mg. The conversion efficiency and relative growth rate obtained were approximately 21 and 48 %, respectively. The results obtained in the present study suggest that both A. fabae and M. donacis are more suitable prey for development and reproduction of S. subvillosus than M. persicae.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000351531400010

We collected 2910 mosquitoes, 77 biting flies, 704 ticks, 115 mammals, and 1911 aquatic invertebrates in 2013-2014. Real-time PCR on all mosquitoes, 40 biting flies, 113 aquatic invertebrates, and 650 ticks did not detect F. tularensis DNA. Indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on 109 mammals revealed 2 (of 2, 100%) seropositive feral cats, 1 (of 24, 4.5%) seropositive black rat, and 5 (of 10, 50%) seropositive Virginia opossums. A riparian reserve, similar to 1 km from the primate research center, had the highest seroprevalence in mammals and the highest capture success for invertebrate vectors whereas opossums, cats, and ground squirrels in close proximity to the primate center had high seroprevalence and abundant fleas. Well-vegetated regions with standing water appeared to be ideal habitats for biotic components of tularemia enzootic persistence. Mesocarnivores may facilitate the spread of F. tularensis, and high densities of rodents and their fleas may be a mechanism for amplification and spillover.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-3667	1557-7759		WOS:000413641400005	28968195

Field experiments were completed in which the physical dimensions of patches infested with cereal aphids, cereal aphid density, and access to patches by coccinellids were varied. Aphid infestations consisted of naturally occurring densities (natural patches) and much greater densities created by supplementing patches with aphids (supplemented patches). Coccinellids were denied access to some supplemented patches (exclusion patches) but allowed unlimited access to others. Densities of adult Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septem-punctata were correlated with aphid density in patches whereas density of Coleomegilla maculata was not. Aggregation by coccinellids was independent of patch area. The realized aphid population growth rate (r) was lower in supplemented than natural patches in all four trials but was significantly lower in only one trial. The lower r in supplemented patches was not exclusively caused by coccinellid predation, and emigration of aphids from patches probably also contributed, r was significantly greater in exclusion patches than supplemented and natural patches, indicating that coccinellids markedly reduced aphid numbers in patches even when aphid density was extremely high.									30	1	0	0	31	0	32			1438-3896			WOS:000088009000012		
J	Ferguson, SH; Joly, DO								Dynamics of springtail and mite populations: the role of density dependence, predation, and weather								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				27	5			565	573		10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00441.x				OCT 2002	2002	1. Ecological theory suggests that density-dependent regulation of organism abundance will vary from exogenous to endogenous factors depending on trophic structure. Changes in abundance of soil arthropods were investigated at three trophic levels, springtails (Collembola), predaceous mites (Acari), and macro-arthropods (spider, adult and larval beetles, centipedes). Predictions were that springtails are predator regulated and mites are food limited according to the Hairston et al . (1960) model, which predicts alternating regulation by competition and predation from fungi to springtails to mites to macro-arthropods. The alternate hypothesis was based on the bottom-up model of trophic dynamics, which predicts that each trophic level is regulated by competition for resources.2. The relative contributions to springtail and mite population dynamics of endogenous (i.e. density-dependent population growth related to food availability) and exogenous (i.e. predation and weather) factors were tested using time-series analysis and experimental manipulation of water conditions. Box patterns were distributed within an aspen forest habitat located in the Canadian prairies and surveyed weekly from May to September 1997-1999. Each box depressed the leaf litter, creating a microhabitat island for soil arthropods that provided counts of invertebrates located immediately beneath the boxes.3. Strong evidence was found for endogenous control of springtail and mite numbers, indicated by a reduction in population growth related to density in the previous week. Contrary to predictions, no evidence was found for regulation of springtail numbers by mites, or for regulation of mite numbers by macro-arthropods. Springtail population growth rate was related positively to current springtail density (8 and 23% variation explained) and related negatively to 1-week lagged density (85 and 58%), and related negatively to temperature (5 and 5%) for time-series data and for experimental addition of water respectively. Mite population growth rate was related positively to current mite density (54%) and temperature (4%), and negatively to 1-week lagged mite density (20%) and precipitation (6%) for time-series analysis. For experimental addition of water, mite growth rate was related positively to current mite density (44%) and temperature (5%), and negatively to 1-week lagged density (11%). Results differed from the Hairston et al. (1960) model predictions but were consistent with a bottom-up view that springtail and mite populations were regulated intrinsically by competition for food and secondarily by temperature as a function of reproduction.									35	1	1	0	31	0	39			0307-6946			WOS:000177834300007

Because spiders are ectothermic animals, the temperature regime of the microhabitat in which an individual finds itself may affect important performance traits of that individual, The present study examined the effects of temperature on attributes of webs spun by Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. Koch), as well as testing temperature preference in this species. The effects of temperature on the amount of silk per web produced by Achaearanea tepidariorum and the prey-capture efficiency of webs produced at different temperatures were determined by using webs constructed at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. The temperature preferences of A. tepidariorum within a thermal gradient were also determined,2. Web mass was related to temperature, exhibiting a quadratic relation with a maximum web mass occurring at approximately 20 degrees C.3. Number of strands per cm(3) of webs varied directly with web mass; webs with greater strand densities were more efficient at capturing flies.4. The number of spiders observed in each temperature range in the thermal gradient indicated a non-uniform distribution, with the spiders avoiding temperatures in the highest range (27.3 +/- 2.0 degrees C).5. These data suggest an optimal temperature for web construction at which webs produced are more efficient at capturing prey. The data also suggest that this species may avoid sites that do not provide an adequate thermal environment.									25	2	0	0	26	0	29			0269-8463			WOS:A1997WR93700001

P. truncatus exhibited a bimodal pattern of flight activity with a major peak between 18.00 and 21.00 h, and a smaller peak between 07.00 and 09.00 h. The effective life of the pheromone bait was also investigated over 33 days. The highest numbers of P. truncatus were caught during the first 8 days and the majority of the beetles were caught within 14 days. Catches then showed a steady decline. Captures of the predatory histerid Teretriosoma nigrescens Lewis, were much lower than those of P. truncatus and showed fluctuations which did not appear related to numbers of its prey. Environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, wind and trap positioning appeared to influence results, especially when considered over a short time scale.									18	0	0	0	18	0	18			0013-8703			WOS:A1993KP39000011

The predatory caddisfly Rhyacophila vao Milne (Rhyacophilidae) displayed a 2-year, semivoltine life cycle in a small, spring-fed stream in southern Alberta, Canada. Three overlapping cohorts were identified throughout the 2-year sampling program, with five larval instars recognized. Larvae overwintered in instars I-III, developed to instar IV by summer and instar V by autumn. The second winter was spent in instar V. Pupation occurred from late May to August and did not commence until stream temperature exceeded 3-degrees-C. Adults were collected from mid-June to early September.2. Larvae displayed a diphasic growth pattern: Phase I, a positive, non-linear growth rate for instars I-IV; Phase II, a constant growth rate during instar V. Phase I coincided with increasing stream temperatures in late winter and spring, where mean instantaneous growth rates (maximum of 2.78% dry wt day-1) were significantly correlated with stream temperatures. Although the duration of Phase II spanned a temperature range similar to that in Phase I, the instantaneous growth rate remained temperature-independent at 0.87% dry wt day-1.3. Larvae exhibited a type III survivorship curve (i.e. an exponential decrease on an arithmetic scale), with the finite rate of mortality averaging 0.80% larvae day-1.4. Cohort 1 (later part of 1983 year class) displayed lower total production compared with the equivalent growth phase in the 1984 year class (Cohort 2). In contrast, production of the non-linear and linear growth phases of Cohort 2 was similar. Periods of similar growth characteristics for Cohorts 1 and 2 had comparable P/B ratios for both the unadjusted and time-adjusted annual estimates, although higher ratios were observed for the non-linear growth phase of Cohort 2. Total cohort production (linear + non-linear growth phases) could only be calculated for Cohort 2, and was 870.2 +/- 1011.4 mg dry wt m-2. The corresponding cohort P/B ratio was 5.01 and the adjusted annual P/B, 3.01.5. Annual larval production (+/- SE) for the first and second years of the study was similar (Year 1, 480.0 +/- 387.5 mg dry wt m-2; Year 2, 526.9 +/- 967.5 mg dry wt m-2) as were unadjusted and annual P/B ratios.									8	0	0	0	9	0	9			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:A1992HQ36000001

Notwithstanding, the three social species of Stegodyphus (Eresidae) inhabit arid and semi-arid habitats with marked daily and seasonal variation in climate. The nests of the social spider Stegodyphus mimosarum Pavesi commonly occur in dry Acacia savanna in southern Africa. We investigated the abiotic conditions to which the nests of S. mimosarum are exposed and the changes in availability of potential insect prey at different times of year and over the daily cycle. We used these data to determine the:extent to which prey availability and climatic conditions explain seasonal and daily variation in the activity of the spiders. Data were collected during four sampling periods a year over two years from nests of S. mimosarum located on the Mkomazi River Bridge (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). We measured ambient and nest temperatures and in a sample of nests, spider growth rate, prey availability, foraging activity and activity on the web at night. Spiders had two periods of increased growth rate occurring in early and late summer, at times of year when ambient temperature rarely falls below 20 degrees C. Temperatures inside the nest were generally higher than ambient throughout the day and night. Foraging response, measured as the numbers of individuals responding to the vibrations of a tuning fork, was significantly higher by night than by day. In summer, foraging response decreased with increasing temperature during the day, whereas in winter, there was a positive correlation between foraging response and temperature at night. Potential prey, measured as mean numbers of insects trapped in a sample of webs, were more abundant during the day than at night, despite the fact that the spiders were most active on the web at night. Nocturnal insects, however, were larger than diurnal. ones and spiders handled significantly more large prey both during the day and at night. Correlation and partial correlation analyses indicate that ambient temperature and windspeed play a direct role in influencing foraging and other activity on the web. Nonetheless, the predominance of nocturnal activity in both summer and winter could not be explained by climatic conditions and prey availability alone. Some other factor (e.g., predation or parasitism) may be involved.									28	0	0	0	28	1	31			0161-8202			WOS:000089802200004

JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY				74				181	186		10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.024				MAY 2018	2018	Wormlions are sit-and-wait insect predators that construct pit-traps to capture arthropod prey. They require loose soil and shelter from direct sun, both common in Mediterranean cities, and explaining their high abundance in urban habitats. We studied different aspects of thermal acclimation in wormlions. We compared chill-coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat-shock recovery time (HSRT) of wormlions from urban, semi-urban and natural habitats, expecting those originating from the urban habitat to be more heat tolerant and less cold tolerant. However, no differences were detected among the three habitats. We then examined whether maintenance temperature affects CCRT and HSRT, and expected beneficial acclimation. However, CCRT was unaffected by maintenance temperature, while temperature affected HSRT in an opposite direction to our prediction: wormlions maintained under the higher temperatures took longer to recover. When testing with two successive thermal shocks, wormlions took longer to recover from both cold and heat shock after applying an initial cold shock. We therefore conclude that cold shock inflicts some damage rather than induces acclimation. Finally, both cold- and heat-shocked wormlions constructed smaller pits than wormlions of a control group. Smaller pits probably translate to a lower likelihood of capturing prey and also limit the size of the prey, indicating a concrete cost of thermal shock. In summary, we found no evidence for thermal acclimation related either to the habitat-of-origin or to maintenance temperatures, but, rather, negative effects of unfavorable temperatures.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0306-4565			WOS:000436526200024	29801625	
J	Zhao, Jiyan; Yang, Yangheshan; Xi, Xinqiang; Sun, Shucun								Artificial warming increases size at metamorphosis in plateau frogs (Rana kukunoris) in the presence of predators								AQUATIC ECOLOGY				48	4			423	434		10.1007/s10452-014-9495-y				DEC 2014	2014	Global warming may induce significant changes in species life history traits particularly in amphibians, which are characterized by complex and plastic life cycles. Because both warming and predators are often suggested to reduce size at metamorphosis in amphibians, we hypothesized that the size at metamorphosis was further reduced by experimental warming in the presence of predators. We conducted a factorial-designed experiment involving two factors and two levels (warmed vs. ambient, lethal predator absence vs. presence, resulting in four treatments) using Rana kukunoris tadpoles in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and we examined its behavioral, growth, and developmental responses to warming in the presence and absence of predatory beetles (Agabus sp.) for 13 weeks. During the course of the experiment, a similar level of tadpole mortality due to the diving beetles was found between ambient and warmed treatments, but the warming effect on size at metamorphosis depended on whether the predators were present or absent. In the absence of predators, warming did not significantly increase tadpole growth but advanced the timing of metamorphosis, such that size at metamorphosis of forelimb emergence and tail resorption was much reduced in terms of body fresh weight. In the presence of predators, warming increased tadpole growth rate much more than the development rate (as reflected by duration of the tadpole stage), and therefore the size at metamorphosis was significantly increased. The significant effect of the interaction between predator and warming on the size at metamorphosis could be attributed to the tadpole response in the frequencies of feeding, resting, and swimming to the predator activity level, which was in turn increased by warming. We suggest that warming-induced changes in life history traits should be studied in relation to species interaction so as to accurately predict ecological response of amphibians to the future warmed world.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1386-2588	1573-5125		WOS:000344800800006

However, detailed field observations that describe how lepidopterans are hunted by wild birds are quite limited. I observed foraging behavior of wild tree sparrows on adult lepidopterans from May to June 2006 at Mt Yoshida, Kyoto, Japan. A total of 253 foraging attempts on at least 14 species of lepidopterans were observed. The tree sparrows attacked both resting and flying lepidopterans. When a tree sparrow approached a resting lepidopteran, the lepidopteran frequently flew to escape predation. The number of feeding attempts for resting and flying lepidopterans was 215 and 38, respectively. This result indicates that resting lepidopterans are the main target of predation by the tree sparrow. It is therefore considered that reducing the risk of detection is important for lepidopterans to avoid predation by the tree sparrow. Coloration as crypsis is probably effective in this respect.									3	0	1	0	3	0	4			1343-8786			WOS:000289254200007

Mark-recapture studies show that M. viridis adults are rarely recaptured. Experiments exposing adults and immatures to ambient fall and winter temperatures in the Upper Piedmont of South Carolina resulted in the death of all adults by December, but 33% of the larvae emerged as adults the following spring from late February through May. The ability to survive prolonged freezing weather as immatures inside spider egg sacs may allow M. viridis to inhabit the colder regions of its range.									1	0	0	0	1	0	2			0749-8004			WOS:A1995QG92200013

The planktivorous fish, sunbleak (Leucaspius delineatus, 4.9 individuals m(-3)) was introduced into a half of mesocosms after the first sampling of zooplankton to compare daphnid life-history traits with and without fish predators. Our results showed selective fish predation on the daphnid females with advanced developmental stages of embryos. The Daphnia populations exposed to fish exhibited a lower proportion of females with advanced embryos over those with earlier embryonal stages. Fish predators obviously were attracted to more visible females bearing larger embryos, with well-developed pigmented eyes. Simultaneously, we found a smaller daphnid body length in the mesocosms with fish than in those that were fishless. However, the daphnid clutch size did not reflect their body-length pattern and, surprisingly, decreased regardless of fish presence or absence since the first sampling day, probably owing to deterioration of food quality (mean seston carbon : phosphorus ratio similar to 238). Nevertheless, this selective elimination of the females with advanced embryos, together with the overall decrease in daphnid fitness, can strengthen the deceleration of its population growth under fish predation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000526573200009

Because the dam drains off surface water the temperature is increased downstream. The accumulated annual temperature above 12 degrees C, the threshold for larval moulting, was 2400 degree-days in the natural stream, but 3300 degree-days downstream of the dam. Although the density of small prey (< 0.8 mm in width) was lower below the dam, large prey density (> 0.8 mm width) which is the important prey category for this size-selective predator did not differ between the two streams. The larval period was 2 years in the natural stream. However, it was reduced to 1 year, and slightly smaller adults emerged, below the dam. Thus, temperature greatly affected the larval growth rate of P. immaculatus, and slightly altered their body size at maturity.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0165-0424			WOS:A1996UL62700003

Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations < 2 mg L-1. However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.									16	0	0	0	10	0	16				2296-7745		WOS:000462731700001

As a step towards more thoroughly understanding the behaviour and predatory biology of this species, here we provide baseline information about development. During its development, there are 5 instars, with the 4th instar being the longest. The length of the 4th instar was consistent with this species' phenology in the field and corresponds to the winter months. Mortality during the 4th instar was higher than in any other instar. Sexes were similar in size until the 5th instar (width across eyes was greater for males than for females, a pattern continued into the adult stage). Overall, adult females tended to be larger than males. The growth rate between instars varied according to instar, although the transition from 5th instar to adult was generally associated with a decrease in growth rate compared with other transitions. Width across the eyes was the only metric that exhibited a sex difference in growth rate, with males growing more than females during the transition from 4th to 5th instar.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-959X			WOS:000261890000006		
J	Stamp, NE; Yang, YL; Osier, TL				Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011				Response of an insect predator to prey fed multiple allelochemicals under representative thermal regimes								ECOLOGY				78	1			203	214						JAN 1997	1997	We examined the effects of three allelochemicals found in tomato (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21 degrees:10 degrees C and 26 degrees:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer, respectively) on the performance of a generalist insect predator (Podisus maculiventris: Pentatomidae) fed prey containing those allelochemicals. The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that the effects of these thermal and dietary conditions were distinctly different for prey and predators, which suggests that such conditions would promote developmental asynchrony between prey and predator populations.									28	0	0	0	26	2	29			0012-9658			WOS:A1997WD34500016

We found complicate life cycle consisting of two cohorts for Leuctra prima with growth rate positively correlated to photoperiod length. Isoperia sudetica showed an univoltine life cycle. The annual secondary production of the stonefly community was reaching 4304 mg DW m(-2). It was mainly related to the abundance of three dominant species - I. sudetica, L. prima and Protonemura intricata - and to the permanence of their nymphs in the water through the whole year. We suppose that the stable thermal regime is a factor which could allow high production and biomass values, irrespective of seasons. Nymphs of I. sudetica passed from gatherer-collector to predator and nymphs of L. armata passed from gatherer-collector to shredder during their development. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we examined how one of Japan's endemic crustaceans, Daphnia tanakai, which has been found only in alpine lakes and pools in high mountain moors, is adapted to the alpine environment and what restricts its distribution only to the alpine environment. Lab experiments on UVB tolerance and growth rate under different pH and temperature based on the field survey for pools in mountain moors revealed that D. tanakai was differentiated from two low-altitude species (Daphnia dentifera and Daphnia pulicaria) by its tolerance to low pH such as 4.5, which is equal to the mean pH of pools in the high mountain moors occupied by D. tanakai. The growth rate at pH 4.5 was, however, significantly lower than that at higher pH, suggesting that low pH was not necessarily an optimal condition, and that other factors restrict the distribution to alpine lakes. Vulnerability to invertebrate predators such as Chaoborus was suggested as such a factor by additional experiments on swimming activity and predation and the fact that D. tanakai has only been found in pools without Chaoborus. Because it is known that the pH of alpine lakes is tightly linked with temperature, global warming may diminish the advantage of D. tanakai and allow invasion of alpine lakes by unwelcome predators and competitors from lower altitudes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000393804600013		
J	Croteau, MN; Hare, L; Tessier, A								Influence of temperature on Cd accumulation by species of the biomonitor Chaoborus								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				47	2			505	514		10.4319/lo.2002.47.2.0505				MAR 2002	2002	We exposed larvae of several species of the phantom midge Chaoborus to the trace metal cadmium (Cd) to determine whether Cd accumulation rates varied with ambient temperature. Because this predator is known to accumulate its Cd mainly from food rather than from water, we presented the Cd in food, that is, Cd-rich copepods taken from a lake near a metal smelter. Rates of Cd accumulation by larvae of Chaoborus americanus, C flavicans, and C. punctipennis were measured at three temperatures (5, 14, and 22degreesC) covering the seasonal range encountered by these animals. The rates at which all species accumulated Cd increased with temperature. To explain these results, we fit our experimental data to a bioaccumulation model that allowed us to estimate Cd assimilation efficiency, Cd-efflux rate, and larval growth rate. Temperature-related changes in Cd accumulation rates were best explained by changes in the rate at which Chaoborus larvae ingested prey as well as the efficiency with which they assimilated Cd from their food. Neither the rate of larval growth nor the rate at which larvae lost Cd was influenced by temperature. Extrapolations of our laboratory results to the field suggest that our model results provide a realistic representation of the processes involved in Cd accumulation by larvae of this common aquatic insect.									28	0	0	0	24	0	28			0024-3590			WOS:000174751100015

Blowfly larvae were used as bait along the canopy openness gradient (forest interior, forest edge, base of a solitary tree and meadow) and the attack rate was assessed after 30 min of exposure. Although the predation rate has a varying pattern throughout the year in different habitats, in contrast to previous studies, we observed a significant positive trend in predation rates toward the forest interior. A significant trend in predation rate was not observed in non-forest areas. We found that the trend was strongly influenced by ants as the most active taxon of predators (65%) attacking our baits, whereas ground beetles, the second-most active predators (21%), showed the opposite trend along the canopy openness gradient.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1895-104X			WOS:000309685100009

J	Linn, Catherine Anne; Griebeler, Eva Maria								Habitat Preference of German Mantis religiosa Populations (Mantodea: Mantidae) and Implications for Conservation								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				45	4			829	840		10.1093/ee/nvw056				AUG 2016	2016	In Germany, the thermophilic European mantid (Mantis religiosa L.) is endangered. Here, we study habitat requirements during its life, and discuss the applicability of the two conservation measures grazing and mowing to this insect species. At two study sites in south-western Germany, which were each subject to one of these measures, we recorded structural and climatic conditions within different microhabitats. We also conducted capture-mark-recapture studies for adult M. religiosa, and mapped adult roosting, oothecae deposition, egg hatching, and imaginal molting in microhabitats over two vegetation periods. In order to assess microhabitat preference of M. religiosa during its life, and identify climatic conditions driving preferences, we applied the Lille habitat preference index and conducted logistic regression analysis for life phases. Our results suggest that temperature is important for egg and nymph development. For egg deposition, females preferred solid substrates with high heat-storing capacities, as those attenuate the negative influence of cold weather periods on egg development. Being ambush predators, males and females preferred roosting sites with sufficient shelter and high prey abundance. Contrary to our expectation, the conservation measures reduced adult population sizes, and presumably reproduction rates. We thus suggest that mowing during the adult phase should reduce vegetation height to a moderate level to keep prey abundance high. Mowing with a clearing saw or grazing over a short period in small fenced areas should be preferred over prolonged grazing, as grazers collaterally stamp down the vegetation. Grazers indirectly reduce prey availability by deteriorating prevailing microclimatic conditions.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000381911600007	27271947	
J	Ovadia, Ofer; Scharf, Inon; Barkae, Erez David; Levi, Tanya; Alcalay, Yehonatan								Asymmetrical intra-guild predation and niche differentiation in two pit-building antlions								ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION				66	1-2	SI		82	90		10.1163/22244662-20191067				DEC 2019	2019	Co-occurring species often compete with each other directly and indirectly. Intra-guild predation (IGP) is an extreme manifestation of direct competition, which involves the attack, killing and eating of potential competitors. We studied the competitive interactions between two pit-building antlion species that co-occur in the Israeli desert: Myrmeleon hyalinus residing in the more productive sandy soil, and Cueta lineosa solely inhabiting poorer loess soils. To understand the mechanisms driving C. lineosa away from the more productive habitat, we explored the factors triggering IGP of one antlion species on the other. We tested whether IGP is affected by soil type, depth and temperature. IGP was asymmetrical with M. hyalinus preying on C. lineosa, and it intensified as the size difference favoring the former increased. Interactive rather than additive effects governed IGP, which was lowest in sandy soil combined with low temperature, and highest in shallow loess soil. C. lineosa possesses a smaller head and thorax relative to its abdomen compared to M. hyalinus, providing a possible explanation for the advantage of M. hyalinus in direct competition. We then focused on the weaker competitor, C. lineosa, examining how it copes with competition induced by M. hyalinus. Both the growth and survival rates of C. lineosa declined in the presence of M. hyalinus. The asymmetrical IGP C. lineosa experiences from M. hyalinus combined with its competitive inferiority may explain why it is mostly found in poor habitats, while its intra-guild competitor is abundant in the more productive habitats.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1565-9801	2224-4662		WOS:000569014800011

Its invasion has an important socio-economic impact because it preys upon honeybees (Apis mellifera) and other crucial insect pollinators. The dispersal of this species must be monitored to minimise the damage it causes and to take the necessary control actions. The aims of this study were to determine target and nontarget living organisms captured by bait trapping and to compare the distribution patterns of V. velutina and the autochthonous V. crabro. Altitude and weather conditions played important roles in hornet behaviour. The traps placed in low-altitude coastal areas contained the most yellow-legged hornets. In contrast, the autochthonous hornet occurred in relatively greater numbers in the traps hung in high-altitude areas. High minimum temperatures, dew temperature, relative humidity and low maximum temperatures favour the occurrence and spread of V. velutina. These conditions are common in the coastal areas of this territory and promoted the rapid dispersal of this pest. The traps used were not bait-selective, so many other arthropod organisms were captured along with the hornet. Therefore, the use of species-selective baits is required for the ecofriendly effective management of this insect pest.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000463146700016

Predation risk elicits phenotypic and behavioral changes that likewise impact performance measures. We tested whether exposure to predation Orthocyclops modestus impacts the maximum population growth rate (r(max)) TPC of the protist Paramecium aurelia. We fit predator and non-predator exposed P. aurelia population growth rates to a function previously shown to best describe Paramecium population growth rate TPC's (Lactin-2) and compared subsequent parameter estimates between curves. For Paramecium exposed to predation risk, maximum population growth increased more rapidly as temperatures rose and decreased more rapidly as temperatures fell compared to the initial temperature. The area under each TPC curve remained approximately the same, consistent with the idea of a trade-off in performance across temperatures. Our results indicate TPCs are flexible given variation in food web context and that trophic interactions may play an important role in shaping TPCs. Furthermore, this and other studies illustrate the need for a mechanistic model of TPCs with parameters tied to biologically meaningful properties.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			1674-5507	2396-9814		WOS:000383737600010	29491939	
J	Hoback, WW; Higley, LG; Stanley, DW								Tigers eating tigers: evidence of intraguild predation operating in an assemblage of tiger beetles								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				26	4			367	375		10.1046/j.1365-2311.2001.00333.x				AUG 2001	2001	1. Co-occurrence of closely related predators in a prey-limited habitat appears to contradict the principle of competitive exclusion, however it may be explained through indirect effects, niche shifts, and intraguild predation.2. The interactions between sympatric tiger beetle Cicindela species were examined. Cicindela circumpicta is the largest of three species (C. circumpicta, C. togata, C. fulgida) found in saline habitats throughout central North America. The temporal occurrence of these species overlaps, as does their spatial occurrence on exposed salt flats of saline marshes. During field observations, exoskeletal remains of C togata were found at the study site in Nebraska, U.S.A.3. In laboratory trials, male C circumpicta ate C. togata in 38% of trials and female C circumpicta ate C. togata in 50% of trials (n=24).4. In the field, potential prey, consisting mainly of small flies, was found mostly in shaded conditions but tiger beetles differed significantly in shade use, with C. circumpicta spending 70% of the time in the shade compared with approximate to 20% for C. togata. Differential habitat use was not explained by maximum temperature tolerances, which did not differ between the species.5. Laboratory trials established that both tiger beetle species consumed small prey (apterous Drosophila) but C. togata was more efficient at capturing winged Drosophila.6. Foraging efficiency, as measured by the time taken for a C. togata to capture three prey items, decreased significantly in the presence of other tiger beetles, especially C. circumpicta.7. These results are an indication that intraguild predation and induced changes in foraging behaviour operate in the ecology of adult tiger beetles.									9	0	0	0	13	0	13			0307-6946			WOS:000171023100004

Peak densities in the spring were from 70 +/- 17 to 532 +/- 143 aphids per square meter, which is 40-100 times lower than reported in the United States. Spatial variation in D. noxia density was strong at the scale of tillers and 1-m(2) quadrats. Predator density and parasitism varied greatly among fields and sample dates. At the scales of fields and 1-m(2) quadrats, predator density correlated positively with D. noxia density. When D. noxia population growth rate over each sample interval in each field was regressed stepwise on plant maturity, rainfall, temperature, and the densities of D. noxia, parasitoids, and predators, the only variable included in the regression model was predator density. D. noxia population growth rate declined with predator density, suggesting that predators limited D. noxia abundance.									24	0	0	0	23	2	26			0046-225X			WOS:A1997XU11900017

In contrast, adult, sexually mature anadromous charr did not appear to feed during their freshwater residency. The stomach fullness of post smolts were similar to that of resident Arctic charr during early autumn, and their diets were similar, being dominated by pelagic prey such as surface insects, Holopedium sp., Bosmina sp. and chironomid pupae. Later in the autumn, the resident charr also included some more benthic prey, in particular gastropods, whereas the post smolts continued to feed predominantly on zooplankton and surface insects, but with a lower stomach fullness than the resident fish. This suggests that after arrival in freshwater, the post smolts continue their pelagic feeding behaviour displayed during the sea-migration.									25	0	0	0	24	0	25			0906-6691			WOS:000180927000004

There was no difference among aphid clones in development rate, but they did differ in fecundity. Both development rate and fecundity were influenced by temperature, but all clones showed similar responses to the changes in temperature (i.e. the interaction term was nonsignificant). However, there were significant differences among clones in susceptibility to the pathogen, and this was influenced by temperature. Furthermore, the clones differed in how temperature influenced susceptibility, with susceptibility rankings changing with temperature. Two clones showed changes in susceptibility which mirrored changes in the in vitro vegetative growth rate of E. neoaphidis at different temperatures, whereas two other clones differed considerably from this expected response. Such interactions between genotype and temperature may help maintain heritable variation in aphid susceptibility to fungal pathogen attack and have implications for our understanding of disease dynamics in natural populations. This study also highlights the difficulties of drawing conclusions about the efficacy of a biological control agent when only a restricted range of pest genotypes or environmental conditions are considered.									37	0	0	0	34	1	38			0307-6962	1365-3032		WOS:000183310800002

The entomological exogenous variables considered relevant for malaria incidence have been collected from laboratory experiments and field data (indoor and outdoor captures). The parasite transmission between linking mosquitoes and vertébrate host populations during a blood meal has been represented usina three infectious disease models: the Entomological Inoculation Rate, the Basic Reproduction Rate and the Vectorial Capacity for diverse vector density scenarios. Considering a breeding place availability model and several predator-prey-food models allow us to represent the vectorial densities fluctuations observed during the fields campaigns. The comprehensive model has been applied to represent malaria incidence during the period Nov/1997-Feb/2001 (40 months, 1200 days simulation period), when both El Niño and La Nina events strongly affected the hydro-climatology of Colombia. The model has been run for observed climatic patterns such as mean daily temperatures, total daily precipitation records, and mean daily relative humidities gathered by a nearby climatological station. Diverse temperature scenarios have been considered to deepen the understanding of the entomological-climatic linkages conductive to malaria outbreaks. Sensitivity analysis and instabilities cases have been also studied during the experimentation-validation processes. Obtained results allow us to conclude that the model constitutes a promising tool to deepen the understanding of the ecological, entomological, and epidemiológica! linkages conductive to malaria outbreaks.	Se ha desarrollado un modelo matemático en dinámica de sistemas para representar las interacciones entomológicas, epidemiológicas y climáticas de la transmisión de la malaria que conducen a brotes epidémicos de la enfermedad en el municipio de Nuquí, departamento del Chocó, sobre la costa pacífica colombiana. Las variables entomológicas exógenas consideradas relevantes para la representación de la incidencia han sido estimadas a partir de bioensayos y campañas de colecta de adultos (peri e intradomiciliarias). La transmisión del parásito entre las poblaciones de mosquitos y humanos durante la alimentación sanguínea ha sido representada a través de tres índices: Tasa de Inoculación Entomológica, Tasa Básica de Reproducción y Capacidad Vectorial, bajo diferentes escenarios de densidad de mosquitos. La representación de la fluctuación estacional de los vectores ha sido posible gracias a la implementación de dos módulos paralelos adicionales: disponibilidad de criaderos e interacciones predador-presa-recursos. El modelo ha sido aplicado para el período nov/1997-feb/2001 (1.200 días de horizonte de simulación), durante el cual los eventos El Niño y La Niña afectaron la hidroclimatología del país. El modelo se ha ejecutado para temperaturas y humedades relativas promedio diarias, así como valores totales diarios de precipitación registrados por una estación climatológica cercana. En el proceso de experimentación se consideraron diferentes escenarios de temperatura, además de los análisis de sensibilidad e inestabilidad. Los resultados obtenidos permiten concebir el modelo como una herramienta para el entendimiento de las relaciones ecológicas, entomológicas y epidemiológicas que conducen a los brotes epidémicos de la enfermedad.								2	0	0		1	1	3			0120-0488			SCIELO:S0120-04882003000200012

The duration of total pre-adult stage was found to decrease with increase in temperature from 60.0 days at 20 degrees C to 15.3 days at 35 degrees C. The oviposition period lasted 58.5, 44.7, 53.2 and 24.5 days at 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively, with females laying an average of 164.8, 415.2, 660.4 and 136.6 eggs, respectively, at these four temperatures. Life table data were analyzed using an age-stage, two-sex life table. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m) = 0.1540 d(-1)), finite rate of increase (lambda = 1.1666 d(-1)) and net reproductive rate (R-0 = 197.9 offspring) were greatest at 30 degrees C. The shortest mean generation time (T = 30.6 days) was recorded at 35 degrees C. These results indicate that N. arcuatus can successfully survive and reproduce at temperatures of around 30 degrees C and has the potential to be an effective biological control agent of N. viridis and other mealybugs in warm regions.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3				1802-8829		WOS:000343664100006		
J	Wintzer, AP; Motta, PJ								The effects of temperature on prey-capture kinematics of the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus): implications for feeding studies								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				82	5			794	799		10.1139/Z04-061				MAY 2004	2004	Research with ectothermic organisms has demonstrated that temperature is positively correlated with an individual's power output during locomotion. This study investigates the effect of temperature on another aspect of power output, prey-capture kinematics, of the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). Feeding sequences for two treatments of four sunfish were filmed at three temperatures (18, 24, and 30 degreesC) with one treatment (A) experiencing an increasing range of temperatures and the other (B) experiencing a decreasing temperature range. Directional temperatures affected prey-capture kinematics. The time required to achieve maximum lower jaw depression and maximum gape, as well as the duration of maximum gape, time to close the mouth (from the point of maximum gape), and the total bite duration, increased as water temperature decreased. In addition, both the time to maximum gape and the time to maximum lower jaw depression were longer at 18 degreesC for individuals in treatment A than those in treatment B. These results indicate that water temperature can bias the results of feeding studies employing kinematics that do not control for its effects as well as those that make comparisons across such studies which utilize different temperatures and taxa.									17	0	0	0	18	0	18			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000225021400015

Assessment of variations in biology and life-history traits of insects along geographical gradients is important for a successful management plan in different regions. We investigated life-history traits and life table parameters of M. domestica from six different geographical regions of Punjab, Pakistan: Rahim Yar Khan (RYK), Bahawalpur (BWP), Multan (MTN), Lahore (LHR), Gujrat (GJT), and Murree (MRE). Overall, M. domestica from localities of lower latitude and elevations with higher mean temperatures completed their development faster than those from localities of higher latitude and elevations with lower mean temperatures. The immature developmental time was the longest for the MRE population that was collected from higher latitude and elevation with cooler climate, whereas the shortest for the RYK population from lower latitude with warmer climate. Pupal weights were heavier for the RYK, BWP, and MTN populations, all were from the lowest latitude and elevations with warmer climate, compared with rest of the field populations. Similarly, rate of adult eclosion, fecundity, egg hatching, longevity, and life table parameters such as intrinsic rate of population increase, mean relative growth rate, net reproductive rate, and biotic potential were significantly higher for the RYK, BWP, and MTN populations compared with the GJT, LHR, and MRE populations of M. domestica. The current results will probably be of importance when planning management of M. domestica in different geographical regions of Pakistan.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-2585	1938-2928		WOS:000492054500010	31081906

If invasive species become abundant, changes in prey availability may be particularly harmful to specialist predators. The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile Mayr, is an important invasive species on nearly all continents. Spiders of the genus Zodarion are specialised ant-eating predators native to the Mediterranean yet it is unknown if they can exploit invasive ant species. Here we studied spatial and temporal abundance of this invasive ant and the native spider, Zodarion cesari Pekar, during 4 years in four citrus groves. Circadian activity of both spiders and ants, and capture efficiency and prey specificity of the predator were also evaluated. The abundance of Z. cesari was strongly correlated to L. humile abundance. The predatory activity of spiders varied seasonally with differences on the relative frequency of spiders capturing ants depending on the time of the year. In laboratory, Z. cesari displayed most efficient capture upon the native ant Tapinoma nigerrimum (Nylander) and the invasive ant L. humile in comparison with five other native ant species. These results demonstrate that the native spider Z. cesari is successfully exploiting the invasive ant species L. humile and is likely a locally monophagous predator. We suggest that Z. cesari shifted away from native T. nigerrimum post invasion as both ant species are phylogenetically related and of similar size.									7	1	0	0	7	0	7			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000312140800008

In ectotherms, anthropogenic warming often increases energy requirements for metabolism, which can either impair growth (when resources are limiting) or lead to higher predator feeding rates and possibly stronger top-down trophic interactions. However, the relative importance of these effects in nature remains unclear because: (1) thermal adaptation or acclimation could lower metabolic costs; (2) greater prey production at warmer temperatures could compensate for higher predator feeding rates; and/or (3) temperature effects on trophic interactions via altered biological rates could be small relative to other, temperature-unrelated human impacts on food webs.2. Here, we examined effects of deforestation-associated warming on the minnow Enteromius neumayeri, occurring in both forested (cool) and deforested (warm) streams located inside or nearby an afrotropical rainforest. Combining approaches from physiological and community ecology, we quantified impacts of anthropogenic warming on the metabolism, growth and trophic interactions of this tropical ectotherm. We then compared these effects with impacts of land use unrelated to temperature.3. In a long-term laboratory acclimation experiment quantifying the temperature dependence of growth and metabolism in E. neumayeri, warming increased metabolic rates and decreased growth (at a limited ration). We found no evidence of local (thermal) adaptation, with warming affecting farm and forest populations similarly.4. Then, using mark-recapture methods to quantify impacts of warming on performance in situ, we found similar growth rates in fish from deforested and forested streams despite their distinct thermal environments. This suggests higher prey consumption at deforested sites to compensate for greater metabolic costs, which could strengthen fish-invertebrate interactions.5. Finally, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate fish-invertebrate interaction strength and quantify temperature-related and unrelated impacts of land use on this interaction. We found that although warming increased fish consumption, it apparently increased invertebrate production even more and thus had a net-weakening effect on estimated interaction strength. Most importantly, variation in both fish and invertebrate density not directly related to temperature had a much stronger influence on estimated interaction strength than temperature effects on predator consumption and prey growth.6. We conclude that ectotherms can sometimes offset the metabolic costs of warming with a small increase in consumption that hardly effects food web interactions compared to non-metabolic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances. Future research should assess whether this is a common feature of heavily impacted ecosystems facing multiple stressors.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000431991700019

The study of the long-term variation in the composition of their communities was stimulated by recent dramatic changes in the abundance of some species. We review and evaluate possible effects of the main causes cited in the literature. Agricultural and habitat changes (particularly urbanization) affect coccinellid abundance, both negatively and positively. In the temperate zone dominant species occur most frequently associated with abundant prey populations on crops, weeds and planted stands of trees resulting from human activity. Invasive non-native species of coccinellids may endanger native species through intraguild predation or competition for resources, but their supposed serious negative effects on native species can differ considerably. Climatic change may influence coccinellid species in several ways, including indirect effects through lower trophic levels and desynchronisation of the phenologies of host plants, prey and coccinellid populations. In the near future we do not expect climate warming to have important effects on ladybird diversity globally, but local changes in the composition of coccinellid communities and abundance of particular species could occur.									23	0	0	0	19	0	25			2214-5745	2214-5753		WOS:000403060200012	28602237

Entomological captures were performed in 10 selected districts of the city, between September 2002-August 2003. A total of 773 specimens of L. longipalpis were captured in the period and the population density could be associated with local climate variables (cumulative rainfall, average temperature and relative humidity) through a mathematical linear model with a determination coefficient (Rsqr) of 0.752. Although based on an oversimplified statistical analysis, as far as the vector is concerned, this approach showed to be potentially useful as a starting point to guide control measures for AVL in Montes Claros.									19	0	0	0	11	8	19			0074-0276	1678-8060		WOS:000274413300020	20140384

In this study, we investigated how rising temperatures alter larval interactions between a naturally range-expanding dragonfly, Crocothemis erythraea, and a native northern European species, Leucorrhinia dubia. Initial studies revealed that C.erythraea grow up to 3.5 times faster than L.dubia at temperatures above 16 degrees C. As a result, we hypothesised that divergent temperature responses would lead to rapid size differences between coexisting larvae and, consequently, to asymmetric intraguild predation at higher ambient temperatures. 2.Mortality and growth rates were measured in interaction treatments (with both species present) and non-interaction controls (one species present) at four different temperature regimes: at an ambient temperature representative of central Germany, where both species overlap in distribution, and at temperatures increased by 2, 4 and 6 degrees C. 3.The mortality of C.erythraea did not differ between treatment and control. In contrast, mortality of L.dubia remained similar over all temperatures in the controls, but increased with temperature in the presence of the other species and was significantly higher there than in the controls. We concluded that L.dubia suffered asymmetric intraguild predation, particularly at increased temperature. Reduced growth rate of L.dubia in the interaction treatment at higher temperatures also suggested asymmetric competition for prey in the first phase of the experiment. 4.The results imply that the range expansion of C.erythraea may cause reduction in population size of syntopic L.dubia when temperature rises by more than 2 degrees C. The consequences for future range patterns, as well as other factors that may influence the interaction in nature, are discussed.									16	0	0	0	17	0	19			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000316286700007

This lizard is linearly distributed along water courses, where it carries on most activities in well-lit, warm microhabitats. Activity does not occur on days with cloud cover. Late morning and midday activity predominates on sunny days. Body temperatures of active lizards were 35.9 +/- 0.37 degreesC (mean +/- SE) and were higher than substrate or air temperatures at the point of capture and higher than overall temperatures in the habitat. Although a variety of prey types are eaten, spiders, grasshoppers and crickets, roaches, and insect larvae dominate the diet. Larger lizards eat larger prey but also include small prey in their diets. Absolute and relative prey sizes were greater for lizards at the Rio Ituxi than for those in Rondonia, but lizard stomachs were equally full, suggesting that prey types available varied between sites. Males reach larger body sizes than females and have relatively larger heads. Although K. altamazonica is similar in ecology to other Amazonian Kentropyx species, it is more closely associated with water than the others.									14	0	0	0	14	2	16			0008-4301			WOS:000172265900013

The sensitivity of each method to changes in variances was examined with computer simulation. The results showed that when error variances are proportional to the number of prey attacked, the Woolf transformation is effective in both linearizing the disk equation and reducing correlations between the variance and the mean, thus yielding the best estimates. When error variance is constant, nonlinear regression provides the best estimates. Under both circumstances, estimates by the proportional I (Holling's proportional method) and proportional II transformations are biased, because of correlated error terms. Estimates by the Lineweaver-Burk transformation have the least accuracy. Reanalysis of 22 data sets from the literature revealed that the Woolf transformation yielded better parameter estimates than nonlinear regression in 13 cases. Nonlinear regression yielded better estimates in two cases and tended to overestimate one of the parameters. The estimates of the other seven cases were similar between the two methods. We recommend that the Woolf transformation be used for estimating parameters of the Holling's disk equation instead of nonlinear regression.									36	1	0	0	36	5	39			0046-225X			WOS:A1994PC62800002

Link. Forests of Turkey in 2006 to 2009. Average number of I. sexdentatus was statistically different between years and average annual highest number of captured beetles showed differences according to regions. The averages of the numbers of beetles caught in two different altitudes in two separate years are statistically different. In higher altitudes, average number of beetles caught per trap was higher. Provided data showed that I. sexdentatus has at least 2 generations in the forests of the region. First adult flight ranged from end of April to mid-June in both altitude steps, while second flight started in mid-June and continued until the mid-September. It was concluded that the beetles that were caught during fourth week of August and first week of September were the adults that would start a third generation. The predator species Thanasimus formicarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) was caught in the pheromone traps as well as I. sexdentatus. In each trap, an average of 43.92 I. sexdentatus adults was captured per 1 T. formicarius adult. A total of 18 I. typographus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) adults were captured by 5 traps containing Tryphreon Ipstyp aggregation pheromones. The trapping works in the research region have once again detected the existence of this species, which has densities that cannot be detected by other methods, and which is very dangerous for spruce stands since the first detection 75 years ago.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1684-5315			WOS:000298557500031

Effect's of initial aphid density, temperature and a predator on the population dynamics of A. gossypii under controlled laboratory conditions were studied. The three factors had major and interacting effects on most population parameters measured. Temperature and the initial density of aphids were key drivers of population dynamics with predation playing a role, except at the lowest temperature of 18 degrees C. The most suitable condition for the total aphid population size was the temperature of 24 degrees C. The population size declined at higher temperatures (27-30 degrees C). Obtained results suggest that if aphids experience temperatures around 24 degrees C for several weeks during the cotton-growing season, an outbreak is possible. Monitoring of aphids early in the cotton-growing season, maintaining natural predators and accurate weather forecasts are important tools for management of A. gossypii.									2	1	0	0	2	0	3			1110-1768			WOS:000368323300019

The present study was performed to determine the relationship between growth rate and temperature effects on S. pygmaeus. Development and fecundity were investigated at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 +/- 1 degrees C and 60%+/- 10 relative humidity with 16 hours lighting in a growth chamber.The development time from egg to adult decreased with increasing temperatures. The longest development time was at 15 degrees C with 147.3 +/- 4.37 days and the shortest time was at 30 degrees C with 21.8 +/- 0.20 days, while development was not completed at 35 degrees C. The oviposition period was 22.00 +/- 4.22, 19.58 +/- 1.37 and 2.38 +/- 0.14 days at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. When the temperature effects on body size and weight of female and male individuals were compared, they were slight differences in size and weight at the same temperatures. Males and females reared at 25 degrees C were bigger than specimens reared at other temperatures. Daily and total egg production was highest at 25 degrees C, with 11.9 +/- 0.80/female/day and 258.4 +/- 12.25 per female. The net reproductive rate (R-o) and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) were highest at 25 degrees C at 109.31 females/female and 0.1235 females/female/day(-1), respectively, and average generation time (T-o) was lowest at 30 degrees C at 23.49 days.									4	1	0	0	4	0	6			1010-6960			WOS:000302335000002

Modified Malaise traps were used to sample the adult flies within the greenhouses, accompanied by direct sampling of syrphid larvae on the sweet plants. Over 2-yr period, modified Malaise traps also were used to record the movement of syrphids into the greenhouses from the surrounding environment. Additionally, the effect of opening or closing the side walls of the greenhouse (ventilation management) on syrphids was assessed by census techniques. In total, nine species of aphidophagous syrphids were found as larvae, preying on aphids on sweet pepper plants. Three of these species, Eupeodes corollae (F.), Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), and Sphaerophoria rueppellii (Wiedemann), made up 98% of the larvae collected. There was a temporal succession during the season, attributed to temperature, and variability among years related to drought. S. rueppellii seems to be the most adapted to survival in the high temperatures and dry conditions. Modified Malaise traps proved effective for monitoring adult syrphids in greenhouses, but they also captured species whose larvae are not associated with the aphid colonies in sweet pepper. This indicates that when studying aphidophagous syrphids, sampling of adults by Malaise trap should be accompanied by sampling of larvae. Larger numbers of syrphids were captured outside of the greenhouse than inside. Opening the side walls of greenhouses increased syrphid numbers within it, and this should be considered in pest management regimes.									19	0	0	0	21	1	23			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000253740400014

In the present study we evaluated the effect of temperature on the behavioural plasticity of antlion larvae, the sit-and-wait predators, which are considerably more dependent on local habitat conditions. We provided ethological descriptions of pit construction and feeding behaviour. An increase in temperature led to greater activity and consequently to greater frequency of sand tossing during pit construction. Larvae constructed bigger pits at higher temperatures, but required less time than at lower temperatures, when the resulting pits were the smallest. At low temperature, larvae required more time for feeding, and behaviour followed a core pattern with little variety, in comparison to behaviour at high temperatures. Two behavioural patterns occurred only at the highest temperature: 'relocation' and 'submergence', presumably in response to high temperatures.									7	0	0	0	8	0	8			0005-7959	1568-539X		WOS:000365978700003		
J	Stellwagen, Sarah D.; Opell, Brent D.; Short, Kelly G.								Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				217	9			1563	1569		10.1242/jeb.097816				MAY 2014	2014	Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by Argiope aurantia, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, A. aurantia thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.									25	0	0	0	22	0	25			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000335583500026	24501134

AMERICAN NATURALIST				175	2			269	276		10.1086/649583				FEB 2010	2010	Bergmann's rule ( body size increases with latitude) has long interested biologists; however, its mechanism remains unclear. An overlooked mechanism ( latitudinal variation in plant quality) might help explain Bergmann's rule. We studied three herbivores. In the field, the planthopper Prokelisia and the sea hare Aplysia, but not the long-horned grasshopper Orchelimum, were larger at high latitudes, following Bergmann's rule. In the laboratory, all three species grew larger or faster on high-latitude plants. High-latitude diets increased Prokelisia size and Aplysia growth rates by 8% and 72%, respectively, enough to explain the increase in field body size toward high latitudes. Therefore, latitudinal variation in herbivore body size could be influenced by latitudinal variation in plant quality, which may directly or indirectly also affect body size in detritivores, parasitoids, and predators. Studies of Bergmann's rule should consider the influence of biotic factors on body size in addition to abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation.									41	1	1	0	37	0	41			0003-0147			WOS:000273650200014	20014953

Along temperate Atlantic shorelines, the isopod Idotea balthica from high latitudes are 53% longer on average than isopods from low latitudes. When reared at 6 degrees degrees--24 degrees degrees C, juveniles increased growth and development rates with temperature. Because the increase in growth rate with temperature outstripped increases in development rate, female size at maturity increased with temperature. This thermal sensitivity of growth cannot account for the latitudinal pattern in body size. Within temperature treatments, females from low latitudes reached sexual maturity at younger ages and at a smaller size than did females from higher latitudes. This shift in life-history strategy is predicted by latitudinal declines in predation pressure, which we tested using field-tethering experiments. Overall, isopods at low latitudes had a 44% greater mortality risk from daytime predators relative to isopods at higher latitudes. We conclude that a latitudinal gradient in predation risk, not temperature, is principally responsible for Bergmann''s rule in I. balthica. Increases in body size during future warming of oceans may be constrained by local patterns of predation risk.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000322901300008	23933725

However, the mechanisms that would underlie these predicted responses are not clear. Many studies have focused on proximate mechanisms of physiological processes affecting individual growth. One can also consider ultimate mechanisms involving adaptive explanations by evaluating temperature effects on different vital rates across the life history and using the information in a population dynamical model. Here, we combine long-term data for a top predator in freshwater ecosystems (pike; Esox lucius) with a stochastic integral projection model to analyze concurrent effects of temperature on vital rates, body size, and population dynamics. As predicted, the net effect of warming on population growth rate (fitness) is positive, but the thermal sensitivity of this rate is highly size- and vital rate--dependent. These results are not sensitive to increasing variability in temperature. Somatic growth follows the temperature-size rule, and our results support an adaptive explanation for this response. The stable length structure of the population shifts with warming toward an increased proportion of medium-sized but a reduced proportion of small and large individuals. This study highlights how demographic approaches can help reveal complex underlying mechanisms for population responses to warming.									33	0	0	0	31	0	34			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000330088400009	24464198	
J	Schmitz, Oswald J.; Rosenblatt, Adam E.; Smylie, Meredith								Temperature dependence of predation stress and the nutritional ecology of a generalist herbivore								ECOLOGY				97	11			3119	3130		10.1002/ecy.1524				NOV 2016	2016	Prey at risk of predation may experience stress and respond physiologically by altering their metabolic rates. Theory predicts that such physiological changes should alter prey nutrient demands from N-rich to C-rich macronutrients and shift the balance between maintenance and growth/reproduction. Theory further suggests that for ectotherms, temperature stands to exacerbate this stress. Yet, the interactive effects of predation stress and temperature stress on diet, metabolism, and survival of ectotherms are not well known. This knowledge gap was addressed with a laboratory study in which wild juvenile grasshoppers were collected, assigned to one of three groups, and raised at three different temperatures. All grasshoppers had access to equal quantities of two diets composed of opposite carbohydrate:protein ratios. Half of the individuals in each temperature group were exposed to predation risk cues from spider predators, while the other half were kept in risk free conditions. Grasshoppers consumed more carbohydrates when exposed to predation risk, but consumption favored greater protein intake as temperature increased. Moreover, the difference in carbohydrate intake between risk cue and risk free treatments diminished as temperature increased. Furthermore, variability between individual consumption patterns both within and between treatments decreased markedly as temperature increased, suggesting that higher temperatures promote more consistent individual consumption behaviors. Grasshoppers grew faster and larger as temperature increased, which translated into higher survival rates at higher temperatures. Warmer grasshoppers also did not alter their metabolic rates in response to predation risk cues, in contrast to colder grasshoppers. Digestive efficiency increased with temperature as well -- further indicating that lower temperatures were much more stressful than higher temperatures for grasshoppers. The study shows that physiological responses of ectothermic herbivores to predation stress are highly plastic and temperature dependent, with higher temperatures promoting increased protein intake, growth, development, survival, and digestive efficiency relative to colder temperatures. These findings help to reconcile why dietary responses (proportion of protein vs. carbohydrate intake) to predation stress may vary among different prey taxa studied previously.									30	0	0	0	28	0	30			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000387228200022	27870021

This study documents the nesting and foraging ecology of a large (similar to 13 mm total length) arboreal trap-jaw ant, Odontomachus hastatus (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in a sandy plain forest on Cardoso Island, off the coast of Southeast Brazil. The results showed that O. hastatus nested in root clusters of epiphytic bromeliads, most commonly Vriesea procera (70% of nest plants). Mature O. hastatus colonies include one to several queens and about 500 workers. Foraging by O. hastatus is primarily nocturnal year-round, with increased foraging activity during the wet/warm season. The foragers hunt singly in the trees, preying on a variety of canopy-dwelling arthropods, with flies, moths, ants, and spiders accounting for > 60% of the prey captured. Although predators often have impacts on prey populations, the ecological importance of O. hastatus remains to be studied.									21	0	0	0	19	0	21				1536-2442		WOS:000302754900001	22957686

(Rosaceae). In the shade, leaf damage is extensive in both species, whereas in full light, it is extensive in P. padus, but very low in P. serotina. We determined the influence of Prunus species and light conditions on differences in performance of both sexes of this folivore. In a laboratory experiment in which larvae were fed with leaves of a single species grown under particular light conditions, we measured larval, pupal, and adult mass, efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), duration of development, total food eaten, and relative growth rate. In the field, we observed differences in beetle mass on shrubs of the two species growing under various light conditions. From the field observations, we hypothesised that leaves of the invasive P. serotina are not an equally good food source as leaves of P. padus for G. quinquepunctata, and the preference of these beetles for shaded shrubs is most favourable for their growth and development. Under laboratory conditions, we found that the beetle growth rate was not affected significantly by Prunus species or light conditions, despite the significant effect of light condition on the structure and chemical composition of Prunus seedlings. The lower ECI value for larvae feeding on sunlit leaves was compensated for by their higher level of consumption. In the field, adult insect mass was higher on P. padus than on P. serotina, and higher on sunlit shrubs of both species than on shaded ones. Under natural conditions, the mass of adult insects is probably also affected by other factors, such as predators and competition among folivores.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000354184900004

In Europe, the native pentatomid predator Picromerus bidens (Linnaeus) has been considered a potential alternative to the North American pentatomid Podisus maculiventris (Say) for the control of lepidopteran, coleopteran and hymenopteran defoliator pests. In the current study, prey consumption and developmental duration of the predatory stages of P. bidens and P. maculiventris were investigated at three temperatures (18, 23 and 27 degrees C) in the laboratory using caterpillars of Spodoptera littoralis as prey. Development time from second to fifth instar was longer for P. bidens than for P. maculiventris, taking on average 17-44 and 14-32 days, respectively, at the different temperatures. Total nymphal consumption of fourth instar S. littoralis caterpillars indicated a greater voracity of P. bidens as compared with P. maculiventris at both the low and high temperatures tested (18 and 27 degrees C). At 23 degrees C, however, the predation rate of P. maculiventris nymphs exceeded that of P. bidens nymphs. Effect of temperature on the functional response of P. bidens to densities of fourth instar Spodoptera exigua was assessed on potted green bean plants. Female adults of P. bidens exhibited a type II functional response at 18 and 23 degrees C but a type III response at 27 degrees C. Searching efficiency was not affected by temperature but handling time decreased from 4.2 to 1.4 h as temperature increased from 18 to 23 degrees C. However, the predator spent twice as much time handling prey at 27 degrees C (2.9 h) than at 23 degrees C. This study indicates high predation rates of P. bidens at a wide range of temperatures and suggests that the species may be a valuable asset for the biological control of defoliating caterpillars, provided that obstacles to its mass production can be overcome.									21	1	0	0	24	1	24			0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000241874700005	17092360

Such information would be especially relevant with regard to prey physiology and resulting changes in prey stoichiometry. We investigated in Enallagma cyathigerum damselfly larvae the effects of a 4 degrees C warming (20 degrees C vs. 24 degrees C) and predation risk on growth rate, physiology and body stoichiometry, for the first time including all key mechanisms suggested by the general stress paradigm (GSP) on how stressors shape changes in body stoichiometry. Growth rate and energy storage were higher at 24 degrees C. Based on thermodynamic principles and the growth rate hypothesis, we could demonstrate predictable reductions in body C:P under warming and link these to the increase in P-rich RNA; the associated warming-induced decrease in C:N may be explained by the increased synthesis of N-rich proteins. Yet, under predation risk, growth rate instead decreased with warming and the warming-induced decreases in C:N and C:P disappeared. As predicted by the GSP, larvae increased body C:N and C:P at 24 degrees C under predation risk. Notably, we did not detect the assumed GSP-mechanisms driving these changes: despite an increased metabolic rate there was neither an increase of C-rich biomolecules (instead fat and sugar contents decreased under predation risk), nor a decrease of N-rich proteins. We hypothesize that the higher C:N and N:P under predation risk are caused by a higher investment in morphological defense. This may also explain the stronger predator-induced increase in C:N under warming. The expected higher C:P under predation risk was only present under warming and matched the observed growth reduction and associated reduction in P-rich RNA. Our integrated mechanistic approach unraveled novel pathways of how warming and predation risk shape body stoichiometry. Key findings that (1) warming effects on elemental stoichiometry were predictable and only present in the absence of predation risk and that (2) warming reinforced the predator-induced effects on C:N:P, are pivotal in understanding how nonconsumptive predator effects under global warming will shape prey populations.									24	0	0	0	22	0	24			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000367287900014	26909432

Due to the effects of temperature on both the physiology and the behaviour of such ectotherms, understanding how global warming may influence their ecological impact is a research priority. These species were therefore exposed to three different food types to determine their detritivorous, herbivorous and carnivorous characters, and predation was measured characterizing the Holling's functional response. The effect of increasing water temperatures (15, 20, 25A degrees C) on both the food choice and predatory activities was investigated. Both species showed a significant preference for animal tissues at all temperatures. The total food intake increased with temperature for G. tigrinus but did not change for D. villosus, which may result from specific species differences in metabolic requirements. The consumption of live prey strongly increased with temperature. The main differences were an increased searching efficiency in G. tigrinus and a decreased handling time in D. villosus as temperature increased, which may result from differences in foraging strategies. These results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the predation pressure of both invasive gammarids on prey species.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000385154400004

In the greenhouse crop, male captures and leaf infestation were low in winter and increased steadily in spring up to 797.3 males/trap/week and 6.4 mines/leaf, respectively. Under open-field conditions, males were captured all year round with a peak in early September, concurrently with highest mean daily temperatures. Pest density in potato crops was very low (< 0.3 mines/leaf), as well as on S. nigrum (0.16 mines/leaf). Conversely, high pest infestation was observed in tomato leaves (3.8 mines/leaf) and fruits (27% damaged fruits). Eggs, larvae and adults were detected over two consecutive winters, indicating that T. absoluta can develop continuously over the year under natural conditions. Parasitoids were recorded throughout the survey at low rates (a parts per thousand currency sign16.1%). The most active beneficials were Necremnus tutae and Neochrysocharis formosa in protected and open-field crops, respectively. The tomato leafminer completed 6 generations in the greenhouse tomato crop during the winter-spring growing season, whereas in open-field crops the pest completed two generations on winter potato and 4-5 in spring-summer tomato. The degree-day model based on minimum and maximum temperatures reliably described the population dynamics in the protected crop, and estimated the completion of 7.4 generations per year under open-field Mediterranean conditions.									20	1	0	0	17	0	22			0334-2123	1876-7184		WOS:000365029800015

Selective agents, such as introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits, suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection. These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to selection by temperature.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000466555000008

These cryptic anoles live low on trunks in shaded rain forest and are active throughout the day but appear to spend most of their time in shade. Body temperatures averaged 28.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C, which is 1.3 degrees C higher than substrate temperatures and 1.7 degrees C higher than air temperatures. Females were larger and reach sexual maturity at a larger SVL than males. Females in late dry season often contain two oviductal eggs that differed in shell condition indicating that they were not ovulated simultaneously. Females had evidence of as many as four clutches (two oviductal eggs and two different-sized enlarged vitellogenic follicles) suggesting rapid clutch production. The diet consists of a variety of invertebrates, with grasshoppers, homopterans, insect larvae, and roaches dominating volumetrically. On average, these lizards contained 1.6 +/- 0.1 prey items. Prey size varied with lizard size, but no sexual differences existed. These lizards appear to capture a small number of large prey. Many ecological and life-history traits of A. capito are similar to those of other Anolis lizards suggesting an historical origin.									15	0	1	0	19	5	21			0022-1511			WOS:000228053200004

Using field surveys and cage exclusion techniques, we identified the effect of natural enemies and abiotic factors on the growth of soybean aphid populations in 2004 and 2005. The soybean aphid population was significantly limited by natural enemies in the field. Generalist predators dominated the natural enemy community. One species, Orius insidiosus Say (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) represented 85-90% of predators found. There was a significant negative relationship between aphid population growth and O. insidiosus abundance. For other predators, there were no relationships between abundance and aphid population growth. The spatial distribution of aphids among plants affected the impact of O. insidiosus on aphid population growth. When aphids were distributed in a clumped manner, increases in O. insidiosus numbers resulted in lower aphid growth rates. For randomly distributed aphids, there was no effect of 0. insidiosus abundance on aphid population growth. Finally, we found no relationship between aphid population growth and degree-day accumulations. The potential of O. insidiosus to suppress soybean aphid population growth at low aphid numbers and the importance of the predator to soybean aphid integrated pest management are discussed.									114	3	0	0	114	0	117			0046-225X			WOS:000241170600025

J	MURRAY, AM; GILLER, PS								LIFE-HISTORY AND OVERWINTERING TACTICS OF VELIA-CAPRAI TAM (HEMIPTERA, VELIIDAE) IN SOUTHERN IRELAND								AQUATIC INSECTS				13	4			229	243		10.1080/01650429109361450				1991	1991	Velia caprai Tamanini (Hemiptera: Veliidae) is predominantly a stream dweller, and has been considered univoltine in the British Isles, with adults overwintering in a reproductively immature state. This study reveals a far more complex life-cycle. Dissections of females captured between October 1986 and March 1987 revealed that while 17% of individuals had deposits of adipose tissue and showed no reproductive development (diapause individuals), the majority of females examined (83%) revealed mature ovaries. This presence of a non-diapause overwintering subpopulation of reproductively mature females has not been previously recorded for this species. The absence of adipose tissue in these latter females, plus the presence of obviously full guts in 24% of cases - indicating very recent feeding - supports this non-diapause overwintering. Sampling also revealed that fifth instar larvae overwintered and these comprised 2.3% of all individuals (excluding first instar larvae) captured between November 1986 and March 1987.Three different overwintering tactics were therefore identified with early spring populations therefore consisting of mature egg-bearing females, immature females and some fifth instar larvae. Information from less complete data of spring 1986 confirmed that the variation in the overwintering status of females in 1987 was not a once-off response to unusual climatic conditions. This distinct within-population temporal variability in the attainment of reproductive maturity by the females of Velia caprai extended the reproductive season of the species, and may help buffer populations from being overly affected by adverse weather conditions during the late autumn and early spring months.First instar larvae were encountered in the field by mid-March - two months earlier than previous records. New-generation adults were subsequently captured in mid-June, and there is indirect evidence to suggest a partial second generation may sometimes occur under suitable circumstances. Growth experiments over a range of temperatures indicated faster development at the higher temperatures, although a reduced survival rate at temperatures above 20-degrees-C was noted.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0165-0424			WOS:A1991HD28900006		
P	JONES T								Sustainable aquaponics system for farming e.g. game fish, has insulated and heated winter quarters that are provided for fish in colder temperatures, and plant growing areas that produce vegetables or fruits for domestic consumption					US2013098303-A1	JONES T																			NOVELTY - The system has a pond (2) that is connected by a pump (3) to raceways. Each raceway contains plant species that remove waste materials from raceway water and provide food for fish. Water from natural ecosystem is fed into the pond. The insulated and heated winter quarters are provided for fish in colder temperatures. The lower members in the food chain are spawned faster than lower members consumed by predator fish. The plant growing areas are provided adjacent to the raceways. The plant growing areas are enabled to produce vegetables or fruits for domestic consumption. USE - Sustainable aquaponics system for farming fish such as game fish such as grass carp, threadfin shad, bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass and hybrid striped bass. ADVANTAGE - Since the insulated and heated winter quarters are provided for fish in colder temperatures, the fishes are comfortable and enabled to grow and spawn throughout winter months. The fishes and plants are grew faster, stronger and more resistant to disease when exposed to naturally balance ecosystem found in the pond water or lake water than artificially cleaned water found in the overwhelming majority of aquaculture recirculation systems. The genetics of the fish, insects, worms and plants grown within the system is improved with disease resistance, high reproduction rate, high growth rate and high yield. The cost of installing the sustainable aquaponic system is reduced. The system derives water from open, natural, established pond and lake ecosystem so as to ensure that the raceways are adequately seeded with all of nature's good and bad bacteria, algae, parasites and other life.The recirculation system, cage aquaculture and pond aquaculture are bonded in order to reduce system build out cost, daily operational cost, while improving overall efficiency, increasing sustainability and net profitability.

Captures were performed with CDC light traps in 7 districts, 5 days per month, during 2 consecutive years (January 2000 to December 2001). A total of 3240 sand flies were captured and identified Sixteen species were found, among which 15 belonged to the genus Lutzomyia and one to the genus Brumptomyia. Lutzomyia longipalpis, a proven vector of AVL, was the predominant species (71.85%) throughout the time period The interference of climatic factors (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) over the populational dynamics of the sand flies was determined. Statistical analysis of the data showed a significant correlation among the number of phlebotomine sand flies collected, rainfall, and humidity, whereas the effect of temperature was negligible, in that particular region. The amount of collected phlebotomine, the number of human cases, and the prevalence of canine AVL in the districts of Porteirinha are discussed									57	0	0	0	43	31	64			0074-0276	1678-8060		WOS:000223816700004	15543410

Phenological mismatch in Arctic-breeding shorebirds: Impact of snowmelt and unpredictable weather conditions on food availability and chick growth								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				9	11			6693	6707		10.1002/ece3.5248				JUN 2019	2019	The ecological consequences of climate change have been recognized in numerous species, with perhaps phenology being the most well-documented change. Phenological changes may have negative consequences when organisms within different trophic levels respond to environmental changes at different rates, potentially leading to phenological mismatches between predators and their prey. This may be especially apparent in the Arctic, which has been affected more by climate change than other regions, resulting in earlier, warmer, and longer summers. During a 7-year study near Utqiavik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, we estimated phenological mismatch in relation to food availability and chick growth in a community of Arctic-breeding shorebirds experiencing advancement of environmental conditions (i.e., snowmelt). Our results indicate that Arctic-breeding shorebirds have experienced increased phenological mismatch with earlier snowmelt conditions. However, the degree of phenological mismatch was not a good predictor of food availability, as weather conditions after snowmelt made invertebrate availability highly unpredictable. As a result, the food available to shorebird chicks that were 2-10 days old was highly variable among years (ranging from 6.2 to 28.8 mg trap(-1) day(-1) among years in eight species), and was often inadequate for average growth (only 20%-54% of Dunlin and Pectoral Sandpiper broods on average had adequate food across a 4-year period). Although weather conditions vary among years, shorebirds that nested earlier in relation to snowmelt generally had more food available during brood rearing, and thus, greater chick growth rates. Despite the strong selective pressure to nest early, advancement of nesting is likely limited by the amount of plasticity in the start and progression of migration. Therefore, long-term climatic changes resulting in earlier snowmelt have the potential to greatly affect shorebird populations, especially if shorebirds are unable to advance nest initiation sufficiently to keep pace with seasonal advancement of their invertebrate prey.									6	0	0	0	5	0	7			2045-7758			WOS:000472622400045	31236253

Because of its apparent adaptation to these different climates, it is being considered as a potential biological control agent of the pest Thrips tabaci Lind. in various crops in Iran. We measured the basic life-history parameters of O. niger on a diet of corn pollen and eggs of the moth Ephestia kitehniella Zeller at 3 constant temperatures (26, 29 and 32 degrees C under 16L-8D) to assess the possibility of culturing this predator for mass releases. Bean pods were supplied as oviposition sites. The intrinsic rate of increase was 0.113, 0.127 and 0.157 daughters/female/day at 26, 29, and 32 degrees C respectively, Analysis of the mortality of eggs, juveniles and adults suggests that the population growth rate is restricted most by juvenile mortality. This mortality is probably caused by cannibalism, the occurrence of which should therefore be minimized in mass cultures.									17	1	0	0	22	0	22			0003-6862	1347-605X		WOS:000234584400001

The long-term viability of metapopulations is dependent on independent dynamics of local populations, because it mitigates fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole. Metapopulation viability will be compromised if climate change increases spatial synchrony in weather conditions associated with population growth rates. We studied a recently reported increase in metapopulation synchrony of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the Finnish archipelago, to see if it could be explained by an increase in synchrony of weather conditions. For this, we used 23years of butterfly survey data together with monthly weather records for the same period. We first examined the associations between population growth rates within different regions of the metapopulation and weather conditions during different life-history stages of the butterfly. We then examined the association between the trends in the synchrony of the weather conditions and the synchrony of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics. We found that precipitation from spring to late summer are associated with the M. cinxia per capita growth rate, with early summer conditions being most important. We further found that the increase in metapopulation synchrony is paralleled by an increase in the synchrony of weather conditions. Alternative explanations for spatial synchrony, such as increased dispersal or trophic interactions with a specialist parasitoid, did not show paralleled trends and are not supported. The climate driven increase in M. cinxia metapopulation synchrony suggests that climate change can increase extinction risk of spatially structured populations living in fragmented landscapes by altering their dynamics.									21	0	0	0	17	0	21			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000441746900035	29682866

Identified prey came from six insect orders: Coleoptera (4.0%), Diptera (33.0%), Hemiptera (17.0%), Hymenoptera (20.0%), Psocoptera (23.0%), and Thysanoptera (3.0%). Mating was preceded by male courtship and was in the tail-to-tail position. Eggs were laid in the soil, in the shade of overhanging vegetation and fallen dried oak leaves. There was a distinct daily rhythm of activity for feeding, mating, and oviposition. Grooming behavior was not common but when it did occur, resembled that described for other species of Asilidae. Information is also provided on habitat, resting behavior, and predators.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1302-0250			WOS:000341280700015

Behavioural, morphological and coloration plasticity are common responses of prey to predation risk. Theory predicts that prey should respond to the relative magnitude of risk, rather than a single level of response to any risk level. In addition to conspecific and predator densities, prey growth and differentiation rates affect the duration of vulnerability to size- and stage-limited predators and therefore the relative value of defences.2. We reared tadpoles of the Neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus with or without cues from a predator (Belostoma sp.) in ecologically relevant warm or cool temperatures. To track phenotypic changes, we measured morphology, tail coloration and developmental stage at three points during the larval period.3. Cues from predators interacted with growth conditions causing tadpoles to alter their phenotype, changing only tail colour in response to predators in warm water, but both morphology and colour in cool growth conditions. Tadpoles with predators in warm water altered coloration early but converged on the morphology of predator-free controls. Water temperature alone had no effect on tadpole phenotype.4. We demonstrate that seemingly small variation in abiotic environmental conditions can alter the expression of phenotypic plasticity, consistent with predictions about how growth rate affects risk. Predator-induced tadpole phenotypes depended on temperature, with strong expression only in temperatures that slow development. Thermal modulation of plastic responses to predators may be broadly relevant to poikilotherm development. It is important to include a range of realistic growth conditions in experiments to more fully understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of plasticity.									22	1	0	0	20	1	23			0021-8790			WOS:000285110600008	20964684

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				102	5			759	770		10.1007/s10641-019-00869-4				MAY 2019	2019	In this study, the growth rate, gut fullness, diet composition and spatial distribution of brown trout was compared between artificial channels with and without fine wood (FW). Access to FW resulted in significantly lower brown trout growth rates over the study period from late summer to early winter as water temperatures declined from 17 degrees C to 1 degrees C. Access to FW resulted in minor differences in occurrence of the most common taxa found in brown trout diets, except for chironomid larvae which were found in c. 60% of the brown trout guts from control treatments but in only 30% of the guts from FW treatments in early winter. Diet consisted primarily of case-bearing and free-living Trichoptera larvae, Asellus, chironomid and Ephemeroptera larvae. Brown trout gut fullness was not significantly affected by access to FW bundles. Brown trout aggregated among FW but were more evenly distributed in channels lacking it. Our results suggest that juvenile brown trout use FW as a shelter at a wide range of water temperatures, and that this behaviour may result in reduced growth rates during their first fall and the onset of their first winter. We also show that prey availability and the composition of brown trout diet changes from late summer to early winter and that FW has a small but significant effect on brown trout diet composition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000468519700008

(Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), can be detected by relative sampling techniques as early as the second week of May. The perceived seasonal pattern of L. campestris varied with trapping method. Of the three relative sampling methods used, probe traps consistently captured more bugs of both sexes than cardboard traps in the grain and sticky flight traps. Probe traps showed a third degree polynomial trend through the season. On the other hand, flight traps were effective for monitoring L. campestris population during early and mid-summer when temperatures were high, but the effectiveness declined during late summer and early fall. Cardboard traps showed the opposite trend to those of flight traps, with increasing L. campestris abundance during the fall when bugs sought refuge as temperature decreased. Sampling date and environmental factors, including grain moisture content, air and grain temperatures were correlated with trap capture. Earlier work reported that L. campestris showed a highly female biased sex ratio in the field as opposed to a 1:1 sex ratio in laboratory colonies. The present study found that the estimate of sex ratios in the field can differ with trapping methods. Of the three relative sampling methods used, flight and cardboard traps, in most cases, showed no deviation from a 1:1 sex ratio. Probe traps, however, indicated a highly female biased sex ratio in field populations. Absolute sampling using a 1140 mi cup sampler also showed no deviation from a 1:1 sex ratio in the field population. The data suggested that relative sampling methods may be inappropriate for sex ratio estimation in the field. Thus, an absolute sampling method is required for determination of the true field sex ratio of L. campestris. Analyses of dispersion patterns showed that both males and females of L. campestris exhibit an aggregated spatial distribution in the grain.									8	0	0	0	8	0	9			0013-8703			WOS:A1995QY17600005

No other bat species was observed at 65-degrees-N. In one maternity colony, Young northern bats were born in July and were flying by early August. The diet consisted mainly of small insects, predominantly dipterans, which were captured and eaten in the air. The bats maintained a nocturnal (22:00-02:30 h) foraging schedule in summer, partly reflecting the activity of insects, and spent about three hours away from the day roost each night. Owing to the short periods of darkness, the foraging flights usually started and ended in daylight.

J	Stapp, P								Microhabitat use and community structure of darkling beetles (Coleoptera:Tenebrionidae) in shortgrass prairie: Effects of season, shrub cover and soil type								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				137	2			298	311		10.2307/2426849				APR 1997	1997	I conducted pitfall-trapping studies from 1992 through 1995 to evaluate the effects of vegetation structure and soil texture on seasonal variation in the distribution, relative abundance and species composition of darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) in shrub-dominated areas of shortgrass prairie in N-central Colorado. Numbers of beetles captured in traps placed in shrub, cactus, grass and bare-ground microhabitats were used to assess microhabitat use and diel timing of activity, differences in the relative abundance of beetles between spring and summer and to compare beetle communities on sites with different shrub vegetation and soil types. Beetles were most numerous in summer on all sites, although some species showed peaks of activity in spring. All but two species (Eleodes extricata, E. hispilabris) were captured significantly more often in traps beneath shrubs, underscoring the importance of this microhabitat for thermal cover, food or protection from predators. Further, in shrub-dominated areas, beetles were more nocturnal than had been reported previously for adjacent grasslands, suggesting that shrubs kept temperatures on low-lying areas warmer at night than on open prairie. Fourteen tenebrionid species were captured, and on average, significantly more species were captured beneath shrubs than in other microhabitats. Each site had a suite of five resident species, of which only Eleodes obscura and Embaphion contusum were captured on all sites during all trapping periods. Species richness and beetle abundance, especially of the most common species (Eleodes obscura), were inversely related to shrub cover but were greater ill areas with coarsely textured soils. Overall, tenebrionid communities in shrub-dominated areas were similar to those reported for open prairie, but small species tend to predominate in grasslands, perhaps because most refuges are relatively small. The prevalence of larger beetles in areas with sandy soils and large shrubs may be related to the number of suitable refuges, both belowground and in vegetation, as well as the availability of preferred feeding and oviposition sites.									48	16	0	0	49	1	64			0003-0031			WOS:A1997WZ28900011

The most interesting function, however, is the use of adhesive threads to capture prey, as the bonding must be performed within milliseconds and under unsuitable conditions (movement of prey, variable environmental conditions, unfavourable attack angle, etc.) to be nonetheless successful. In the following study a detailed characterization of the prey capture system of the world-renowned glowworm group Arachnocampa from the macroscopic to the ultrastructural level is performed. The data reveal that the adhesive droplets consist mostly of water and display hygroscopic properties at varying humidity levels. The droplet core of Arachnocampa luminosa includes a certain amount of the elements sodium, sulphur and potassium (beside carbon, oxygen and nitrogen), while a different element composition is found in the two related species A. richardsae and A. tasmaniensis. Evidence for lipids, carbohydrates and proteins was negative on the histochemical level, however X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the presence of peptides within the droplet content. Different to earlier assumptions, the present study indicates that rather than oxalic acid, urea or uric acid are present in the adhesive droplets, presumably originating from the gut. Comparing the capture system in Arachnocampa with those of orb-spiders, large differences appear not only regarding the silky threads, but also, in the composition, hygroscopic properties and size of the mucous droplets.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000392754300002	27973586

Their life-history strategies were greatly influenced by the characteristics of their environment, i.e., a summer dry period with relatively warm temperatures, but strategies differed among species. Guadalgenus franzi was semivoltine and probably underwent nymphal quiescence when the stream was dry. Hemimelaena flaviventris and I. curtata had relatively short univoltine life cycles that overlapped, but I. curtata was slightly ahead of H. flaviventris. Both species passed the dry period in the egg stage, probably with a diapause phase. Growth rates of H. flaviventris and I. curtata peaked before emergence, whereas growth rate of G. franzi peaked immediately before and after the dry period. The 3 species had relatively short flight periods compared with other species from seasonal streams. Guadalgenus franzi and I. curtata were mainly scrapers that fed on diatoms, whereas H. flaviventris was mainly predatory. Diet changed somewhat in relation to size, and prey electivity patterns differed among species. All 3 species preferred Chironomidae, but G.franzi preferred Chironomidae principally when smaller. All 3 species had high secondary production relative to other stonefly species from both temporary and permanent waters.									43	0	0	0	42	0	46			0887-3593			WOS:000273885900008

Pitfall traps set for 24 h month-1 captured 1567 dung beetles of 21 species. The species Canthidium martinezi, Deltochilum pseudoparile and Canthon femoralis accounted for 62% of all individuals captured. While species overlap was high (> 80%) between diurnal and nocturnal samples and between howler monkey and coati dung baits, coati dung attracted species such as C. martinezi, D. pseudoparile and Onthophagus rhinolophus while species such as C. femoralis and Copris laeviceps were numerically dominant at howler monkey dung. Thirteen non-ball rolling dung beetle species and eight ball-rolling species accounted for 43% and for 57% of all beetles captured respectively. Dung beetles were present and active in all months of the year, but occurred in higher numbers between the months of March and October, when temperatures were higher. Relative abundance of howler monkey and coati dung in the rain forest of Los Tuxtlas was estimated at 11.2g (fresh weight) ha-1 day-1 and at 13.0 g ha-1 day-1 respectively, a seemingly low amount for the large number of scarabs attracted to the dung.									79	1	0	0	84	11	90			0266-4674			WOS:A1993KW99500004

Disturbance treatments were (1) burning at high-intensity and salvage-logging; (2) clearcutting, roller-chopping and broadcast seeding, and; (3) clearcutting and bracke-seeding. Community similarity of coleopterans was high. No differences in species richness, diversity, density, or evenness were detected. Of 40 species captured, only seven were common (n > 50). Predaceous beetles were numerically dominant followed by scavengers. Few xylophagous or herbivorous coleopterans were captured, probably due to trap bias. Peaks of annual above-ground terrestrial activity varied among species. An absence of differences among treatments may reflect similar plant communities or structural habitat features. Additionally, a dearth of mature forest specialists might be predicted in systems where mature forest was historically rare due to large-scale, high-intensity, and low-frequency wildfire.									20	0	0	0	20	0	20			0015-4040			WOS:A1995RF56400007

The relationship between the body size of both sexes was allometric with female-biased sexual size dimorphism. Body size of males did not change with latitude or temperature, while that of females changed significantly with temperature. Larger females were found in regions with higher temperature which is presumably a result of an optimal climate: higher temperature and longer season provide higher prey availability which accelerates the growth rate of females, leading to a larger body size. As female size varied more than male size, a sexual size dimorphism cline was observed in Z. rubidum. Larger sexual size dimorphism was found in warmer regions. These results thus suggest that environmental conditions (temperature) influence intraspecific variation in sexual size dimorphism in Z. rubidum.									5	0	0	0	6	1	6			0022-2933			WOS:000241266500005

Comparison of Searching Behaviour of Two Aphelinid Parasitoids of the Greenhouse Whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum under Summer vs. Winter Conditions in a Temperate Climate								JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR				22	2			134	147		10.1007/s10905-008-9160-1				MAR 2009	2009	Searching behaviour of two aphelinid parasitoids, Encarsia formosa Gahan and Eretmocerus eremicus Rose and Zolnerowich, was compared in a controlled environment under simulated summer [high light intensity (83 +/- 1 W/m(2)), and 24 +/- 1A degrees C] and winter [low light intensity (11 A +/- 0.5 W/m(2)), and 20 A +/- 1A degrees C] greenhouse conditions on tomato leaflets, with and without a single 3rd instar whitefly host, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), within a 4-cm tomato leaflet arena. Residence time of both parasitoid species was longer on infested leaflets vs. clean leaflets, and longer under winter than summer conditions. When parasitoids encountered a host on infested leaflets, residence time increased. In all cases, residence time of E. formosa was longer that of E. eremicus. Proportion of time spent searching (i.e. antennating leaf surface while walking or standing still) was longer on clean vs. infested leaflets for both E. formosa and E. eremicus. Walking speed by E. eremicus on clean leaflets was faster than E. formosa under both summer and winter conditions. Host handling time and proportion of host acceptance did not vary among parasitoids. These findings suggest that E. eremicus could be more efficient in host finding on tomato leaflets than E. formosa over all seasons, especially in the winter when natural light is limiting and where daylight temperatures are a parts per thousand yen20A degrees C.									8	1	0	0	5	0	10			0892-7553	1572-8889		WOS:000262698700005

The behavioral repertoire of foraging strategies depends on biotic factors, such as prey type, competition and natural enemies, and abiotic factors, such as temperature and humidity. The foraging activity and predation behavior of Ectatomma brunneum (Formicidae: Ectatomminae) on flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae and Muscidae) in field conditions were observed during 2006-2007. The foraging strategy was exclusively individual and the pattern of predation behavior involved detection/localization, approaching and attacking acts. The majority of attacks were directed to the median part of the body (thorax) of the prey. The adults and larvae of Chrysomya albiceps were the most captured fly species. However, due to a complex interaction between biotic and abiotic factors and high behavioral flexibility more studies are needed to define patterns of foraging strategies for E. brunneum.									4	0	0	0	4	1	5			0361-6525			WOS:000270860800023

Wasp hawking induces endothermic heat production in guard bees								JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE				10						142					SEP 9 2010	2010	When vespine wasps, Vespa velutina Lepeletier (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), hawk (capture) bees at their nest entrances alerted and poised guards of Apis cerana cerana F. and Apis mellifera ligustica Spinola (Hymenoptera: Apidae) have average thoracic temperatures slightly above 24 degrees C. Many additional worker bees of A. cerana, but not A. mellifera, are recruited to augment the guard bee cohort and begin wing-shimmering and body-rocking, and the average thoracic temperature rises to 29.8 +/- 1.6 degrees C. If the wasps persist hawking, about 30 guard bees of A. cerana that have raised their thoracic temperatures to 31.4 +/- 0.9 degrees C strike out at a wasp and form a ball around it. Within about three minutes the core temperature of the heat-balling A. cerana guard bees reaches about 46 degrees C, which is above the lethal limit of the wasps, which are therefore killed. Although guard bees of A. mellifera do not exhibit the serial behavioural and physiological changes of A. cerana, they may also heat-ball hawking wasps. Here, the differences in the sequence of changes in the behaviour and temperature during "resting" and "heat-balling" by A. cerana and A. mellifera are reported.									19	3	0	0	17	2	20				1536-2442		WOS:000281671700001	21073346

Here we show that hornets is initiated by secretion of a foraging-site marking pheromone from the van der Vecht glands (metasomal sternum VI glands) by a single foraging hornet. The lone hornet rubs the basal tuft of the terminal gastral sternite around a prey food resource, such as a honeybee colony, and the hornet nestmates then congregate and attack the marked site ea masse. The sympatric Japanese honeybee Apis cerana japonica (Hymenoptera: Apidae) can detect the hornet marking pheronome, and responds by increasing number of defenders at the nest entrance. When an invading hornet is captured by a defending bee, more than 500 other bees quickly engulf the hornet in a ball which contains isoamyl acetate. Thermography showed that the ball temperature is very high (similar to 47 degrees C), which proves lethal to the hornet but not to the bees. Defenders patrolling the nest entrance also generate high temperatures. These findings suggest that aspects of the interaction between V. mandarinia japonica and A. cerana japonica are specifically coevolved.									138	2	0	0	113	0	145			0028-0836			WOS:A1995RX11100054

Effects of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on development of immatures, reproduction, and prey capture were determined in order to confirm the suitability of F. acarisuga for use in greenhouses. Developmental time ranged from 10 days at 27 degrees C to 34 days at 15 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, developmental time was significantly shorter at 96% RH than at 84% RH. There was very poor survival of immatures at 64% RH and none at 36%. Lifespan of adult females decreased with increasing temperature, but temperature had no significant effect on number of eggs laid. At 20 degrees C, lifespan was longer at 84 and 96% RH than at 64 or 36% RH. The number of spider mites attacked by 3-day-old larvae over 8 h increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 27 degrees C. The number of mites attacked also increased with increasing RR at 27 degrees C. We conclude that F. acarisuga will complete its life cycle and reproduce under conditions typically found in vegetable greenhouses in northern temperate climates. However, extended periods of low RH (<60% RH) could reduce reproduction and survivorship sufficiently to impair the predator's action against spider mite populations.

However, phlebotomine sandflies have been captured in small numbers on the Canary Islands, particularly on the island of Lanzarote, where only one limited survey was carried out almost thirty years ago. The proximity of this island to Morocco, in addition to the high number of tourists, sometimes accompanied by their dogs, from leishmaniasis endemic regions, highlights the importance of studying the sandfly fauna on this island in order to determine the transmission risk of leishmaniasisThirty-eight sampling sites spread across the island were studied, and ecological features were gathered to identify the ecological traits associated to the presence of sandflies. Only 85 sandfly specimens were captured (1.18/m(2)) with the following species distribution: Sergentomyia minuta (0.15 specimens/m(2)), which was reported for the first time on this island, and S. fallax (1.03/m(2)). Sandfly captured were achieved in only 7 out of 38 stations. No specimen of the Phlebotomus genus was captured and given that none of the species captured has been demonstrated vectors of human pathogenic Leishmania and considering that they were captured in low frequency and density, it can be concluded that the current leishmaniasis transmission risk is null.

Nutritional quality or availability of food, however, may vary over latitudinal gradients, resulting in ambiguous effects on body size and maturation rate. The Temperature-Constraint Hypothesis (TCH) predicts that marine herbivorous ectotherms are nutritionally compromised at latitudes exceeding 30 degrees. This provides an opportunity to resolve the contrasting demographic responses of ectotherms to variation in temperature and nutritional status over latitudinal gradients. This study uses analysis of demographic rates to evaluate the predictions of the TSR in a marine herbivorous ectotherm sampled over a significant latitudinal gradient. The direction and magnitude of demographic variation was established in the marine herbivorous fish, Odax pullus (the butterfish), and compared with that of a phylogenetically related but trophically distinct species, the carnivorous Notolabrus fucicola (the banded wrasse). Both species were sampled at three locations across the length of New Zealand covering latitudes between 35 degrees S and 49 degrees S. Growth rate, mean size-at-age, age- and size-at-maturity, life span and abundance were estimated for each species at each location. Demographic traits of both taxa varied with latitude. Both species showed slower initial growth rates, and matured later at a larger body size at higher latitudes than populations sampled at lower latitudes. In addition, abundances increased significantly at higher latitudes in both species. These results were consistent with the TSR but not with the TCH, confirming that nutritional ecology (herbivore vs. carnivory) did not determine demographic patterns over a biologically significant latitudinal gradient. Results from this study suggest that the absence of herbivorous reef fishes from the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere may not reflect a general physiological mechanism as suggested by the TCH and highlights the need to clarify the evolutionary histories of the marine biota of each hemisphere.									32	0	0	0	29	0	32			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000337618100013	24252150

A growing number of studies have documented rapid evolutionary responses to warming, suggesting that populations may be able to persist despite temperature increases. The challenge now is to better understand how species interactions, which are ubiquitous in nature, mediate these population responses to warming. Here, we use laboratory natural selection experiments in a freshwater community to test hypotheses related to how thermal evolution of Daphnia pulex to two selection temperatures (12 and 18 degrees C) is mediated by rapid thermal evolution of its algal resource (Scenedesmus obliquus) or by the presence of the zooplankton predator Chaoborus americanus. We found that cold-evolved algae (a high-quality resource) facilitated the evolution of increased thermal plasticity in Daphnia populations selected at 12 degrees C, for both body size and per capita growth rates (r). Conversely, warm-evolved algae facilitated the evolution of increased r thermal plasticity for Daphnia selected at 18 degrees C. Lastly, we found that the effect of selection temperature on evolved Daphnia body size was more pronounced when Daphnia were also reared with predators. These data demonstrate that trait evolution of a focal population to the thermal environment can be affected by both bottom-up and top-down species interactions and that rapid temperature evolution of a resource can have cascading effects on consumer thermal evolution. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating species interactions when estimating ecological and evolutionary responses of populations and communities to ongoing temperature warming.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1752-4571			WOS:000480580300017	31417627

The primary hosts are lodgepole and ponderosa pines. Recent rising temperatures, however, have allowed these beetles to survive at higher elevations more commonly than in the past, thus threatening whitebark pine, a keystone species of high elevation ecosystems and a highly susceptible host. 2 The extent to which risk in whitebark pine stands may be mitigated by predators or competitors is unknown. We compared the communities of coleopteran predators and competitors of D. ponderosae in sites of varying elevation and species composition in Montana and Wyoming, U. S. A. Sites were selected for low to moderate levels of tree mortality, where the potential of natural enemies to prevent D. ponderosae from transitioning into outbreaks would bemost relevant. Insect populations were evaluated using unbaited flight- intercept panel traps and pheromone- baitedmultiple funnel traps. 3 Only the predatory beetle species Thanasimus undatulus ( Coleoptera: Cleridae) was captured in these non- outbreak stands. Based on the pheromone- baited traps, predator load was higher at low- elevation stands dominated by lodgepole pine than high- elevation stands dominated by whitebark pine. 4 Phloeophagous insects were more prevalent in the mid- and higher- elevation sites, although most of the species captured would not likely compete substantially for resources with D. ponderosae. We also observed differences in species assemblages between the Montana and Wyoming sites, as well as differing utilities of baited and unbaited traps at low versus moderate tree mortality levels.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000437101800009

The ratio of slow and fast developers within an egg batch differed with thermal extremes irrespective of Fl and F15 generations. Adult body mass got depressed after selection for control slow developers at 15 degrees C while it got enhanced for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C. More selected slow developers were found at low temperature and more selected fast developers at high temperature. Selection probably favours the enhancement of immature survival and emergence ratio which was found to be highest for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C and selected slow developers at 15 degrees C. Population level disparity on thermal confliction was observed in ladybird post selection over several generations. Therefore, we put forward that exposure thermal extremes over a long duration, causes an adaptive differentiation in thermal responses of slow and fast developers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000413799200037	29037394

Organisms regularly interact with other species, yet whether climate-mediated evolution can occur in the context of species interactions is not well understood. We tested whether a species interaction could modify evolutionary responses to temperature. We demonstrate that predation pressure by Dipteran larvae (Chaoborus americanus) modified the evolutionary response of a freshwater crustacean (Daphnia pulex) to its thermal environment over approximately seven generations in laboratory conditions. Daphnia kept at 21 degrees C evolved higher population growth rates than those kept at 18 degrees C, but only in those populations that were also reared with predators. Furthermore, predator-mediated selection resulted in the evolution of elevated Daphnia thermal plasticity. This laboratory natural selection experiment demonstrates that biotic interactions can modify evolutionary adaptation to temperature. Understanding the interplay between multiple selective forces can improve predictions of ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to rapid environmental change.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000367482000009	26673935

J	Potter, Kristen A.; Bronstein, Judith; Davidowitz, Goggy								Choice of oviposition sites by Manduca sexta and its consequences for egg and larval performance								ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA				144	3			286	293		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2012.01289.x				SEP 2012	2012	The preference-performance hypothesis predicts that female insects should prefer to lay eggs in locations that enhance offspring performance. This study examines the choices of females regarding where to oviposit within plants, focusing on the hawkmoth Manduca sexta L. (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) and its host Datura wrightii Regel (Solanaceae) in the southwestern USA. Smaller Datura leaves provide cooler microclimates for eggs (which may lead to faster embryonic development, shortening their exposure to egg predators) and more nitrogen for larvae. In contrast, large leaves reach temperatures that are stressfully high (which slows embryonic development) and provide less nitrogen for larvae. Thus, we would expect females to oviposit on small leaves. To examine whether leaf size influences female preference and offspring performance, we used laboratory and field studies to address the following questions. (1) On what size leaves do females typically oviposit? (2) Does the distribution of eggs in nature differ from that expected by chance? And (3) how does leaf size affect survival or growth of eggs and larvae? We find that oviposition choices of females do not lead to the highest probability of offspring survival. Females lay eggs on larger leaves, likely due to the greater accessibility of those leaves; however, eggs are more likely to hatch on small leaves. Larvae grow faster on large leaves, but larvae are also surprisingly mobile, suggesting that the consequences of oviposition site are minor once eggs have hatched. Larval mobility was seen only in the field, not in the laboratory, emphasizing the importance of field studies for predicting real-world performance. Although females' leaf choices are potentially risky for eggs, the threats of high temperature and predation may vary sufficiently in space and time that there is no consistent selection for strong preferences. Furthermore, the fitness consequences for eggs and larvae largely offset each other and offspring are sufficiently mobile to cope with the conditions where they are laid.									17	1	0	0	14	0	17			0013-8703			WOS:000306908300005

The lower developmental thresholds for total development (egg to adult) of the predators ranged from 10.9 (O. c. contaminata) to 14 degrees C (C. u. aegyptica). The lowest and highest degree-day (DD) requirement values for total development of the studied cocinellids were estimated for C. u. aegyptica (166.67 DD) and E. nigripennis (344.83 DD), respectively. The optimum temperature for development of the studied ladybirds, calculated using thirdorder polynomial and Lactin models, was in the range of 27.5-30 degrees C. This study showed that all the five psyllophagous ladybirds successfully complete their development in a wide range of temperatures from 17.5 to 30 degrees C, indicating their high potential for use in biological control programs against A. pistaciae.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000332529600014

Both species are carnivorous and flightless, One of the species, Trechisibus antarcticus, is locally very abundant and in the process of invading the coastal lowland area, where the endemic herbivorous beetle Hydromedion sparsutum (Perimylopidae) is common. Field samples showed the abundance of the endemic species to be much lower, and its adult body size to be larger, in carabid-infested locations than in carabid-free locations. The sample data allowed us to estimate the growth rate of the H. sparsutum larvae and to reconstruct the most likely life-cycle of both species. A laboratory experiment showed a high mortality for the first three (out of six) larval instars of H. sparsutum in groups which had been subjected to predation by T. antarcticus. The duration of the period during which the larvae are vulnerable to predation was shown in a growth experiment to depend on food type. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the interaction between the introduced predator and the endemic prey, and conditions which allowed the former to invade are discussed.									43	0	0	0	41	1	48			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:A1995RJ29400005	28306942

Insect dispersal is generally investigated using mark-release-recapture techniques, whereby marked individuals are released at a known location and then captured at a measured distance. Ectoparasite dispersal has historically been challenging to study, in part because of the ethical concerns associated with releasing marked individuals. Here, we introduce the protein self-marking technique, whereby ectoparasites mark themselves in the field by feeding on the blood of an introduced host. We demonstrate the potential of this technique using laboratory-reared bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L.) that marked themselves by feeding on either rabbit or chicken blood. We then used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect host-specific blood serum proteins in bed bugs. We assessed these protein markers' ability to 1) distinctively identify marked individuals, 2) persist following multiple feedings on an alternate diet, 3) persist over time across a range of temperatures, and 4) transfer from marked to unmarked individuals. Protein markers were detectable in bed bugs before and after molting, remained detectible after multiple feedings on an alternate diet, persisted regardless of whether an individual was starved or fed on an alternate diet following original mark acquisition, and did not transfer between individuals. The duration of detectability depended on temperature. Our results suggest that protein self-marking is an effective technique for marking bed bugs and holds promise for use in dispersal studies of ectoparasitic insects.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-2585	1938-2928		WOS:000390217500014	27493250

In this study, we used comparative functional responses (FRs) to compare resource utilisation (i.e. per capita effects) between young-of-year Largemouth Bass and Florida Bass across different temperatures treatments (18, 24 and 30 degrees C). Culex mosquito larvae were used as prey during the experiments. Across all temperature treatments, Type II FRs were observed, which could cause population-destabilising pressures towards native prey communities due to high predation rates at low prey densities. Attack rates did not differ significantly between the fish species at either temperature. Handling times of Largemouth Bass increased significantly with temperature, whilst the converse was true for Florida Bass. Largemouth Bass were found to have higher maximum feeding rates at the low temperature (18 degrees C), driven by significantly shorter handling times compared to Florida Bass. At the intermediate temperature (24 degrees C), handling times and thus maximum feeding rates did not differ significantly between the two species. At high temperature (30 degrees C) Florida Bass exhibited a significantly higher maximum feeding rate and shorter handling time than Largemouth Bass. These results suggest that temperature drives differential ecological impacts, with Florida Bass exerting higher impact than Largemouth Bass on prey at high temperatures and Largemouth Bass having higher impacts than Florida Bass at lower temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000511976500005

In this study, we sampled the pine engraver Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and its predominant predators Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Paykull) (Coleoptera: Histeridae) in red pine plantations in Wisconsin, USA, over 2 years. We sampled both the prey and predators using flight traps baited with the synthetic aggregation pheromone of I. pini. Flight models were constructed using weather variables (temperature and precipitation), counts of bark beetles and their predators, and temporal variables to incorporate possible effects of seasonality. The number of I. pini per weekly collection period was temperature dependent and decreased with the number of predators, specifically T. dubius in 2001 and P. cylindrica in 2002. The number of predators captured each week was also weather dependent. The predators had similar seasonal phenologies, and the number of each predator species was positively correlated with the other. Including a term for the number of prey did not improve the model fits for either predator for either year. Our results suggest that exogenous weather factors strongly affect the flight activity of I. pini, but that its abundance is also affected by direct density-dependent processes acting over weekly time scales. Adult predation during both colonization and dispersal are likely processes yielding these dynamics.									25	0	0	0	21	0	25			1438-3896			WOS:000229109900008		
J	Schultz, TD								The utilization of patchy thermal microhabitats by the ectothermic insect predator, Cicindela sexguttata								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				23	4			444	450		10.1046/j.1365-2311.1998.00154.x				NOV 1998	1998	1. Tiger beetles (Cicindela) of open habitats have served as model ectotherms in studies of the dependence of activity and habitat utilization on temperature. Potential departures from the cicindelid model were investigated in Cicindela sexguttata, a species inhabiting forests where thermal resources are patchy and ephemeral.2. Body temperatures (Tb) were determined by inserting thermocouples into beetles immediately after observing specific behaviours in the field. Cicindela sexguttata elevated Tb by basking, foraged at a preferred Tb Of 32.8 degrees C, and stilted, sun-faced, or sought shade when Tb exceeded 35 degrees C. Although these behaviours were typical of Cicinclela, their set points were lower than those of species in more open habitats.3. Illuminated substrates were utilized for basking and foraging. Beetles were dispersed throughout the forest floor in early spring, but became aggregated in light gaps when the canopy leafed out. Operative temperatures of thermal models indicated that beetles were unable to maintain the preferred Tb in shade and would not be able to maintain a preferred Tb in light gaps during the autumn, when adults are normally in diapause.4. Beetles were confined to foraging in light gaps once the canopy was closed. Foraging rate and searching speed were independent of Tb, in contrast to other cicindelids. Adults rarely searched for prey, but ambushed small arthropods that alighted in the light gap. Dependence on patches of illumination as thermal resources may increase prey capture, intraspecific encounters, and risk of predation, and preclude foraging in the autumn when Cicindela species of open habitats are also active.									26	0	0	0	22	0	26			0307-6946			WOS:000077282800012

S. compacta and S. manchuricus are univoltine with direct embryonic development and slow nymphal growth during 311 and 294 days, respectively, including the growth at low water temperatures in winter. The life history of S. compacta was characterized by the synchronous emergence and recruitment of its population, continuous increase in the nymphal body weight from May to September, rapid growth in October-November, and the sustained weight gain during winter months until emergence in April-May The life history of S. manchuricus was distinguished by the long-term emergence in May-July and the recruitment of the population from July to September, as well as by a wide range of age-length features, presumably related to the specificity of the reproductive system in adults and an external delay of the nymphal growth of early instars at high water temperature in late summer and early autumn. Nymphs of S. manchuricus grow actively at 0.2 degrees C in winter providing a competitive advantage for this species over S. compacta and K. exilis. The growth of the latter slowed down or was absent in winter months. The semivoltine life history of K exilis, with a diapause in the embryonic development during 9 months lasted about 4 years with the underwent winter nymphal quiescence from December to February. The extended emergence and oviposition were registered from the end of July to September. The structure of the K. exilis population is complex; it is represented by 3 cohorts, the sizes of which were overlapped due to the extended flight period and recruitment of the population with nymphs of a new generation in the spring of the next year. Stoneflies K exilis grow fast in warm time, when S. compacta and S. manchuricus just appeared in the stream, or interrupted their growth at relatively high water temperatures in summer. The annual production of three species varied from 0.045 to 0.383 g DM/m(2), P/B-annual was 1.1-6.9; P/B-cohort = 6.2-9.1, and P/B-year = 4.1-9.4. The low values of P/B-annual and P/B-year were found in semivoltine K exilis, and high ones - in univoltine S. compacta. The latter had the higher cohort specific growth rate; its specific production was 0.026 day(-)1. In the K exilis population, the cohort specific growth rate (0.013 day(-1)) and specific production (0.004 day(-1)) were characterized by the low values. The highest production was observed in the S. manchuricus population, where nymphs grew with the specific rate of 0.023 day(-1), and their average density reached 59 ind./m(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0044-5134			WOS:000352248000005

GTLAUS is not a prediction model for practical plant protection, bur a tool for analysis of the interaction of different pest and antagonist densities and ecological effects of changing climate and other environmental conditions. The model contains three submodels: wheat ontogenesis, popular-ion dynamics of the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae (FABR.), and population dynamics and predation of aphid-specific predators, especially Coccinella septempunctata L. Several functions for certain features, e.g. grain yield loss and aphid mortality due to parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi, were also incorporated into the model. A large number of scenario runs with various initial population densities and different weather regimes were analyzed to quantify aphid population development under certain conditions and antagonist potential for natural control. Age structure variation in the initial aphid population leads to markable differences in population growth race. Temperatures 3K higher than the long-term German mean temperature were found to give especially C. septempunctata a relative predatory advantage compared with aphid multiplication. Natural control, therefore, increases even clearly so. The model calculations also showed that the impact of beneficials varies greatly, depending primarily on aphid density and temperature. Lower temperatures may favour aphids for seasons of prolonged wheat ripening and weaker predator activity.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0340-8159			WOS:A1996VV72600013

Food demands of the predatory carabid Notiophilus biguttatus F. and their fulfilment were studied in the laboratory and field.2. In the laboratory, larval consumption, growth, adult body size and egg production were established for different regimes of temperature and food, the springtail Orchesella cincta.3. Temperature strongly influenced feeding rate of larvae and adults and consequently growth and oviposition rates. Accordingly, growth rate and oviposition rate increased with prey supply.4. Prey supply also had an effect on fat content, but the number of ripe eggs in the ovaries was related neither to temperature nor to prey supply.5. Adult body size was affected by temperature during the larval period but more so by food supply.6. Dissection of field fresh females showed them to bear eggs for the whole year, except in late winter/early spring and in July.7. Fat content was low in spring and, from July on, high in summer and autumn. Survivorship during starvation differed widely between samples and seemed to be related to reproductive status rather than to fat content.8. Samples of beetles and springtails from eleven pine plantations revealed for the beetles significant differences in fat content and body size, the latter ranging between the maximum and minimum value obtained in the laboratory.9. Conclusions about food limitation based on body size and fat content were not corroborated by a relationship of these indices with springtail density.									42	0	2	0	40	0	44			0307-6946			WOS:A1992HL13100005		
J	Iwasaki, Hiroki; Suda, Daisuke; Watanabe, Mamoru								Foraging Activity of Sympetrum infuscatum (Selys) Adults Living in Satoyama Forest Gaps (Odonata: Libellulidae).								JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY				53	4			165	171		10.1303/jjaez.2009.165				2009	2009	Adult Sympetrum infuscatum (Selys) live in the forest gaps throughout their life except when visiting rice paddy fields for oviposition. They prey on small flying insects in the forest gaps, using sit-and-wait tactics. They perch on the tips of branches or grass all day and take off when a small flying insect comes into sight. In the present study, the foraging behavior of S. infuscatum in the forest gaps was observed. The perching height was high in the morning and evening and low around noon. The diurnal change in the perching height corresponded to the abundance of flying small insects. The mean daily frequency of foraging flights was 251 for females and 182 for males, and the mean actual number of insects captured was 109 and 89, respectively. A total of 2,935,300 small flying insects were preyed on by S. infuscatum adults during one day in the Satomaya forest gaps.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0021-4914	1347-6068		WOS:000274003600004		
J	Broomhall, SD								Egg temperature modifies predator avoidance and the effects of the insecticide endosulfan on tadpoles of an Australian frog								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				41	1			105	113		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2004.00883.x				FEB 2004	2004	1. Attention is shifting from simplistic explanations of global amphibian declines that posit a single cause (such as climate change, pesticide contamination or disease) to more complex scenarios that involve interactive effects. Temperature is a pervasive influence on frog development, particularly during the egg and larval stages. However, the effect of temperatures experienced early in ontogeny on later larval behaviour or response to agrochemicals is little known.2. Eggs of the Australian frog Limnodynastes peronii were reared at two temperatures that simulate naturally occurring cool and warm temperature regimes (14 +/- 3degreesC and 20 +/- 3degreesC). Tadpoles were then exposed to sublethal concentrations of the organochlorine insecticide endosulfan, at a common temperature. Endosulfan often contaminates aquatic environments, yet its effects on Australian frogs are unknown. Tadpoles reduced feeding after 48 h of exposure to endosulfan concentrations that occur in the field (both 0.03 mug l(-1) and 1.3 mug l(-1)). Feeding remained depressed at 1.3 mug l(-1) endosulfan up to 9 days after tadpoles were transferred to endosulfan-free water.3. Egg-rearing temperature and endosulfan interacted to affect tadpole length. Further, tadpoles exposed to endosulfan were significantly shorter than control tadpoles. They were also more vulnerable to capture by an invertebrate (odonate) predator than controls of the same size when tested 9 days after transfer to clean water. While warm egg-rearing temperatures significantly decreased vulnerability to capture, tadpoles were proportionally more adversely affected by endosulfan. Thus, egg-rearing temperature altered predator avoidance and changed the way in which endosulfan affected growth. Moreover, endosulfan significantly decreased feeding, growth and predator avoidance.4. Synthesis and applications. Not only can short-term exposure to endosulfan at levels within regulatory guidelines and frequently reported in natural waterbodies influence tadpole viability, but the sensitivity of the tadpoles to this effect depends upon the thermal regimes that they encounter over their first few days of life. These data therefore suggest that existing water quality prescriptions may not provide adequate protection, while also illustrating how aspects of climate and thermal regimes might interact with pesticides to have cumulative effects on amphibian fitness.									78	2	0	0	74	0	81			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000188541900010

In aposematic wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) larvae, the size of a warning signal (orange patch on black body) varies phenotypically and genetically. Although a large warning signal is favored as an antipredator defense, we hypothesized that thermoregulation may constrain the signal size in colder habitats. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a factorial rearing experiment with two selection lines for larval coloration (small and large signal) and with two temperature manipulations (high and low temperature environment). Temperature constrained the size and brightness of the warning signal. Larvae with a small signal had an advantage in the colder environment, which was demonstrated by a faster development time and growth rate in the low temperature treatment, compared to larvae with a large signal. Interestingly, the larvae with a small signal were found more often on the plant than the ones with a large signal, suggesting higher basking activity of the melanic (small signal) individuals in the low temperature. We conclude that the expression of aposematic display is not only defined by its efficacy against predators; variation in temperature may constrain evolution of a conspicuous warning signal and maintain variation in it.									76	2	0	0	71	0	78			0014-3820	1558-5646		WOS:000263254000014	19154362

In most instances, these development studies are based on single species reared in isolation in the laboratory. This study examined the impact of excretions and secretions (ES) associated with third-instar Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart), a predator, on the development of its prey, Cochliomyia macellaria (F.). Not surprisingly, Ch. rufifacies ES did not impact the development of first-or second-instar C. macellaria, which are typically not preyed on by Ch. rufifacies. However, development of thirdinstar C. macellaria, which do experience predation, was impacted. First, larvae were longer than those in the control (deionized water, dH(2)O). Filtering the ES and removing the associated bacteria and byproducts > 0.2 mu m dampened the previous impact observed by the unfiltered ES on third-instar C. macellaria. Second, third-instar C. macellaria treated with unfiltered ES completed pupariation 8 h quicker than the controls. Filtering the ES lessened this effect by 50%. And finally, third-instar C. macellaria treated with filtered or unfiltered Ch. rufifacies ES reached adulthood similar to 5 h faster than controls treated with dH(2)O. In summary, these data have large ramifications for forensic entomology, as multiple species being present on decomposing remains is not uncommon. Understanding the impact of associated ES produced by interspecific cohorts on associated development could lead to more precise estimates of the minimum postmortem interval for forensic investigation of decomposing remains.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0022-2585	1938-2928		WOS:000409133700011	28541462

Several exceptions to this expectation have been identified, however, and it is vital that we understand the underlying mechanisms if we are to improve our ability to predict future trends. Here, we used a natural warming experiment in Iceland and quantitative theoretical predictions to investigate the success of brown trout as top predators across a stream temperature gradient (4-25 degrees C). Brown trout are at the northern limit of their geographic distribution in this system, with ambient stream temperatures below their optimum for maximal growth, and above it in the warmest streams. A five-month mark-recapture study revealed that population abundance, biomass, growth rate, and production of trout all increased with stream temperature. We identified two mechanisms that contributed to these responses: (1) trout became more selective in their diet as stream temperature increased, feeding higher in the food web and increasing in trophic position; and (2) trophic transfer through the food web was more efficient in the warmer streams. We found little evidence to support a third potential mechanism: that external subsidies would play a more important role in the diet of trout with increasing stream temperature. Resource availability was also amplified through the trophic levels with warming, as predicted by metabolic theory in nutrient-replete systems. These results highlight circumstances in which top predators can thrive in warmer environments and contribute to our knowledge of warming impacts on natural communities and ecosystem functioning.									35	1	0	0	26	0	35			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000381077300021	26936833

To determine factors affecting White Perch abundance and size structure, we compared White Perch growth, timing of maturity, and trophic level; the abundance of a predator (Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides); the abundance of an ecologically significant mid-level omnivore (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum); prey availability (chironomid and zooplankton abundances); and environmental variables (specific conductivity, Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen concentration, and temperature) among four reservoirs (two with high White Perch abundance and two with low abundance). White Perch size structure was closely tied to abundance, with truncated size structure as abundance increased. Among the other variables we tested, only Largemouth Bass abundance had a significant (negative) relationship with White Perch abundance. White Perch size structure appeared to be highly density dependent, and variables that commonly explain variation in abundance of introduced fishes did not explain differences in the four White Perch populations we studied. Further study of the competitive and predatory interactions of White Perch and Largemouth Bass over ontogeny could shed light on the mechanism(s) potentially shaping population structure of the two species where they coexist.

The population in the study area was estimated using capture, mark and release method whereas food habits of the species were studied by analysis of stomach contents. The results showed the highest average population was found during August 2009 (93.10 +/- 18.64 /ha) while the lowest from December 2008 to February 2009. Maximum seasonal populations existed in summer 2009, whereas winter 2008 sizes were at a minimum. Stomach content analysis of the species revealed percent frequency (%F) of occurrence of insects (80.3), earthworms (28.5), whole frogs (15.8), bone pieces (22.5), rodents (1.66), vegetation (5.0), soil particles (13.3) and some unidentified material (7.5) in all the stomach samples. Most frequently consumed prey items were insects (30% by volume), although frogs also preyed upon conspecifics and rodents. Insects recovered from the stomach contents were identified as belonging to Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Odonata and Homoptera as well as the class Archnida. Insects recovered from the stomach contents were compared to those captured from the study area.									6	1	0	0	8	0	8			2095-0357			WOS:000293037600008

We tested whether the risk of overheating may limit parental provisioning of an aerial insectivorous bird in population decline. For many seasonally breeding birds, parents are thought to operate close to an energetic ceiling during the 2-3 week chick-rearing period. The factors determining the ceiling remain unknown, although it may be set by an individual's capacity to dissipate body heat (the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis). Over two breeding seasons we experimentally trimmed the ventral feathers of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to provide a thermal window. We then monitored maternal and paternal provisioning rates, nestling growth rates and fledging success. We found the effect of our experimental treatment was context dependent. Females with an enhanced capacity to dissipate heat fed their nestlings at higher rates than controls when conditions were hot, but the reverse was true under cool conditions. Control females and their mates both reduced foraging under hot conditions. In contrast, male partners of trimmed females maintained a constant feeding rate across temperatures, suggesting attempts to match the feeding rate of their partners. On average, nestlings of trimmed females were heavier than controls, but did not have a higher probability of fledging. We suggest that removal of a thermal constraint allowed females to increase provisioning rates, but additionally provided nestlings with a thermal advantage via increased heat transfer during maternal brooding. Our data provide support for the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis and suggest that depending on temperature, heat dissipation capacity can influence reproductive success in aerial insectivores.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000541845400014	32321750

Coelophora inaequalis could complete its life cycle feeding on T. citricida at these two temperatures. The developmental period from egg to adult was significantly longer at 20 degrees C (24.7 d) than at 25 degrees C (15.9 d). The survivorship of combined immature stages were higher at 25 degrees C (39.2%) than at 20 degrees C (34.3%).2 The effects of prey densities (4-64 aphids per leaf disk) on the functional responses of C. inaequalis fourth-instar larvae and female adults were investigated using grapefruit leaf disks over a 24-h period at 25 degrees C and a photoperiod of LD 14 : 10 h. Logistic regression analyses indicated that fourth-instar larvae and adults exhibited a type II functional response to aphid density. Fourth-instar larvae had a higher search rate (0.1305) than C. inaequalis female adults (0.0989). The handling time of fourth-instar larvae (30.4 min) was significantly longer than that of female adults (5.8 min). Collectively, C. inaequalis appears to be a promising biological control agent of T. citricida in the citrus groves.									33	5	0	0	28	0	37			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000208951800010

Recent studies have shown that species have shifted from high-elevation areas to low ones because the rise in temperature has increased rainfall. These outcomes challenge the existing hypothesis about the responses of species to climate change.Methodology/Principal Findings: With the use of data on the biological characteristics and reproductive behavior of Cephalantheropsis obcordata in Luofu Mountain, Guangdong, China, trends in the population size of the species were predicted based on several factors. The response of C. obcordata to climate change was verified by integrating it with analytical findings on meteorological data and an artificially simulated environment of water change. The results showed that C. obcordata can grow only in waterlogged streams. The species can produce fruit with many seeds by insect pollination; however, very few seeds can burgeon to become seedlings, with most of those seedlings not maturing into the sexually reproductive phase, and grass plants will die after reproduction. The current population's age pyramid is kettle-shaped; it has a Deevey type I survival curve; and its net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, as well as finite rate of increase are all very low. The population used in the artificial simulation perished due to seasonal drought.Conclusions:The change in rainfall patterns caused by climate warming has altered the water environment of C. obcordata in Luofu Mountain, thereby restricting seed burgeoning as well as seedling growth and shortening the life span of the plant. The growth rate of the C. obcordata population is in descending order, and models of population trend predict that the population in Luofu Mountain will disappear in 23 years.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000301353900014	22253763

The ladybeetle Oenopia conglobata (L.) is a natural enemy of many herbivores, particularly aphids. The temperature-dependent development of O. conglobata was studied at six constant temperatures (22.5, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5 and 35 degrees C) to understand its development rate and environmental constraints better. Linear and nonlinear (Lactin) models were fitted to the data. In the thermal range from 22.5 to 32.5 degrees C, the rate of development increased for all stages; 35 degrees C was lethal for all stages and no eggs hatched. The Tb and K values for the biological cycle (egg-adult) were 8.84 degrees C and 263.15 DD, respectively. Depending on the model, t(min) values for the total development time of the coccinellid ranged from 8.45 to 8.82 degrees C. The nonlinear model of Lactin estimated the optimum and upper temperature thresholds for the total development time of the ladybeetle to be 33.2 and 35.0 degrees C, respectively. High R-2 values and low residual sum of squares values revealed a good fit to the experimental data for total development and different developmental stages of O. conglobata. The results may contribute to the improvement of practical methods for mass rearing of O. conglobata.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1742-7584	1742-7592		WOS:000447805900018

This predator was reared at constant temperatures of 20, 23, 25, 28, 30 and 33 +/- 0.2 degreesC, all at relative humidity of 60 +/- 10%, and a photoperiod of L: D 14: 10. Fecundity of P. nigrispinus at the various temperatures ranged from 401.2 (33degreesC) to 841.3 (28degreesC) eggs/female. The preoviposition, oviposition peak, and declining oviposition periods of P. nigrispinus were affected by temperature [ preoviposition period: 4.0 (33degreesC) to 13.2 (20degreesC) days; duration of oviposition peak period: 9.0 (33degreesC) to 33.0 (20degreesC) days; and duration of declining oviposition period: 16.0 (33degreesC) to 46.0 (20degreesC) days]. Longevity of females and males of P. nigrispinus ranged from 28.4 (33degreesC) to 88.6 (20degreesC) days, and from 42.7 (33degreesC) to 114.3 (20degreesC) days, respectively. These data are useful in relation to the development of population dynamics models to underpin programmes of biological control.									12	0	0	0	9	3	12			1386-6141			WOS:000186272500006

Carabids were monitored at Ahuriri Scenic Reserve, Port Hills, Canterbury, from August 2007 to September 2008 using pitfall traps. Carabid captures, species richness and distribution across the reserve were compared with those found in a similar study in 1977-1978. Monthly carabid captures were highly correlated with average temperature in both studies. There was little evidence of carabids responding to habitat factors, such as leaf litter depth, pH or ground cover. However, Megadromus antarcticus was positively associated with canopy openness and ground cover, whereas Holcaspis angustula was more abundant where canopy cover was extensive and there was a relatively high incidence of bare rock. Thirteen species of carabid were recorded in 1977-1978, of which six were absent, four had decreased, one was stable and two species increased in abundance from collections made in 2007-2008. The loss of one Banks Peninsula and five New Zealand endemic beetle species from this reserve is of concern, and future work should aim to gain more detailed information on the habitat requirements of these species to assist conservation management strategies.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0301-4223	1175-8821		WOS:000472104200002

Free-living insects are often thought of as more vulnerable to environmental hazards than concealed insects, such as galling or mining insects. The possibility that larvae of the free-living leaf beetle Galerucella lineola seek out existing plant structures and thereby become partly concealed was explored.2. Neonate larvae of G. lineola frequently feed in rolled-in margins of young leaves of their host plant, Salix viminalis. In addition to nutritional benefits from feeding on young leaves, larvae may also gain protection against adverse weather conditions and general predators by feeding in the leaf rolls. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses.3. Artificial shelters were constructed and cohorts of neonate larvae were placed on experimental plants. In all experiments, larvae preferred to feed in shelters, even when shelters were constructed on mature leaves.4. In one of the experiments, fewer larvae disappeared when shelters were provided. In a predator exclusion experiment, however, no differences in predator-inflicted mortality on G, lineola were found between shelter-containing shoots and control shoots.5. A laboratory experiment showed increased protection from desiccation when shelters were present; growth rate was higher for larvae feeding on plants with shelters.6. Thus, free-living insects may not always be as exposed to environmental hazards as is often assumed. In particular, young larvae may take advantage of preformed structures on their host plant and feed in a concealed microhabitat. Because mortality, in general, is high during early instars, shelter-seeking behaviour may increase survival significantly. The existence of preformed shelters may therefore be a plant characteristic that should be considered when exploring the environmental risks associated with the free-living habit.									51	0	0	0	53	1	56			0307-6946			WOS:A1997YK36200011

Members of this genus have several traits that characterize valuable natural enemies and studies of their life histories are needed to assess their potential usefulness in biological control. In outdoor rearings in southeastern Brazil, Chrysopodes (Chrysopodes) lineafrons Adams and Penny underwent development and reproduction without interruption or dormancy; it produced eight full generations in slightly more than one year (375 days). Under a series of constant temperatures between 28.5 and 18 degrees C, the life cycle (oviposition-adult emergence) ranged from 27 to 64 days, whereas a constant temperature slightly below 15 degrees C prevented development. Developmental rates were linearly related to temperature; preimaginal development was completed within 470 degree-days above a lower thermal threshold of 10.7 degrees C; the rates of development under fluctuating temperatures outdoors closely reflected the developmental responses to constant temperatures indoors. Reproductive performance appeared highest at 25 degrees C; at this temperature, females oviposited 10 days after emergence, at a rate of similar to 9 eggs per day, for a total of similar to 200 eggs per individual. A comparison of Ch. (Ch.) lineafrons with other green lacewing species indicated that this predator has potential as a native natural enemy in Neotropical orchards and may be readily amenable to continuous mass-rearing.

However, it is unclear how the effects will quantitatively differ between the plant-herbivore and herbivore-carnivore interface. To test how warming could differentially affect rates of herbivory and carnivory, we studied trophic interaction strength in a food chain comprised of green algae, herbivorous rotifers and carnivorous rotifers at 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. We found significant warming-induced changes in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous rotifers, but these responses occurred at different parts of the entire temperature gradient. The strongest response of the per capita herbivore's ingestion rate occurred due to an increase in temperature from 15 to 20 degrees C (1.9 fold: from 834 to 1611 algal cells per h(-1)) and of the per capita carnivore's ingestion rate from 20 to 25 degrees C (1.6 fold: from 1.5 to 2.5 prey h(-1)). Handling time, an important component of a consumer's functional response, significantly decreased from 15 to 20 degrees C in herbivorous rotifers. In contrast, it decreased from 20 to 25 degrees C in carnivorous rotifers. Attack rates significantly and strongly increased from 10 to 25 degrees C in the herbivorous animals, but not at all in the carnivores. Our results exemplify how the relative forces of top-down control exerted by herbivores and carnivores may strongly shift under global warming. But warming, and its magnitude, are not the only issue: If our results would prove to be representative, shifts in ectotherm interactions will quantitatively differ when a 5 degrees C increase starts out from a low, intermediate or high initial temperature. This would imply that warming could have different effects on the relative forces of carnivory and herbivory in habitats differing in average temperature, as would exist at different altitudes and latitudes.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1932-6203			WOS:000336656000011	24797506

Hypotheses based on physical constraints or behavioural plasticity predict relationships between the speed and the tortuosity of running, which should affect the thermal sensitivity of locomotion.We measured the speed and tortuosity of running by leaf-cutter ants over a range of temperatures from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Tortuosity was estimated by the fractal dimension of each path.As we expected, ants ran faster at higher temperatures, but they also followed straighter (less tortuous) paths. A negative relationship between speed and tortuosity was observed both within and among thermal environments.Both biomechanical and behavioural mechanisms might have caused the observed relationship. Turning at high speeds should be more difficult because of the force needed to overcome inertia, and turning at low speeds could help ants evade a predator. Staged encounters with predators should help to define the ecological significance of the trade-off between speed and tortuosity.									26	0	0	0	24	1	26			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000252443600010

Obata (Rubiaceae). This study evaluated sampling methods, seasonality and diversity of the hemerobiids associated to Coffea arabica L. cv. Obata over a one-year period in Cravinhos, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The collecting methods were: sweeping net, light trap and Moericke trap. 489 hemerobiids belonging to four genera, were collected: Nusalala (231 individuals / 47.2% of the hemerobiids collected), Megalomus (110 / 22.5%), Hemerobius (104 / 21.3%) and Sympherobius (44 / 9%). The sweeping net seems to be the most efficient method of sampling to capture Hemerobiidae and the Moericke trap presented the higher value of diversity (H'= 0,56) and equitability (J= 0,93). The hemerobiids were recorded in the area along the entire year. The highest abundance occurred from August to March (end of winter, spring and summer) and the population peak was in January (mid-summer). Megalomus presented positive and significant correlations (p< 0.05) with the rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures; Nusalala with the maximum and minimum temperatures and Sympherobius only with the maximum temperature.									5	0	0	0	4	6	6			0085-5626	1806-9665		WOS:000254448900020

The beetles were fed on Aphis gossypii Glover and were maintained at 70 +/- 10% RH and a 14:10 (L:D) h photoperiod. According to the age-stage, two-sex life table, the net reproductive rates (R-0) were 147.4, 98.7, and 62.5 offspring for beetles kept at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, we employed both the jackknife and bootstrap techniques for estimating the means, variances, and standard errors of the population parameters. The sample means of R-0 and the other population parameters obtained using the bootstrap technique fit a normal distribution, but the jackknife technique generated biologically meaningless zero values for R-0. The net predation rates were 10963, 13050, and 7492 aphids for beetles kept at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, respectively. For a comprehensive comparison of predation potential, we incorporated both the finite rate and the predation rate into the finite predation rate. When both the growth rate and the predation rate were considered, our results showed that H. dimidiata is a more efficient biological control agent for A. gossypii at 20 and 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C.

The benefits of rapid growth an obvious, so the problem is to explain the costs and tradeoffs that cause organisms to grow below their physiological maximum. Four prevailing themes emerge from the literature: (1) slow growth is adaptive for dealing with nutrient stress, (2) the tradeoff between growth rate and development limits growth in species that require mature function early in life, (3) rapid growth evolves when a minimum size must be reached quickly, such as for sexual maturation or over wintering and (4) rapid growth may evolve to compensate for slowed growth owing to environmental conditions. Evidence for each of these themes is detailed for plants, homoiotherms, and poikilotherms. In addition, empirical evidence is reviewed costs of rapid gr growth, including increased fluctuating asymmetry, reduced immune capacity, and reduced ability to respond to environmental stress.									770	11	1	0	750	2	786			0033-5770	1539-7718		WOS:A1997XB52900003

Bat foraging activity was quantified along five transects representing three different habitat types using acoustic monitoring and captures with mist nets and harp traps. Aerial insect abundance was assessed using a light trap; in addition shrub and tree arthropods were sampled. Bat activity was significantly and positively related to insect availability and ambient temperature, whereas increased visibility of the moon had a negative influence on flight activity. Together, these factors best explained both total bat activity and activity of bats hunting in open space and edge habitats. The interaction between temperature and light intensity was the best predictor of activity by species foraging in obstacle-rich forest habitats, however, the regression model had a low predictive value. Overall, a large proportion (c. 50%) of the variation in bat activity appeared to be a consequence of transect- and/or habitat-specific influences. We found a significant non-linear relationship between the activity of QCF (quasi-constant frequency) and FM-QCF (frequency modulated quasi-constant frequency) bats and the phase of the moon, with lowest levels of activity occurring near full moon. We interpret this lunar-phobic behaviour as a reflection of a higher predation risk during moonlit periods. For FM (steep frequency modulated) and CF (constant frequency) bats, no significant correlation was found, although there was a trend suggesting that these bats at least were not negatively affected by bright moonlight. Foraging activity of bats was positively correlated with the abundance of atympanate moths; however, no such correlation was found for tympanate moths.									54	2	0	0	53	0	56			0266-4674	1469-7831		WOS:000222985200005

Here we evaluate experimentally two alternative hypotheses suggested to explain life history shifts induced by raised temperature using parthenogenetic clones from two Daphnia species. Explanation 1 proposes that the life history shifts could be adaptive if increased temperature is used as an indirect cue to indicate increased risk from size-selective predators. Explanation 2 proposes that at larger body size energy becomes more limiting as temperature increases because of a less favourable assimilation: metabolism balance. In a factorial laboratory experiment we examine the effects of three rearing temperatures on the growth and reproductive traits of Daphnia raised in water with fish kairomone, Chaoborus kairomone, or in uncontaminated water. None of the three predictions of explanation 1 were met by the data. In both D. pulex and D. curvirostris, and some other published studies, data suggested that at larger body sizes the sum of growth and reproduction was lower at high temperature, supporting our prediction from explanation 2. However, we propose a novel third explanation based on new evidence of temperature-dependence in both reproductive effort and cost in D. pulex.									37	1	0	0	33	0	38			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000188987800001

Between 2010 and 2013, sea turtle nests were rarely observed suggesting that nesting events along the Mauritanian coast were sporadic and scattered. In September 2011, a nest of C. mydas on the beach near the Diawling National Park with 36 eggs was translocated to an enclosure at Mouily locality. This was the first attempt to establish an optimal translocation procedure along the Mauritanian coast. In October 2014, a total of 127 C. mydas nests or nesting activities were recorded of which 99 were closely inspected. The majority of the nests were located on the beach between 28 and 65 km south of Nouakchott. Embryos from most nests were estimated to be within 30 days of their emergence, but three were estimated to be at the start of their embryonic development. From August until October 2015, one Caretta caretta and 25 C. mydas nesting activities were recorded. Numerous tracks of African golden wolves, ghost crabs and humans were recorded around sea turtle nests suggesting predation and poaching activity on their eggs. During our study we noticed that sea turtles are readily captured and killed onshore and offshore by local fishermen and natives who still use their meat, fat and eggs for various purposes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-3375			WOS:000425154800006

The established phenological data are referred to the unusually high winter temperatures.The variability of body weights found in 2nd and 3rd instars, and the temporal overlapping of all three larval stages confirm the hypothesis that encounters with adequate prey clusters in winter are unpredictable for the larvae.Second and third instar larvae covered distances of some tens of meters. With respect to the 2nd instars, it could be shown that they can maintain their movement in a specific direction for many days. This movement and the displacement velocity appeared to correlate with the unfavourable feeding states of the larvae. Nevertheless, further factors influencing the movement pattern are discussed.Low temperature activity in our latitudes evidently enables the winter larvae of C. problematicus to develop and disperse even under the sub-optimal field conditions in winter. Obviously, the larvae benefit from favourable weather and feeding conditions, even if these are of limited duration.									10	0	1	0	8	0	11			0031-4056			WOS:A1992HY92500004

Identified prey came from two insect orders (Diptera and Hymenoptera), with Hymenoptera making up 88%. Mating occurred in the male over female position and oviposition was in the ground, typically in the shade of vegetation or a shaded depression in the ground when the sun was shining. This species exhibited a distinct daily rhythm of activity for feeding, mating, and oviposition. Grooming behavior resembled that described for other species of Asilidae. Habitats, resting behavior, and predators and parasites also are discussed.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1302-0250			WOS:000353366200001
