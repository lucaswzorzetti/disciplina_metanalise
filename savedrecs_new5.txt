EL KEROUMI, Abderrahim/0000-0001-6293-9193			First study of Diptera seasonal dynamics and their community structure in Moroccan vineyards								AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY				28	2			312	328		10.4001/003.028.0312				SEP 2020	2020	The purpose of this study was to describe the structure and composition of Diptera in Moroccan vineyard, using wet-traps sampling technique throughout 2017. The study focused on five varieties within Loudaya vineyard (west region of Marrakech, Morocco). Eleven different fly species were identified belonging to 10 families, Ceratitis capitata, Drosophilla suzukii and Thaumatiya notata were the most abundant species and first time behaviourally dominant flies species. In addition, more flies were captured in the local varieties (10 579 individuals) than in the introduced ones (966). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in fly richness, evenness and diversity between varieties. Fly community structure in Loudaya showed a clear seasonal dynamics, which richness, abundance, diversity and evenness were significantly (P < 0.001) dissimilar among months. Furthermore, Diptera species were positively influenced by humidity and rainfall. Richness (expected by sample-based rarefaction) and diversity peaked in the middle of vineyard phenology, corresponding to mid-spring to late-summer in all varieties. Fly species occurrence and seasonal climatic variation in Loudaya vineyard might be among various ecological factors such as habitat distribution, climate and the availability of resources. Taking into account the periods of fly abundance, the survey could give relevant indications on new approaches to integrated pest management (IPM) in Moroccan vineyards, particularly in the Loudaya region.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1021-3589	1026-4914		WOS:000575904500010		
J	Klok, CJ; Chown, SL				Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011	Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105			Assessing the benefits of aggregation: thermal biology and water relations of anomalous Emperor Moth caterpillars								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				13	3			417	427		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00324.x				JUN 1999	1999	1. Three hypotheses have been proposed to account for the maintenance of aggregation behaviour in caterpillars. While the benefits of aggregation for defence and for the elevation of growth rates have been investigated in some species, both of these hypotheses have been criticized, and in many cases the alternative hypothesis regarding the benefits of physiological regulation has not been investigated.2. In this paper the field thermal biology and water relations of solitary caterpillars (instars IV-V) and aggregations of caterpillars (instars I-III) are examined in Imbrasia belina (Westwood) (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), a species where an instar-related change in aggregation behaviour is obligatory (instars I-III always aggregate, instars IV-V are always solitary), and where the benefits of defence and of overwhelming inducible host plant defences are unlikely to be significant.3. Aggregations of instars II-III maintain body temperatures equivalent to those of larger solitary individuals of instars IV and V, but significantly higher than those of operative models of single caterpillars of instars II-III. In addition, behavioural thermoregulation is not used to elevate body temperatures, although hanging behaviour takes place when upper lethal temperature limits are approached. Nonetheless, solar radiation has a marked influence on the temperature of aggregations because of the accumulation of higher heat loads by the larger masses of large aggregations.4. Instars IV-V can survive higher temperatures than instars I-III, and this may be because of their accumulation of very high heat loads in the field. Instars I and LII can avoid these high heat loads by partial dispersal from the aggregation. In contrast, instars I-III have significantly lower critical thermal minima than the later instars, which may allow larvae to regain aggregations if they are separated from them.5. Water loss rates of real aggregations, of a given size, within a particular instar are lower than the sum of the rates of the same number of individual caterpillars of the same instar. In addition, survival of water loss tends to be higher in individuals from aggregations than in single individuals.6. Using this evidence in conjunction with studies that demonstrate significant predation in all instars, aggregation in the early instars irrespective of whether outbreaks take place or not, and the absence of inducible defences in the major host (Colophospermum mopane) of I. belina, it is concluded that physiological regulation, of temperature and water balance, is the most likely explanation for the maintenance of aggregation behaviour in this species.									75	0	1	0	69	1	79			0269-8463			WOS:000081534300015		
J	Mendo, Jaime; Wolff, Matthias								El Impacto De El Niño Sobre La Producción De Concha De Abanico (Argopecten Purpuratus) En Bahía Independencia, Pisco, Perú								Ecología Aplicada				2	1			51	57						2003-01	2003	Independencia Bay can be considered as one of the most productive invertebrate fishing grounds worldwide. One of the most important exploited species is the scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) with strong catching fluctuations related to El Niño and La Niña events and to inadequate management strategies. During strong warming periods annual landings reach up to 50 000t in an area of about 150 km2 and during cold years they remain around 500 to 1000 t. This study analyses the changes in scallop landings at Independencia Bay observed during the last two decades and discusses the main factors affecting the scallop proliferations during the El Niño events. In this way data on landings, sea surface temperature and those related to growth, reproduction, predation, mean density and oxygen concentration from published and unpublished papers are used. The relationship between annual catches and average water temperature over the preceding reproductive period of the scallop over the past 20 year’s period, showed that scallop production is affected positively only with strong El Niño such as those of 1983 and 1998. Our review showed that the scallop stock proliferation can be traced to the combined effect of (1) an increase in reproductive output through an acceleration of gonad maturation and a higher spawning frequency; (2) a shortening of the larval period and an increase in larval survival; (3) an increase in the individual growth performance; (4) an increase in the juvenile and adult survival through reduction of predator biomass; (5) an increase in carrying capacity of the scallop banks due to elevated oxygen levels. When discussing the factors that contribute to the development of the scallop population during an El Niño event, the fishery must be considered in detail. Since the volume of the catch not only depends on the relative abundance of the species, fishing efforts and strategies were analyzed in order to explain different levels of scallop production during El Niño 1983 and 1998.	La Bahía Independencia puede ser considerada a nivel mundial como una de las zonas mas productivas en invertebrados bentónicos, cuyas capturas están sujetas a fluctuaciones fuertes originadas por la ocurrencia del fenómeno El Niño y La Niña y por la falta de medidas de manejo adecuadas. Durante períodos con calentamientos fuertes los desembarques anuales alcanzan las 50000 t en un área de aproximadamente 150 km² y durante años fríos estas se mantienen alrededor de 500 a 1000 t. El presente estudio analiza los cambios de los desembarques en la Bahía Independencia observados durante las dos últimas décadas y discute los principales factores que afectan los "booms" de concha de abanico. En este sentido se usa información sobre capturas, temperatura y aquella relacionada con el crecimiento, reproducción, prelación, densidad media y condiciones de oxígeno procedente de trabajos publicados y no publicados. La relación entre la captura anual y la temperatura promedio durante el periodo reproductivo de la concha de abanico durante los últimos 20 años, muestra que la producción es afectada positivamente solo con la ocurrencia de El Niño fuertes como en 1983 y 1998. Los resultados muestran que los "booms" de concha de abanico durante estos El Niño se debe al efecto combinado de (1) incremento en la actividad reproductiva a través de una aceleración de la maduración y un incremento de la frecuencia de desove; (2) acortamiento del periodo larval e incremento en la supervivencia larval; (3) incremento en el rendimiento en crecimiento individual; (4) incremento en la supervivencia de juveniles y adultos debido a la reducción de la biomasa de predadores; (5) incremento en la capacidad de carga de los bancos de conchas debido a elevados niveles de oxígeno. En el marco de discusión sobre los factores que contribuyen al desarrollo de la población de concha de abanico durante el evento El Niño, no podemos dejar de considerar en detalle el impacto de la pesquería. Considerando que el volumen de captura no solo depende de la abundancia relativa de la especie, la estrategia de pesca aplicada fue analizada con el fin de explicar los diferentes niveles de producción de concha de abanico durante El Niño 1983 y 1998.								16	0	0	0	14	7	17			1726-2216			SCIELO:S1726-22162003000100008

Improved understanding of the influence of environmental conditions on shark attack risk may help to inform shark management strategies. Here, we developed predictive models for the risk of attack by white Carcharodon carcharias, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and bull/ whaler Carcharhinus spp. sharks in Australian waters based on location, sea surface temperature (SST), rainfall, and distance to river mouth. A generalised additive model analysis was performed using shark attack data and randomly generated pseudo-absence non-attack data. White shark attack risk was significantly higher in warmer SSTs, increased closer to a river mouth (<10 km), and peaked at a mean monthly rainfall of 100 mm. Whaler shark attack risk increased significantly within 1 km of a river mouth and peaked in the summer months. Tiger shark attack risk increased significantly with rainfall. We performed additional temporal and spatio-temporal analyses to test the hypothesis that SST anomaly (SSTanom) influences white shark attack risk, and found that attacks tend to occur at locations where there is a lower SSTanom (i.e. the water is relatively cooler) compared to surrounding areas. On the far north coast of eastern Australia- an attack hotspot - a strengthening of the East Australian Current may cause white sharks to move into cooler upwelling waters close to this stretch of the coast and increase the risk of an attack.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000521174300012

We examined the effects of temperature environment on several metamorphic characteristics in three populations of the pool frog (Rana lessonae Camerano, 1882) by rearing individuals at two temperature environments (20 and 25 degrees C). Higher temperature shortened the metamorphic period and reduced the absolute mass loss, although there was no difference between the temperatures in the percentage of mass lost. No differences among the populations were detected, but there was significant intrapopulation variation both in the mean and in the plasticity for the duration of metamorphosis. These results indicate that several aspects of metamorphosis are plastic in amphibians, these traits may have considerable intrapopulation variation, and that temperature is a strong factor affecting the process of metamorphosis.									5	0	2	0	6	0	8			0008-4301			WOS:000272031500004

Because ectotherm locomotor performance depends on temperature, rattlesnakes could use prey temperature to evaluate the potential of lizards to evade attacks. Here, we tested whether hunting rattlesnakes use infrared information to (1) detect and (2) evaluate prey before attack. We expected thermal contrast between prey and background to be the best predictor of predatory behaviour under the prey detection hypothesis, and absolute prey temperature under the prey evaluation hypothesis. We presented lizard carcasses of varying temperatures to free-ranging sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) and scored behavioural responses as a function of thermal contrast, absolute lizard temperature, and light level. Thermal contrast and light level were the most salient predictors of snake behaviour. Snakes were more likely to respond to lizards and/or respond at greater distances at night and when thermal contrast was high, supporting the known prey detection function of infrared sensing. Absolute lizard temperature was not an important predictor of snake behaviour; thus, we found no evidence for temperature-based prey evaluation. Infrared sensing is still poorly understood in ecologically relevant contexts; future research will test whether rattlesnakes learn to evaluate prey based on temperature with experience.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0340-7594	1432-1351		WOS:000425333200004	29218413	
J	Ponsonby, DJ; Copland, MJW								Maximum feeding potential of larvae and adults of the scale insect predator, Chilocorus nigritus with a new method of estimating food intake								BIOCONTROL				45	3			295	310		10.1023/A:1009953005065				SEP 2000	2000	A method of estimating the weight of individual Abgrallaspis cyanophylli (Signoret) without the need for removal from the host plant is described. Using this method, which enables accurate estimations of scale insect weight by measuring length and relating it to a previously determined regression model, maximum feeding potential in male and female Chilocorus nigritus (F.) adults was examined at various constant temperatures over the range of 13 to 30 degrees C and at a cycling temperature of 12 h/12 h at 14/30 degrees C (r.h. in the range of 62 to 68%). Mean daily potential food intake varied from 0.097 mg/day at 13 degrees C to 1.432 mg/day at 30 degrees C. However, intake at the cycling temperature was significantly higher than that at constant temperatures (1.98 mg/day). At 15, 20 and 30 degrees C there were no significant differences between male and female potential food requirements whilst at temperatures in the mid range, there was a considerable increase in female potential voracity when compared to that of the males. Maximum potential larval food requirement for development at 26 degrees C and 62% r.h. in C. nigritus was also estimated using the above method. A mean of 16.24 mg of Abgrallaspis cyanophylli (Signoret) was required for larvae of both sexes to complete development. This study suggests that C. nigritus would be most efficient as a biological control agent if used in glasshouses with a mean daily temperature above 22 degrees C.									10	0	0	0	9	1	10			1386-6141			WOS:000089336400004

Using a comprehensive approach, our study demonstrated a clear pattern in cohort formation of the trochid gastropod population (Umbonium moniliferum) on an intertidal sandflat, southwestern Japan, in the breeding seasons of 2002 and 2007-2009. The study included (1) daily monitoring for spawned eggs and competent larvae in the field and the laboratory, (2) daily and fortnightly monitoring for juveniles, and (3) collection of larvae in the water column and in situ simulation of larval retention, releasing drift cards within an embayment embracing the sandflat. The population with shell widths of 5-14 mm occupied the lower shore in densities of about 1000 inds. m(-2), spawning gametes for lecithotrophic larval development with the shortest duration of 3 d during late September through October. The settlers occurring per day and the newly recruited cohort in the size-frequency distribution were defined as juveniles belonging to the smallest size class (0.20 and 0.21 mm) and to the most left-hand normal-distribution group, respectively. The growth rate was estimated at 0.02 mm d(-1). A synchronous mass egg spawning took place 2-4 d after neap tide, followed by the sequential occurrence of veligers and settlers in high densities, which was completed by the next neap tide, leading to the formation of one newly recruited cohort. Three distinct cohorts were produced consecutively, most probably due to this semilunar cycle. The iteroparous spawning was supposedly performed by the same females. By the following spring, the three cohorts had fused into a single young-of-the-year cohort. Veligers were present across all depth layers in the water column down to 20 m, with a quarter being present within the surface 1 m. Drift cards were driven ashore, with cumulative retrieval rates of 50 and 70% 3 and 9 d after release, respectively, suggesting that hydrodynamics allowed good retention of larvae in the water surface. Using an exponentially decreasing function describing competent larval numbers in a 2 to 9-d period after fertilization in the laboratory, the degree of self-recruitment in the population was assessed under the assumption of complete retention and no mortality of larvae due to predation. The results suggested the presence of some allochthonous subsidy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000279100800004		
J	Maier, G								Daphnia invasion: Population dynamics of Daphnia assemblages in two eutrophic lakes with particular reference to the introduced alien Daphnia ambigua								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				18	11			2001	2015		10.1093/plankt/18.11.2001				NOV 1996	1996	The population dynamics of Daphnia species (D.cucullata, D.ambigua, D.galeata) in two small, productive lakes were studied and experiments with field enclosures were carried out to elucidate the ecological niches of the introduced, alien species D.ambigua. Daphnia ambigua co-existed temporally with the similarly sized D.cucullata, but lived in deeper water. Although both species had the same clutch sizes, similar proportions of ovigerous females: and death rates, D. cucullata was numerically dominant over D.ambigua. This suggests that the observed difference in abundance is simply a result of the slower population growth rates of D.ambigua at lower temperatures in greater depths. The experiments with field enclosures showed that when D.cucullata and D.ambigua were forced to live in the same layer of water, D.ambigua was numerically dominant over D.cucullata both in the enclosures with and without fish. As the difference between the abundances of the two species decreased in the enclosure with fish, D.cucullata seems to be better protected against fish predation than D.ambigua. In the enclosures without fish, D.ambigua and D.cucullata were numerically surpassed by the larger species D.galeata. The present results imply that in some productive lakes with a high fish stock, D.ambigua invaded the niche of D.galeata and that the species can become an important component of the native zooplankton. The results also support the opinion that co-existing Daphnia can have very similar dynamics and niches.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0142-7873			WOS:A1996VX63700002

All time series were exactly dated and spanned 1972 through 1994. In a principal components analysis, the leading principal component (PC1bio) accounted for 64% of the variance in the data set. By entering the upwelling index, the Northern Oscillation index, sea surface temperatures, and the multivariate ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) index into principal components analysis, a time series of environmental variability PC1env was developed for each month of the year. Over the interval 1972 through 1994, PC1bio most strongly correlated with PC1env for February and, to a lesser extent, January and March. Moreover, when each of the six biological time series was related to the 12 PC1env through stepwise multiple regression, February was always the most significant (p < 0.01). The same was true if upwelling index was substituted for PC1env. As upper-trophic predators, rockfish and seabirds independently corroborate that wintertime ocean conditions are critical for productivity in the California Current ecosystem.									40	0	0	0	22	0	41			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000279739900009		
J	Malone, John H.								Ecology of the basin construction reproductive mode in Smilisca sordida (Anura : Hylidae)								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				40	2			230	239		10.1670/140-05A.1				JUN 2006	2006	Basin building, a rare reproductive strategy used by frogs, consists of constructing a depression in the substrate (a basin) and depositing eggs within the basin. The stream breeding Neotropical hylid frog, Smilisca sordida, constructs several types of basins; specifically, eggs deposited in a circular depression either with eggs floating on the surface of the water or with eggs attached to the substrate (open basins) or eggs buried beneath the substrate (a buried basin). Two hypotheses were tested to explain the selective forces maintaining the basin construction reproductive mode in S. sordida. The microenvironment modification hypothesis proposes that basins modify the environment in ways beneficial to developing young. The predator avoidance hypothesis proposes that basins separate and therefore protect embryos and larvae from predators. The thermal prediction of the microenvironment modification hypothesis is supported but only for open basins: buried basins do not modify the thermal environment relative to streams. Fish consume eggs of S. sordida, suggesting that basins provide refuge from fish predation. Field data on predation rates show that, although basin building may reduce predation by fish, plartarians, other invertebrate species, and conspecific tadpoles, all colonize basins and consume eggs of S. sordida. Of 230 clutches, 37.4% experienced total mortality and of clutches that failed, 74.4% were solely caused by predators that colonized basins. The distribution of predators along the stream was nonrandom and the distribution of predators strongly influenced the fate of clutches. Basin desiccation, as well as flooding, caused additional mortality to young and are additional consequences of depositing eggs in basins for S. sordida.									4	0	0	0	5	0	6			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000238621400012

Animals employ various foraging strategies along their ontogeny to acquire energy, and with varying degree of efficiencies, to support growth, maturation and subsequent reproduction events. Individuals that can efficiently acquire energy early are more likely to mature at an earlier age, as a result of faster energy gain which can fuel maturation and reproduction.2. We aimed to test the hypothesis that heritable resource acquisition variation that covaries with efficiency along the ontogeny would influence maturation timing of individuals.3. To test this hypothesis, we utilized Atlantic salmon as a model which exhibits a simple, hence trackable, genetic control of maturation age. We then monitored the variation in diet acquisition (quantified as stomach fullness and composition) of individuals with different ages, and linked it with genomic regions (haploblocks) that were previously identified to be associated with age-at-maturity.4. Consistent with the hypothesis, we demonstrated that one of the life-history genomic regions tested (six6) was indeed associated with age-dependent differences in stomach fullness. Prey composition was marginally linked tosix6, and suggestively (but non-significantly) tovgll3genomic regions. We further showed Atlantic salmon switched to the so-called 'feast and famine' strategy along the ontogeny, where older age groups exhibited heavier stomach content, but that came at the expense of running on empty more often.5. These results suggest genetic variation underlying resource utilization may explain the genetic basis of age structure in Atlantic salmon. Given that ontogenetic diet has a genetic component and the strong spatial diversity associated with these genomic regions, we predict populations with diverse maturation age will have diverse evolutionary responses to future changes in marine food web structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000573020500001

Operational plankton functional type (PET) models, that group plankton according to their biogeochemical properties, are currently being developed to resolve biogenic gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, and to model the lowest trophic levels in fisheries models. A fundamental problem with these models is that PFTs often go extinct in computer simulations, effectively removing the biogeochemical processes from the models. Cropp and Norbury [Cropp, R., Norbury, J., 2009a. Parameterizing plankton functional type models: insights from a dynamical systems perspective. J. Plankton Res. 31, 939-963] demonstrated that parameter combinations that allowed all PFTs to stay extant for all time in stable, homogeneous environments were rare in a PFT model with two competing phytoplankton and one zooplankton (NP(1)P(2)Z). In this paper, we examine the dynamical properties of a generic predator-predator-prey PET model, and apply the analysis techniques developed by Cropp and Norbury to a simple example PFT model with one phytoplankton and two zooplankton (NPZ(1)Z(2)) in order to explore its properties and parameter space. We find that the properties of predator-predator-prey PET systems are fundamentally different from those of predator-prey-prey PFT systems. The likelihood of parameter combinations for which all PFTs stay extant for all time in predator-predator-prey PET systems depends critically on the process formulations used, and the properties of co-existing zooplankton (as defined by their parameter values) are quite different to those of co-existing phytoplankton.

Post-settlement survival bottlenecks, in part due to competitive benthic algae interactions should be addressed, to improve productivity for these initiatives. Sea urchins are keystone grazers in reef ecosystems, yet feeding behaviour of adults causes physical damage and mortality to developing coral spat. To investigate if microherbivory can be utilised for co-culture, we quantitatively assessed how varying densities of juvenile sea urchins Mespilia globulus (Linnaeus, 1758), reared alongside the coral Acropora millepora (Ehrenberg, 1834) effected survival and growth of coral recruits. Spawning of both species were induced ex situ. A comparison of A. millepora spat reared in three M. globulus densities (low 16.67 m(-2), medium 37.50 m(-2), high 75.00 m(-2)) and a non-grazed control indicated coral survival is significantly influenced by grazing activity (p < 0.001) and was highest in the highest density treatment (39.65 +/- 10.88%, mean +/- s.d). Urchin grazing also significantly (p < 0.001) influenced coral size (compared to non-grazing control), with colonies in the medium and high-densities growing the largest (21.13 +/- 1.02 mm & 20.80 +/- 0.82, mean +/- s.e.m). Increased urchin density did however have a negative influence on urchin growth, a result of limited food availability.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000484985500032	31506526

Variation in North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis occurrence in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, over three decades								ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH				39				159	171		10.3354/esr00951				2019	2019	North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (hereafter right whales) have recently shifted their distribution away from some protected feeding habitats, which suggests large-scale changes in food supply have occurred. Quantifying the nature and extent of the apparent shift is key to exploring this hypothesis and planning or revising conservation strategies. This paper characterizes decadal right whale occurrence in the Bay of Fundy summer feeding habitat using data derived from 7522 h of survey effort collected over 30 yr (1987 to 2016) that yielded 11483 right whale sightings. Eight occurrence descriptors were derived to quantify temporal variation in right whale presence, encounter rates and time of arrival in the Bay. Time of arrival was modeled using linear and power function models fit to annual discovery curves. Principal component analysis showed 2 modes that explained 58 and 14 % of the variation in occurrence, respectively. The first mode captured a significant decline in summertime right whale occurrence beginning in 2010. The second mode captured a decadal-scale cycle in seasonal timing of occurrence, which highlighted a sharp change from early to late occupancy at the turn of the millennium. Annual occurrence during the 2010-2016 period was anomalously low in both the Grand Manan Basin critical habitat and the Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Scheme (shipping lanes), whereas encounters in the region NW of the critical habitat containing Owen Basin and The Wolves islands may be increasing due to a distributional shift within the Bay. We discuss the consequences of these changes for both population dynamics and future conservation of the species.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1863-5407	1613-4796		WOS:000487122600013

As a proxy for heat tolerance we measured time to immobilization (T-imm) for 25 clonal lineages isolated from a single lake. The clonal lineages were grown on Chlamydomonas reinhardii at 15 degrees C. Upon deposition of the first clutch, T-imm and body fatty acids were determined. We report significant differences of T-imm and of the content of PUFAs and of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) among the D. magna clonal lineages. T-imm was negatively related to total PUFA-content, indicating that increased body PUFA-content may be detrimental for membrane properties at high temperatures. Juvenile somatic growth varied significantly among clonal lineages, and was not related to total body PUFA-content, hence body PUFA-content was no proxy for PUFA-limitation. No correlative evidence for an impact of body EPA-content on T-imm or juvenile growth was obtained. We hypothesize that the observed intra-population variability of body PUFA-content might be related to potentially different amplitudes in diel vertical migration in response to fish. These different amplitudes would mean differences in the extent of diurnal temperature fluctuations among the clonal lineages.					11th International Symposium on Cladocera11th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 24-29, 2017SEP 24-29, 2017		Kulmbach, GERMANYKulmbach, GERMANY	4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000504323100003

Prey capture by these spiders involves a foray from a cool subterranean retreat to the undersurface of a capture web that can be lethally hot. Striking, disentangling and retrieving prey from the capture web typically involves several short trips to the capture web, alternating with retreats to the cool burrow. It has been suggested that this behavior limits the increase of body temperature a spider must experience while working at the hot capture web. We used biophysical models ih conjunction with direct observations of prey-capture behavior and distributions of sand temperature to estimate body temperatures experienced by S. henscheli during prey capture. In the circumstances we observed, only the relatively long post-strike retreat from the capture web is important in keeping spiders' body temperatures from exceeding their lethal limits. After the post-strike retreat, shuttling appreciably limits the increase in body temperature of small individuals, but may have little effect on body temperature increase in larger spiders.									14	0	0	0	14	0	15			0340-5443			WOS:A1993LP94700004

USE - Method for culturing wheat fish broodstock. ADVANTAGE - The method enables culturing wheat fish broodstock with stimulated gonadal development, improved survival rate, and growth rate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A wheat fish broodstock culturing method, involves selecting 2 year old fish as broodstock without infirmity, intact scales and diseases, and with length more than 500 mm, and weight more than 2-3 g. The broodstock is sterilized by 3-5% salt water for 5-10 minutes. The broodstock is cultivated in breeding ponds for 1 month with area of 1-1.5 acres, depth 1-1.5 meters. The pond slope ratio is 1:2-3, set diagonally into outlet and fish passage facilities for anti-intrusion or fish to escape predators. The pond is planted with plants in the bottom to convert the flat bottom for suitable water retention. The pond is sterilized by 70-80 kg water disinfectant for 7-10 days, and then by 200-300 kg fermented organic fertilizer for 7-10 days. The broodstock is fed by 200-250 kg/acre homemade feed and live bait, where the feed is fed 2 times a day, morning and evening, amount of feed with respect to each fish is 1-1.5%. The fish is maintained under appropriate condition after 2 hours of feeding, where the fish is feed with live feed during winter, mainly from March. The pond is maintained by adjusting water temperature and water level to 20-30cm, where the water level is increased to maximum level during rainy season, followed by daily observing feeding, growth and activity of fish, changing the water every 10-15 days water, changing the water every 25-30% of the total pool water, spraying disinfectant for every 20-30 days, and regulating water quality, and water flow with microflow flush for every 4-6 days to stimulate gonadal development.															0						DIIDW:2014L12425		
J	Buckel, JA; Sharack, BL; Zdanowicz, VS								Effect of diet on otolith composition in Pomatomus saltatrix, an estuarine piscivore								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				64	6			1469	1484		10.1111/j.0022-1112.2004.00393.x				JUN 2004	2004	To test the hypothesis that elemental composition of otoliths (sagittae) could be influenced by differences in natural prey type, young-of-the-year bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix were captured immediately after their migration from oceanic waters into mid-Atlantic Bight estuaries and fed either shrimp, Crangon septemspinosa and Palaemonetes spp. or fish Menidia menidia under similar temperature and salinity regimes in two separate 60 day experiments. Unlimited rations of fish and shrimp prey were provided in the first experiment which led to differences in bluefish growth rate between the two prey treatments; fish prey was limited in the second experiment to ensure that growth rates of bluefish in the two prey treatments were similar. Concentrations of seven elements in bluefish otoliths were determined using solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). There was no significant effect of diet on five of the seven elements examined (Na, Mg, K, Ca and Mn). The levels of Sr and Ba in the otoliths of shrimp-fed bluefish, however, were significantly higher than fish-fed bluefish in both experiments. Concentrations of Ba in shrimp-fed bluefish otoliths were double that found in fish-fed bluefish. The results suggest that diet can explain some of the variation in otolith chemistry previously attributed to physical and chemical properties of the water.

J	Legaspi, JC								Life history of Podisus maculiventris (Heteroptera : Pentatomidae) adult females under different constant temperatures								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				33	5			1200	1206		10.1603/0046-225X-33.5.1200				OCT 2004	2004	Life table analysis was performed on Podisus maculiventris (Say) adult females at constant temperatures of 16, 26, 30, and 36degreesC. Survivorship curves were linear type 11, with steeper rates of decline at higher temperatures. Longevity at 16degreesC (47.2 d) was significantly longer than that at 26degreesC (14.3 d) or 30degreesC (12 d). Adults under the 36degreesC survived only 4.9 d and laid no eggs. Percentage of eggs that hatched was relatively constant at approximate to or about 40% at 16, 26, and 30degreesC. Numbers of egg clutches (ranging from 5.9 to 9.4), eggs per clutch (13.6-14.6), and eggs in the first clutch (9.0-15.1) did not differ significantly at these three temperatures. However, preoviposition period was significantly longer at 16degreesC (20.3 d) than at 26degreesC (6.3 d) and 30degreesC (4.9 d). Number of eggs laid was related to body weight by the equation E = -139.1 + 3.49w, where E is number of eggs laid per female lifetime, and w is the weight of the predator female. Life table analysis of P. maculiventris female adults showed that both net reproductive rate (R,,) and gross reproductive rate (GRR) were highest at 26degreesC, estimated at 47.8 and 156.0 females per female, respectively. However, the shorter generation times at 30degreesC (T = 42.2 d) resulted in higher values for the intrinsic rate of increase (r = 0.09), the finite rate of increase (lambda = 1.09), and doubling time (DT = 7.7 d). Analysis of cumulative egg production suggests that 26degreesC may be more suitable for maintaining colonies of P. maculiventris because of the sustained levels of egg production over a longer period, compared with the 30degreesC treatment.									13	0	0	0	18	0	18			0046-225X			WOS:000224606000011

We investigated the effects of fragment size and habitat edge on the relative functioning of three ecological processes - decomposition, predation and regeneration of trees - in small Afromontane forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ten sampling stations were placed in each of four forest categories: the interior of three large indigenous forest fragments (100 m from the edge), the edges of these large fragments, 10 small indigenous fragments (< 1 ha) and 10 small exotic woodlands (< 0.5 ha). Fragment size and edge effects did not affect the abundance of the amphipod Talitriator africana, a litter decomposer, and overall dung beetle abundance and species richness significantly. Bird egg predation was marginally greater at large patch edges compared with the other forest categories, while seed predation did not differ among forest categories. Tree seedling assemblage composition did not differ significantly among large patch interiors and edges, and small indigenous fragments. Sapling and canopy assemblage composition each differed significantly among these three indigenous forest categories. Thus, while tree recruitment was not negatively affected by patch size or distance from the edge, conditions in small fragments and at edges appear to affect the composition of advanced tree regeneration. These ecological processes in Afromontane forests appear to be resilient to fragmentation effects. We speculate that this is because the organisms in these forests have evolved under fragmented conditions. Repeated extreme changes in climate and vegetation over the Pleistocene have acted as significant distribution and ecological extinction filters on these southern hemisphere forest biota, resulting in fauna and flora that are potentially resilient to contemporary fragmentation effects. We argue that because small patches and habitat edges appear to be ecologically viable they should be included in future conservation decisions.									21	0	0	0	18	0	22			1442-9985	1442-9993		WOS:000245223800007

ANCOVA was used to assess differences in population growth rates, and an alternate method was developed to examine variations between annual length-at-age data and average 'expected' values over different age groupings. For larvae, the years 1986, 1981, 1989 and 1990 had higher than average length-at-age, and 1988 and 1991 had lower than average values. Relationships between growth and SST and larval density were not clear. A tentative relationship between copepod nauplii abundance and larval length-at-age was noted. The consequence of larval growth to larval mortality, late larval abundance or recruitment was not clear. We conclude that larval mortality rates are highly variable and tend to mask effects of moderate variability in growth on later abundance. For juveniles, 1987 had significantly lower than average length-at-age and 1988 had higher than average values. Although there are few years of data, they tend to support the importance of juvenile growth in the recruitment process. Conditions for the large 1988 year class are documented and discussed, including warm SST, calm winds, relatively low larval growth rates, low abundances of potential predators on larvae, low larval mortality rates, and high juvenile growth rates.									43	0	0	0	40	0	44			1054-6006			WOS:A1996TZ83300011		
J	Labropoulou, M; Machias, A								Effect of habitat selection on the dietary patterns of two triglid species								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				173				275	288		10.3354/meps173275				1998	1998	The distribution patterns and feeding habits of 2 triglids, Trigloporus lastoviza and Lepidotrigla cavillone, were investigated for fish collected in experimental trawl surveys carried out along the Cretan continental shelf over 4 yr. Despite their distribution overlap, depth and temperature selection differs considerably between species. T. lastoviza tended to select shallow depths and warm temperatures among those available, whereas L. cavillone was distributed throughout the exploited area and no significant temperature selection was found. Furthermore, no evidence of any size-depth relationship in either fish species was detected. Stomach content analysis revealed that both species were carnivores, feeding mainly on benthic invertebrates, and that each species consumed a narrow range of prey species with no significant dietary overlap. Classification and ordination of the gravimetric and numerical contributions of prey species in their diets demonstrated that the dietary samples of the 2 species were distinct. Interspecific dietary overlap was less than intraspecific overlap between size classes and between months. Trophic diversity was higher for T. lastoviza and increased significantly with fish size, while no effect of size on the low dietary breadth of L. cavillone was found. Species differences in preference and utilization of prey are related to their distribution patterns. In particular, T. lastoviza exhibited the most restricted distribution and appeared to have a broader trophic niche than L, cavillone, which occurs in a wider depth range. The results suggest that the ability of these species to exploit particular habitats and/or specific prey characteristics is an important feature of predator foraging that allows them to segregate their feeding niche at the depth range at which they co-occur.									23	0	0	0	22	1	23			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000077093600022

In contrast to most pugnose minnow populations across the global range, Canadian populations are primarily found in turbid systems, potentially indicating persistence in suboptimal conditions. We used data from a multi-gear species and habitat survey in the Canard River, Ontario, a system dominated by agricultural inputs and the best-known capture site of the species in Canada, to parameterise multi-gear occupancy models for understanding the relationship between pugnose minnow occupancy and microhabitat features, including the role of turbidity. Almost 300 pugnose minnow were captured, representing the largest single collection of the species in Canadian history. The best occupancy model indicated that the probability of pugnose minnow occupancy was highest in the deepest sites with the lowest water clarity (i.e. high turbidity); however, competing models suggested that occupancy was highest at sites with wild celery (Vallisneria americana) and higher water clarity, signifying that habitats with low turbidity may be utilised if sufficient physical cover exists. Together, our results suggest that Canadian pugnose minnow populations occupy and potentially favour turbid conditions, possibly to avoid visual predators in clearer habitats. It remains uncertain whether this abiotic association represents a long-term, viable, local adaptation or whether persistence of pugnose minnow in the Canard River is at risk unless significant water quality improvements can be made.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000496444500001

Mortality on fruit in citrus orchards caused by naturally occurring enemies of red scale Aonidiella aurantii: relation to spatial distribution of patch density and season								ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA				162	2			218	233		10.1111/eea.12525				FEB 2017	2017	The efficacy of biological control agents depends on the amount of mortality they impose on pests in the field. Quantifying their impact on a pest is critical for guiding decision-making in its management. Here, we quantify the relation of population levels of natural unmanipulated populations of a pest to mortality rates imposed by naturally occurring enemies. Mortality beyond first instar caused by natural enemies of Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) on fruit was studied in four unsprayed citrus orchards in a warm temperate coastal environment in New South Wales, Australia, over approximately three pest generations in the course of a year. The percentage of hosts on fruit suffering parasitism and predation was usually independent of host density. There was no consistent evidence that one parasitoid influenced another, nor that parasitism and predation rates were related. At the orchard scale, it was apparent that parasitism and predation over a time series were related to current or previous host numbers and could become high enough in relation to fecundity rates to cause pest numbers to decline. Temporal feedback to density could be causing the pest populations to fluctuate between limits at economically sustainable levels given additional mortality of the first instars due to expected rates of dispersal and subsequent pre- and post-settlement failures.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000394783300012

Although human activities regularly impose a disturbance on top predators, they can also be a source of reliable and concentrated food resources for species with a high degree of behavioral plasticity. This study represents the first assessment of the influence of these resources on migratory patterns and social interaction of a marine top predator, the common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. Pollock's closed robust design models and association analyses were applied to data collected over 9 consecutive years of research in a coastal area subject to significant use and pressure by humans. Photo-identification data were collected year-round during 955 boat-based surveys, resulting in 1638 common bottlenose dolphin group encounters. Results of this study revealed a significant upward trend in density of bottlenose dolphins, preferences for a coastal area with higher human pressure, and a reduction of the social interactions associated to a temporal switch to the food sources provided by human activities. The observed link between human activities and changes in common bottlenose dolphin behavior aim to contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of a marine top predator and provide some of the needed baseline data, from which effective management and conservation strategies can be designed.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000464932900003

In this paper, we estimated the condition factor, a measure of relative fitness based on the relationship of body weight to length, in four fish species representing two trophic levels (omnivores and piscivores) from Amazonian floodplain lakes for three consecutive years: 2004, 2005 (an anomalous drought year), and 2006. The two omnivores, Colossoma macropomum and Mylossoma duriventre, exhibited trends consistent with their life cycles in 2004 and 2006: high values during the hydrologic seasons of high water, receding water, and low water, with a drop following reproduction following the onset of rising water. However during the drought year of 2005 the condition factor was much lower than normal during receding and low water seasons, probably as a result of an abnormal reduction in resource availability in a reduced habitat. The two piscivorous piranhas, Serrasalmus spilopleura and S. elongatus, maintained relatively stable values of condition factor over the hydrologic cycles of all three years, with no apparent effect of the drought, probably because the reduction in habitat is counterbalanced by the resulting increase in relative prey density. We suggest that if predictions of increasing drought in the Amazon are correct, predatory species may benefit, at least in the short run, while omnivores may be negatively affected.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1519-6984	1678-4375		WOS:000431765400020	28832839

To understand its effect on phytoplankton community structure, a Eulerian fixed-point observation (FPO) was conducted on the Chukchi shelf in fall 2013. Temporal and vertical distributions of the phytoplankton community were inferred from algal pigment signatures. A strong wind event (SWE) occurred during the observation term, and significant convection supplied nutrients from the bottom layer to the surface. Before the SWE, pigment composition in the warmer, less saline, and nutrient-poor surface waters was diverse with low concentration of chlorophyll-a (chla). Vertical mixing induced by the SWE weakened the stratification and brought sufficient nutrients to enhance diatom-derived pigment concentrations (e.g., fucoxanthin and chlc3), suggesting increases in diatoms. We also developed a model to predict the distribution of major phytoplankton pigment/chla ratios using a profiling multi-wavelength fluorometer (Multi-Exciter) with higher spatio-temporal resolution. The Multi-Exciter also captured changes in pigment composition with environmental changes at the FPO site and at four observation sites 16 km from the location of the FPO. Furthermore, we investigated the change in grazing rates of the major Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis copepodid stage five to assess the interaction between primary and secondary producers during the fall bloom. Increased diatom biomass caused a significant increase in the grazing rate on microphytoplankton (> 20 A mu m) and a decrease on nanophytoplankton (2-20 A mu m), indicative of a strong cascade effect because of the reduction of microzooplankton due to the grazing from C. glacialis. We conclude that SWEs during fall might affect food webs via the alternation of seasonal succession of phytoplankton community structure.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000434253800018

Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus rely mostly on stored energy reserves for reproduction. They feed almost exclusively on krill, which vary in density and abundance both spatially and temporally. We used 10 depth-velocity archival tags deployed on blue whales foraging in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, to identify feeding events. We modeled krill densities required to equal or exceed energy expenditures and allow energy storage. During the daytime, blue whales generally dove deeper and performed fewer but longer feeding dives than at other times of the diel cycle (10 vs. 28 feeding dives h(-1)); however, they performed more lunges per dive during daytime (3 vs. 1 lunge dive(-1)), which resulted in a stable feeding rate around the clock. Only 11.7 and 5.5 % of the Arctic and northern krill patches measured in situ contained densities allowing blue whales to achieve neutral energetic balance (FE = 1); less than 1.5 % of patches allowed FE of >= 3. While FE leading to successful reproduction and adequate fitness is unknown, these results underscore the necessity for blue whales to seek the highest densities within patches to reach neutral balance or allow energy storage. These findings further our understanding of blue whale foraging ecology and habitat suitability, and may help predict the effects of climate and natural variability or of potential fisheries on krill densities and blue whale condition.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000485738600013

Growth rates varied considerably among populations, but juvenile growth rates and adult body sizes were generally among the lowest in Europe. Mean age at maturity ranged from 2.0 to 3.9, and was strongly predicted by the juvenile growth rate (earlier maturity with faster juvenile growth). Other population parameters that also displayed significant negative associations with mean age at maturity were gonadosomatic index, body condition, and adult body size (total length, TL at age 5). Mean TL at maturity and the adult growth increment showed no significant associations with any of the other growth or life-history variables. Pumpkinseed populations in England matured significantly later than those introduced into warmer, more southerly areas of the continental Europe. All of these data suggest that a combination of cool summer temperatures and resource limitation is the cause of slow growth, small adult body size and delayed maturity relative to introduced populations on the European mainland.					11th European Congress of Ichthyology11th European Congress of Ichthyology	SEP 06-10, 2004SEP 06-10, 2004		Tallinn, ESTONIATallinn, ESTONIA	46	0	0	0	43	0	48			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000231508000004

Because Pomoxis spp. larvae are among the smallest freshwater larvae and competition with gizzard shad larvae (Dorosoma cepedianum) is likely, we hypothesized that first-feeding Pomoxis spp. larvae would be susceptible to slow growth and starvation. We estimated survival by comparing proportional weekly cohort distributions of Pomoxis spp. larvae and juveniles. When distributions differed, a cohort survival index was evaluated against density of appropriately sized zooplankton biomass (crustaceans and rotifers), as well as temperature, turbidity, and density of all limnetic larvae that occurred during hatch week, when exogenous feeding began. Growth of first-feeding larvae (<10 days old) increased with total zooplankton biomass (r(2) = 0.64); growth of larvae aged 10-16 days was unrelated to all measured variables. Survival was positively correlated with zooplankton biomass in only one of four reservoirs, and other variables did not correlate as expected. This result casts doubt on whether zooplankton contributes to survival of freshwater larvae.									29	0	0	0	29	0	30			0706-652X			WOS:000187754000002		
J	Pardo, Adara; Pulido, Fernando					Pulido, Fernando/0000-0001-5620-1918			Upscaling hypotheses on herbivore damage in plants facing environmental stress: Variation among scales and plant enemies in a relict tree								BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY				21				34	44		10.1016/j.baae.2017.07.002				JUN 2017	2017	The few existing analyses of broad-scale variation in plantherbivore interactions are largely exploratory and not based on hypotheses on the effect of varying environmental conditions on the patterns of herbivore damage. However, there are two established hypotheses that relate herbivore damage and environmental stress mostly tested at the within-population level: the Plant Stress Hypothesis (PSH) and the Plant Vigor Hypothesis (PVH). To examine if support for the PSH holds true at broader scales, we tested it at the micro- (among individuals), meso- (between habitats) and macroscale (between geographical regions, Iberia and Macaronesia). We measured plant stress and leaf damage by different natural enemies (chewers, miners and pathogens) in 12 populations across the range of the relict tree Prunus lusitanica. Results regarding the proportion of leaves attacked by any enemy showed no support for the PSH at either micro or mesoscale, observing instead higher damage in less stressed individuals within populations and in high-quality habitats. However, the latter was true exclusively within the Macaronesian region, highlighting the important effect of the type of abiotic stress on plant susceptibility to herbivory. At the macroscale, alternatively, results showed support for the PSH: we observed a higher proportion of leaves attacked in Macaronesia than in Iberia, where plants unexpectedly exhibited greater stress symptoms. Among-scale inconsistencies may respond to the effect of distinct climatic factors governing both plant and herbivore dynamics at large scales, particularly in species with distributional ranges across contrasting climatic regions such as P. lusitanica. Finally, different plant enemies showed different patterns of damage, corroborating the need to study them separately to achieve consistent generalizations of these hypotheses.

This is problematic as freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened systems on earth. Nonetheless, terrestrial protected areas (TPAs) may afford spill-over benefits to freshwater ecosystems included within their boundaries, but evaluations of these potential benefits for the protection of freshwater fish diversity are lacking. Using fish community data from 175 lakes inside, outside, or bordering TPAs in Ontario, Canada, we sought to determine if TPAs preserve fish functional diversity. We focused on functional diversity because previous work indicated no taxonomic differences between these lakes, but a difference in normalised-length size-spectra slopes inside versus outside TPAs (indicator of unique predator-prey ratios and trophic energy transfer). We expected that communities inside TPAs would show greater functional diversity (i.e. functional dispersion and functional richness) and have more extreme trait combinations (i.e. functional divergence) than communities outside or bordering TPAs. We also tested for differences in the rarity of species-specific functional traits between fish communities inside, outside, or bordering TPAs, between thermal guilds, and across average body size and overall prevalence of the species. Our results indicated no significant differences in functional diversity among lake fish communities inside, outside, or bordering TPAs. However, fish communities inside TPAs had more extreme trait combinations than outside TPAs because abundant species in lake communities outside TPAs had more ubiquitous trait combinations than abundant fishes inside TPAs. Small-bodied species showed greater functional rarity than large-bodied species, indicating that small-bodied fishes fill functionally unique roles while the most prevalent, large-bodied species possess a more generalist set of traits. Overall, the similarity of functional diversity metrics for lake fish communities inside, outside, or bordering TPAs in Ontario suggests that TPAs capture the functional diversity of Ontario's lake fish communities. However, we encourage similar evaluations in regions where environmental conditions and stressors are more distinct across TPA boundaries than they are in Ontario, as these types of evaluations will inform guidelines for the design of freshwater protected areas and monitoring of their effectiveness in the future.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000486105400001		
J	LANTRY, BF; STEWART, DJ								ECOLOGICAL ENERGETICS OF RAINBOW SMELT IN THE LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES - AN INTERLAKE COMPARISON								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				122	5			951	976		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0951:EEORSI>2.3.CO;2				SEP 1993	1993	We developed an energetics model for rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax to quantify its role as a producer and a predator in Great Lakes ecosystems. We measured the weight (W, g) and temperature (T, degrees-C) dependences of routine metabolism: R (cal . g-1 . h-1) = 0.3646 . W-0.216. e0.036 T. We evaluated seasonal and ontogenetic patterns of rainbow smelt energy density. Seasonal and size-dependent diet composition was estimated based on an extensive analysis of smelt diets in Lakes Michigan and Ontario and a synthesis of published diet data for all of the Great Lakes. For each lake, we employed lake-specific temperature regimes, growth rates, mortality rates, and abundance estimates. Model simulations for the average individual rainbow smelt in the various lakes revealed gross food conversion efficiencies (GCE) of 13.8-15.8% averaged over all age-classes. For the youngest age-class, GCE was usually close to 20% and two or three times greater than for age-classes 4 and 5. An empirical estimate of daily ration in Lake Michigan in late August was between 0.017 and 0.037 g food/g smelt, depending on the value assumed for stomach evacuation rate. Our model predicted a ration of about 0.022 g . g-1 for that same period. Total annual rainbow smelt production and predation were about 100 times greater in Lake Erie than in Lake Superior. Biomass-specific consumption (C:B) ratios per age-class in Lake Michigan were highest for rainbow smelt of ages 0 and 1 (14.64 and 9.00) and lowest for ages 4 and 5 (4.60 and 4.54). Production was concentrated in the first three age-classes in all the lakes and ages 0 and 1 accounted for about 87% of the total production in Lake Erie. Population GCE was highest in Lake Erie (20.4%) and lowest in Lake Ontario (15.6%). Production: biomass (P:B) ratios varied from 1.54 in Lake Erie to 1.10 in Lake Ontario. The highest P:B ratio for any age-class was 2.97 for age-0 rainbow smelt in Lake Erie and the lowest was 0.29 for age-4 fish in Lake Huron. Simulations indicated that rainbow smelt biomass is concentrated in age-classes that may be thermally segregated from salmonine predators and that increased mortality of older smelt age-classes can reduce predation by smelt on other fishes.									109	0	0	0	104	0	110			0002-8487			WOS:A1993MJ44000025

Subsequently. these models were calibrated and fitted using available catch, fishing effort/mortality, and abundance data series and incorporated environmental and internal drivers. This study furthers the previous comparative analyses by comparing changes in ecosystem structure using a selection of ecosystem indicators from the calibrated models and assessing how these indicators change over time in these three contrasting ecosystems. Indicators examined include community turnover rates (production/biomass), trophic level of landings and the community, biodiversity indicators, ratios of predatory/forage fish and pelagic/demersal fish biomass, catch ratios, and network analysis indicators. Using the set of model-derived indicators, the three ecosystems were ranked in terms of exploitation level. This ranking was performed using the values of these indicators in recent years (ecosystem state) as well as their trends over time (ecosystem trend). The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Median tests were used to test for significance of the difference between indicators from the three ecosystems in the last 5 years of the Simulation to compare present ecosystem states. We compared the slope of the lineal trend and its significance between ecosystems using the generalized least-squares regression taking auto-correlation into consideration to analyse ecosystem trends. The indicators that capture better the high impacts of fishing prevalent in the Mediterranean and Humboldt ecosystems, and the more conservative exploitation of the Southern Benguela, are the fish/invertebrates biomass and catch ratio, the demersal/pelagic fish biomass and catch ratio (depending on the ecosystem and the fishery being developed), flows to detritus, and the mean trophic level of the community (when large, poorly quantified groups such as zooplankton and detritus are excluded). This study suggests that the best option for classifying ecosystems according to the impact of fishing is to consider a broad range of indicators to understand how and why an ecosystem is responding to particular environmental or fishing drivers (or more likely a combination of these). Our results highlight the importance of including indicators capturing trends over time as well as recent ecosystem states. We also identified 23 pairs of indicators that correlated similarly in the three ecosystems (they showed a significant correlation with same sign). Further comparisons may contribute towards generalization of this list, progressing towards a better understanding of the behaviour of ecological indicators. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Capturing the pattern of variability within a system (enough to declare a significant change from past to present) relies on correct assumptions about the temporal scale of the processes involved. Sufficient long-term data are often lacking, and current techniques have their weaknesses. To address this concern, we constructed multistate and artificial neural network models (ANN) to provide fore- and hindcast vegetation communities considered critical foraging habitat for an endangered bird, the Florida Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis). Multistate models were not able to hindcast due to our data not satisfying a detailed balance requirement for time reversibility in Markovian dynamics. Multistate models were useful for forecasting and providing environmental variables for the ANN. Results from our ANN hindcast closely mirrored the population collapse of the Snail Kite population using only environmental data to inform the model. The parallel between the two gives us confidence in the hindcasting results and their use in future demographic models.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000329836900017	24640544

FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				7						114	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00114				FEB 11 2016	2016	Recent studies reported comparatively lower heterotrophic bacteria (HB) abundances in tropical regions, indicating that factors involved in bacterial losses could be more relevant in the tropics. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) are considered the main predators of HB in aquatic ecosystems, and one should expect higher abundances in the tropics because of differences in the food web configuration (absence of large daphnids). However, there are no comprehensive studies comparing HB and HNF abundances in a latitudinal gradient. We hypothesized that HB abundance would be lower in the tropics because HNF abundance would be higher, resulting in a tighter HNF-HB coupling. To test this hypothesis, we compiled a large dataset of HB and HNF abundances from tropical and temperate freshwater environments. We found that both HB and HNF abundances were lower in the tropical region, and that HNF-HB coupling does not differ between temperate and tropical regions. The lower HNF abundance and lack of coupling may be explained by a strong top-down control on HNF and/or their herbivory preference. Besides, no relationship was found between bacterial specific growth rate and either chlorophyll-a and HB abundance, indicating that bacterial losses may have an important role in tropical freshwaters. Thus, we found that HNF is likely not the main controllers of HB abundance, and that grazing by ciliates and cladocerans, together with the physiological effects of higher temperatures, may explain the high bacterial loss rates in the tropics.									10	0	1	0	9	0	11			1664-302X			WOS:000443417500001	26903993

Additionally, jellyfish stings can cause severe pain, inflammation of the affected skin, and allergic reactions in human. Climate and environmental changes are likely to affect the medusae, but it is not yet clear whether these will affect their distribution, physiology, and their toxicity. Very little is known about the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on the proliferation and the distribution of medusan nematocysts. In this study, we compared three types of nematocysts (euryteles and A- and O-isorhizas) and venoms of Cyanea capillata medusae (Scyphozoa) obtained from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, which have different salinity and temperature ranges. Different types of nematocysts were separated by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting (LMPC), and the proteinaceous contents of the nematocysts were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Medusae from the brackish Baltic Sea possessed more euryteles than those from the North Sea. The O-isorhizas and A-isorhizas were smaller in the Baltic Sea sample compared to the North Sea samples and the length-to-width ratios were larger in the Baltic Sea sample. Moreover, the pattern of proteins (potential toxins) obtained from the separated nematocysts showed differences among samples and nematocyst types, but no clear pattern was observable. This study displays the novel LMPC/MALDI-TOF MS approach as a useful tool to investigate the function and venom of cnidarian nematocysts types.									12	0	0	0	9	1	12			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000276659700016

In this trial, the efficacy of this fungus against the larvae of the three major nematode species of goats was compared in various conditions of coproculture. Twelve strongyle free goats were experimentally infected with either Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Teladorsagia circumcincta or Haemonchus contortus larvae. Half of the animals received an oral dose of 5 x 10(5) Duddingtonia chlamydo-spores/ kg/BW daily for 27 days, whereas the remaining was kept as control goats. From the 7th day of administration onwards, individual coproscopical examinations as well as coprocultures, which were incubated 4, 7, 10 or 14 days at 21 or 28 C, were performed. The reduction in developing larvae due to the activity of Duddingtonia ranged from 62.8 to 99.5% compared to control. The trapping efficacy depended on temperature (better activity of the fungus at 21 than at 28 degrees C) and on duration (larval reductions lower after 4 days than after 7, 10 and 14 days of coproculture). Teladorsagia larvae were the least trapped, and Haemonchus larvae were the most trapped.									13	1	0	0	8	1	14			0932-0113	1432-1955		WOS:000235113200006	16328368

Sharing information among data types based on the underlying ecological, and recognizing observation biases, can improve estimation of individual and global parameters. We present a general integrated population model (IPM), specifically designed for brown bears (Ursus arctos), using three common data types for bear (U. spp.) populations: repeated counts, capture-mark-recapture, and litter size. We considered factors affecting ecological and observation processes for these data. We assessed the practicality of this approach on a simulated population and compared estimates from our model to values used for simulation and results from count data only. We then present a practical application of this general approach adapted to the constraints of a case study using historical data available for brown bears on Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA. The IPM provided more accurate and precise estimates than models accounting for repeated count data only, with credible intervals including the true population 94% and 5% of the time, respectively. For the Kodiak population, we estimated annual average litter size (within one year after birth) to vary between 0.45 [95% credible interval: 0.43; 0.55] and 1.59 [1.55; 1.82]. We detected a positive relationship between salmon availability and adult survival, with survival probabilities greater for females than males. Survival probabilities increased from cubs to yearlings to dependent young 2years old and decreased with litter size. Linking multiple information sources based on ecological and observation mechanisms can provide more accurate and precise estimates, to better inform management. IPMs can also reduce data collection efforts by sharing information among agencies and management units. Our approach responds to an increasing need in bear populations' management and can be readily adapted to other large carnivores.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			2045-7758			WOS:000415900800027	29187987

Movement of Perillus bioculatus (F.), a predator of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Sa)), was studied under both laboratory and field conditions. Factors studied were temperature, number of P. bioculatus nymphs released, their nymphal stage, and physiological age affecting satiety level. As temperature exceeded 19 degrees C under a sine wave fluctuating temperature regime in the laboratory, dispersal of 2nd and 4th instars strongly increased. Nymphs of the 4th instar were more mobile and dispersive than those of the 2nd instar. Nymphs of both stages departed from a release point on potato foliage in approximately half the time when released singly than in groups. Fourth instars showed a reduced tendency to aggregate compared with 2nd instars, resulting in 3 times earlier dispersal. Variation of physiological age within the Ind and 4th nymphal stages for nymphs with unlimited access to prey showed that older (and more satiated) individuals were less mobile than younger (and hungrier) ones. Physiologically more advanced nymphs within an instar formed larger and more stable groups than less mature ones, as they presumably were assimilating food and preparing for molting. Field tests with 2nd instars confirmed conclusions reached in the laboratory with respect to the effects of temperature, grouping, and physiological age on dispersal.									9	0	0	0	8	0	10			0046-225X			WOS:A1997XU11900028

Yet systematically and clearly addressing these factors, and hence implementing EAFM, has suffered from a lack of clear operational guidance. Here, we propose 13 main factors (shift in location, migration route or timing, overfishing (three types), decrease in physiology, increase in predation, increase in competition, decrease in prey availability, increase in disease or parasites and a decline in habitat quality or habitat quantity) that can negatively influence fish populations via mechanisms readily observable in similar to 20 population features. Using these features as part of a diagnostic framework, we develop flow charts that link probable mechanism(s) underlying population change to the most judicious management actions. We then apply the framework for example case studies that have well-known and documented population dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide a clearly defined matrix of all the probable responses to the most common factors influencing fish populations, and to examine possible diagnostics simultaneously, comparatively and relatively in an attempt to elucidate the most probable mechanisms responsible. The framework we propose aims to operationalize EAFM, thereby not only better diagnosing factors influencing fish populations, but also suggesting the most appropriate management interventions, and ultimately leading to improved fisheries. We assert the framework proposed should result in both better use of limited analytical and observational resources and more tailored and effective management actions.									3	0	0	0	2	0	4			1467-2960	1467-2979		WOS:000519224100011

Spatial DYMEX allows modellers to develop process-based population dynamics simulations that include spatially-explicit dispersal. Traditionally, models of species dynamics have focused on either population demographics or dispersal processes. Where trade-offs in model detail between processes describing population dynamics and dispersal have frequently been required, Spatial DYMEX utilises a computationally-efficient cohort-based approach that allows the model to capture both temporal and spatial population variability. The computational efficiency results from the professionally developed underlying code structure and re-usable modules that allow the modeller to rapidly develop models without knowledge of computer code. Cohorts are a single entity that is used to represent a well-defined group of individuals who share the same or similar characteristics (e. g. of the same age and sex) who are studied over a period of time. They are commonly used in ecological modelling.DYMEX includes a graphical user interface that employs conceptual modules that are familiar to ecologists (e. g. lifecycles) and combines them with a library of customisable mathematical functions (e. g. logistic). Multiple lifecycles can be included in a model, and they can be linked to simulate a variety of ecological interactions (e. g. predation or competition). Deme structures can be used to include the effects of genetic diversity, for exploring topics such as pesticide resistance. Spatial DYMEX includes a range of graphical and spatial visualisation tools to analyse model outputs.This novel modelling software allows the modeller to capture simultaneously the dynamics of spread with a consideration of the ecological, environmental and behavioural factors that precede a migration or dispersal event and the consequences of dispersal. We demonstrate the capabilities of the enhanced Spatial DYMEX package using a case study of the population dynamics and dispersal of an aphid-virus-wheat system. The mechanistic, cohort-based approach offered by DYMEX allows us to simulate how various environmental drivers may impact upon processes that drive wheat growth and aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) population dynamics, allowing us to estimate potential outcomes under future climate scenarios. A driving question for this research is whether Yellow Dwarf Virus, which is spread by aphids, will become a greater threat to wheat yields under climate change. The spatial modelling capabilities of the latest DYMEX now allow us to examine the spatial implications, where shifts in the timing of migration events at the start of the season may alter the timing of arrival and subsequent population dynamics of the aphids and virus in the wheat crop.					19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011DEC 12-16, 2011	CSIRO; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr; Perth Convent Bur; Curtin Univ; Australian Math Soc (Aust MS); Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM); Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI); Maralte Publishers; Econ Soc Australian (ESA); HEMA Consulting; Simulat Australia; Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI); Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ); Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)CSIRO; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr; Perth Convent Bur; Curtin Univ; Australian Math Soc (Aust MS); Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM); Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI); Maralte Publishers; Econ Soc Australian (ESA); HEMA Consulting; Simulat Australia; Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI); Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ); Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)	Perth, AUSTRALIAPerth, AUSTRALIA	3	1	0	0	2	0	4					978-0-9872143-1-7	WOS:000314989302075

Corophiutn orientale showed a semiannual life cycle. In the southern part, breeding occurred from early spring to mid autumn having three peaks, in early spring, early summer and early autumn, and three cohorts were produced, a spring cohort, a summer cohort and an overwintering one. In the shallower innermost northern part of Monolimm lagoon, breeding peaked in mid-spring and, also, in early autumn, and two discrete cohorts, a spring and an overwintering one, were produced. A lack of large individuals, attributed to a temporary size - selective predation by migrating shorebirds, was observed during summer. That lack possibly contributed to the hiatus in reproduction. Photoperiod seemed to be a more important cue than temperature in the initiation of the reproductive cycle, while extremely low salinities (< 1 psu) did not deter breeding. Females attained maturity at a smaller size in late spring and, especially, in summer than in early spring at lower temperatures. Brood size was a function of females' body size. Females, matured during summer at high temperatures, showed the lowest brood size, body length ratio. Mean brood size was small (12-13 early embryos) and embryo loss during development high (54%), possibly due to a negative effect of low salinities. A 1:1 sex ratio existed in the small body length classes, but females preponderated in the large ones. The spring cohort in the southern part, which developed at moderate temperatures, showed the highest growth rate (40 mu m day(-1)). Secondary production of C. orientale calculated by Hynes's method gave a mean annual density of 4562.5 and 9327.6 ind. m(-2), a mean annual crop (B) of 1.03 and 2.67 g DW m(-2), an annual production (P) of 6.91 and 22.54 g DW m(-2) and a P/B ratio of 6.7 and 8.4 in the northern and southern part of the lagoon, respectively.									24	2	0	0	18	4	26			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000230589900007

Dethier, Megan/0000-0001-8900-0522			Decoupling of recruitment from adult clam assemblages along an estuarine shoreline								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				422				48	54		10.1016/j.jembe.2012.04.009				JUL 1 2012	2012	The maintenance of populations of benthic species requires both effective (if not regular) recruitment plus sufficient post-recruitment survival through vulnerable juvenile phases. Decoupling of abundances of settlers and adults often occurs when conditions for juvenile survival are poor. For infaunal bivalves, predation can be a key process that alters the abundance or distribution of adults relative to early recruits. We examined spatial patterns of recruitment of intertidal clams along the marine-estuarine axis in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Abundances and species richness of clam recruits were variable in space and time, but during the period of high recruitment (summer) were equal across all sites. Juvenile and adult clams, however, were consistently rare at the inner-estuarine sites relative to the outer. We hypothesized that predation was higher at our inner sites, and manipulated predator access to newly recruited clam assemblages along the estuarine gradient. Predators >1 cm were excluded with mesh net from intertidal PVC tubes where recruitment of clams was allowed to occur naturally, and abundances and species richness of clams were measured after one summer season. Tubes with mesh nets over the top had significantly higher overall abundances of clams than unprotected tubes after 4 months, but showed no difference in clam species richness. More strikingly, the clam assemblage at the inner-estuarine sites comprised very few individuals relative to the outer-estuarine sites, regardless of predator exclusion. Multivariate analyses showed that clam assemblages in the tubes were better explained by position along the estuarine gradient than by predator treatment. Parallel studies at these sites suggested that growth of suspension feeders is actually higher in the inner estuary. Physical gradients are much less extreme in this well-mixed fjord than in many other estuaries, but we hypothesize that physical stresses such as higher temperatures at the inner beaches in the summer may be a major contributor to juvenile mortality, decoupling recruitment from adult populations.

Major findings are summarized and their limitations outlined. Current research, with recent reestablishment and expansion of many sampling programmes, is presented, and possible future approaches are indicated. These unique long-term data sets provide an environmental baseline,for predicting complex ecological responses to local, regional, and global environmental change.Between 1888 and the present, investigations have been carried out into the physical, chemical, and biological components (ranging from plankton and fish to benthic and intertidal assemblages) of the western English Channel ecosystem. The Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom has performed the main body of these observations. More recent contributions come from the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, now the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, dating from 1957; the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, from 1974 to 1987; and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which was formed by amalgamation of the Institute for Marine Environmental Research and part of the Marine Biological Association,,from 1988. Together, these contributions constitute a unique data series-one of the longest and most comprehensive samplings of enviromnental and marine biological variables in the world. Since the termination of many of these time series in 1987-1988 during a reorganisation of UK marine research, there has been a resurgence of interest in long-term environmental change. Many programmes have been restarted and expanded with support from several agencies.The observations span significant periods of warming (1921-1961; 1985-present) and cooling (1962-1980). During these periods of change, the abundance of key species underwent dramatic shifts. The first period of warming saw changes in zooplankton, pelagic fish, and larval fish, including the collapse of an important herring fishery. During later periods of change, shifts in species abundances have been reflected in other assemblages, such as the intertidal zone and the benthic fauna.Many of these changes appear to be related to climate, manifested as temperature changes, acting directly or indirectly. The hypothesis that climate is a forcing factor is widely supported today and has been reinforced by recent studies that show, responses of marine organisms to climatic attributes such as the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.The long-term data also yield important insights into the effects of anthropogenic disturbances such as fisheries exploitation and pollution. Comparison of demersal fish hauls over time highlights fisheries effects not only on commercially important species but also on the entire demersal community. The effects of acute ("Torrey Canyon" oil spill) and chronic (tributyltin [TBT] antifoulants) pollution are clearly seen in the intertidal records.Significant advances in diverse scientific disciplines have been generated from research undertaken alongside the long-term data series. Many concepts in marine biological textbooks have originated in part from this work (e.g. the seasonal cycle of plankton, the cycling of nutrients, the pelagic food web trophic interactions, and the influence of hydrography on pelagic communities). Associated projects currently range.from studies of marine viruses and bacterial ecology to zooplankton feeding dynamics and validation of ocean colour satellite sensors.Recent advances in technology mean these long-term programmes are more valuable than ever before. New technology collects data on finer temporal and spatial scales and can be used to capture processes that operate on multiple scales and hell) determine their influence in the marine environment. The MBA has been in the forefront of environmental modelling of sheaf seas since the early 1970s. Future directions being pursued include the continued development of coupled physical-ecosystem models using western English Channel time-series data. These models will include both the recent high-resolution data and the long-term time-series information to predict effects of future climate change scenarios. It, would be beneficial to provide more spatial and high-resolution temporal context to these data, which are fundamental for capturing processes that operate at multiple scales and understanding hoiv they operate within the marine environment. This is being achieved through employment of technologies such as sateillite-derived information and advanced telemetry instruments that pro vide real-time in situ profile data from the water column.									235	0	0	0	176	0	237			0065-2881		0-12-026148-0	WOS:000228071400001	15596166

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of prey availability and temperature variation on the diet of three anuran species (Boana pulchella, Odontophrynus maisuma, and Leptodactylus latrans) in subtropical swamps. Coleoptera, Araneae, Diptera, and Hymenoptera were the most important prey. Trophic niche overlap was greatest between Odontophrynus maisuma and B. pulchella. In the warmer months, all three species narrowed their trophic niches by increasing the consumption of certain prey. The changes recorded in the diet might be related to variations in prey availability and other aspects of feeding ecology, such as adaptations in foraging activity, and show that these species have some plasticity regarding their feeding habits.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1808-9798			WOS:000505163900005

Percid fish such as yellow perch, European perch, or pikeperch are more and more often an object of rearing in pond aquaculture and recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). This is particularly important because aquaculture is constantly developing in the world and meets the limited possibilities of using natural resources for fishmeal production. Moreover, fishing for the production of fishmeal adversely affects the natural environment, including the conservation status of predatory fish species which play a key role in maintaining the balance of the aquatic environment. The study showed that the use of feed formulated on wheat gluten is beneficial in yellow perch feeding. Furthermore, feed containing wheat gluten compared to commercial feed based on fish meal showed no significant differences in the growth rate and survival of fish. This is important as a consequence of the implementation of sustainable and nature-friendly aquaculture through the protection of natural resources such as protection of schools of fish being the source of fishmeal. Moreover, over the past 40 years, the price of fishmeal increased significantly and as other products used to produce fish feed are subject to fluctuations. This is caused by many factors, including increased demand, reduction of natural resources, or climate change. Currently, the prices of wheat gluten and fishmeal are at a comparable level. Therefore, it seems that a balanced development of the aquaculture sector will be associated with the protection of natural fish stocks and, therefore, with greater use of agriculture products in animal nutrition.Abstract Nutrition affects the metabolism of muscle cells and myogenic progenitor cells which play a crucial role in the growth and development of the muscle tissue. Because of the fact that the development process of yellow perch muscle tissue is not well known, the study aimed to analyze the influence of diets containing wheat gluten and supplemented with Lys and Gly in dipeptides or free form. Fish were allocated into 12 tanks and divided into four groups. Two of the experimental diets were supplemented Lys-Gly in the dipeptide form (DP group) or free amino acids (FAA group). The third was not supplemented with lysine (LF group). The fourth group of fish was fed commercial starter Bio-Oregon (C group). Histological or histomorphometric analyses were conducted: white muscle area, the total number of muscle fibers, the total number of white muscle nuclei, muscle fiber area, number of proliferating myonuclei. Fish fed LF diet showed the lowest number of nuclei and satellite cells proliferation. Results in DP and FAA groups were similar to that observed in fish fed C diet. Summarizing, wheat gluten-based diets supplemented with Lys-Gly dipeptide or free Lys and Gly amino acids exert beneficial effects on the morphology of yellow perch white muscle.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2076-2615			WOS:000529378800021	32120964

Morphologically, Cottesmore pumpkinseed appear to have a more streamlined body than the two southerly populations for which data are available, but this may be due to the small body size of the Cottesmore population. Ontogenetically, 11 morphological characters grew isometrically, 12 allometrically, and 3 split-isometrically (i.e. a significant shift in proportional growth rate); however, the split 'break points' (between 49 and 60 mm SL) do not appear to correspond with any change in resource use or in biological process. Juvenile and age-specific growth were the lowest reported of any European population, and mean GSI was also low. Growth rate was highest in May and June, with condition highest in June, and with peak GSI in June and July. Mean age at maturity in the Cottesmore population was the highest reported in Europe. Dietary overlap was high amongst most age classes, and there was evidence of cannibalism in the population. Late maturity of the Cottesmore population was probably the result of relatively low temperatures during the growing season, slow growth, poor condition at age 3 (due to limited food resources), and intensive egg predation by high numbers of juveniles, giving a fitness advantage to late-maturing females.									57	1	0	0	54	2	63			0003-9136			WOS:000179937500005

Understanding variability in recruitment can reveal mechanisms behind widespread decline in the abundance of key species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. For fish populations, the match-mismatch theory hypothesizes that successful recruitment is a function of the timing and duration of larval fish abundance and prey availability. However, the underlying mechanisms of match-mismatch dynamics and the factors driving spatial differences between high and low recruitment remain poorly understood.Methodology/Principal Findings: We used empirical observations of larval fish abundance, a mechanistic individual-based model, and a reanalysis of ocean temperature data from 1960 to 2002 to estimate the survival of larval cod (Gadus morhua). From the model, we quantified how survival rates changed during the warmest and coldest years at four important cod spawning sites in the North Atlantic. The modeled difference in survival probability was not large for any given month between cold or warm years. However, the cumulative effect of higher growth rates and survival through the entire spawning season in warm years was substantial with 308%, 385%, 154%, and 175% increases in survival for Georges Bank, Iceland, North Sea, and Lofoten cod stocks, respectively. We also found that the importance of match-mismatch dynamics generally increased with latitude.Conclusions/Significance: Our analyses indicate that a key factor for enhancing survival is the duration of the overlap between larval and prey abundance and not the actual timing of the peak abundance. During warm years, the duration of the overlap between larval fish and their prey is prolonged due to an early onset of the spring bloom. This prolonged season enhances cumulative growth and survival, leading to a greater number of large individuals with enhanced potential for survival to recruitment.									94	0	0	0	78	0	94			1932-6203			WOS:000288099800012	21408215

While spillover of organisms from perennial habitats into agricultural fields received some attention in the context of ecosystem service provisioning, the spillover into semi-natural habitats has rarely been addressed, although spillover of generalist predators or competition for pollinators can have consequences for nature conservation. We studied predation rates of ground-dwelling predators on 20 calcareous grasslands, with either coniferous forest or a crop field as adjacent habitat. As prey items we exposed 32,000 ladybird eggs on the grasslands. Within two study periods (June to September) predation rates were higher at warm compared to cool days, but did not depend on the study period itself or the distance from the edge where prey items were placed. In each study period we found higher predation rates when coniferous forest was the adjacent habitat, however, only on cool days. On warm days, prey items were consumed to very high extents (often 100%), which did not allow the detection of possible differences between adjacent habitat types. The higher predation rates on grasslands adjacent to forests can be explained by predator spillover from forests to grasslands. We conclude that semi-natural habitats provide not only ecosystem services in adjacent human dominated habitats, but are also exposed to antagonistic spillover effects. Such antagonistic spillover should be considered in conservation strategies for semi-natural habitats.									18	1	0	0	18	0	19			1439-1791	1618-0089		WOS:000325758400010

In the tropical lowland lakes of Brazil, calanoid copepods of the Notodiaptomus complex dominate zooplankton and co-exist in high abundance with permanent blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, raising questions for grazer effects on bloom dynamics (i.e., top-down control vs. facilitation of cyanobacterial dominance). Accordingly, the effect of copepod grazing on the relative abundance of Microcystis co-cultured with a eukaryotic phytoplankton (Cryptomonas) was evaluated in a series of 6-day laboratory experiments. Grazer effects were tested in incubations where the growth of each phytoplankton in the presence or absence of the copepod Notodiaptomus iheringi was monitored in 1 L co-cultures, starting with a 6-fold initial dominance of Cryptomonas by biomass. Compared to the no grazer controls, N. iheringi reduced the growth of both phytoplankton, but Cryptomonas growth was reduced to negative values while Microcystis growth continued positively despite grazers. Hence, in a matter of 6 days selective grazing by N. iheringi increased the biomass of Microcystis relative to Cryptomonas by an order of magnitude compared to controls, and thus, facilitated the dominance of this cyanobacterium. To account for the potential effect of allelopathy, we performed a secondary experiment comparing the abundance and growth rate of Microcystis and Cryptomonas in single and mixed co-cultures in the absence of grazers. The growth rate of Microcystis was unaffected by the presence or relative abundance of Cryptomonas, and vice versa, indicating no allelopathic effects. Our results suggest that selectively grazing zooplankton may facilitate cyanobacteria blooms by grazing on their eukaryotic phytoplankton competitors in nature. Given that selective grazers predominate zooplankton biomass in warmer waters, grazer facilitation of blooms may be a common but poorly understood regulator of plankton dynamics in a warmer and more eutrophic world.									17	0	0	0	12	0	17			1664-302X			WOS:000425949300001	29527199

There have been occasional unusually large catches of M, hyadesi, the latest being in 1995. Because of the importance of understanding the influence of the physical environment on fisheries for oceanic squid, and interest in developing a new fishery for id, hyadesi in the CCAMLR area, we examined specimens and data from the 1995 season and analysed 10 yr fisheries and remotely sensed oceanographic data sets from the area. The 1995 data show that M, hyadesi remains in the cool APFZ waters of the Falkland Current where it preys on oceanic fish and crustaceans and its distribution rarely extends over the Patagonian Shelf. The squid exploited by the fishery in 1995 were 6 to 12 mo old; females were immature but some males were fully mature. A remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) image revealed mesoscale features at the shelf break front between Patagonian Shelf water and APFZ water where the squid were caught. The appearance of M, hyadesi in the fishery over the last decade, including 1995, has been related to SST anomalies. Teleconnections probably exist between these anomalies, El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific and sub-decadal oceanographic instability in the Antarctic. Squid are short-lived and populations are Likely to be able to respond rapidly to environmental change. However, it is not clear at what stage in the life cycle of M. hyadesi these oceanographic events exert their effect. We propose 2 alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses. Warm events prior to the appearance of M, hyadesi may favour reproductive success of the parent generation giving rise to a strong recruitment, or alternatively this cool water species may extend its range to the edge of the Patagonian Shelf early in the development of cold oceanographic events. In either case oceanographic effects are probably mediated via the squid's prey.									39	4	0	0	36	1	44			0171-8630			WOS:A1997XK65100018

The treatments were low prey, bluegill prey only, macroinvertebrates only, and bluegill plus macroinvertebrates. Across all treatments, growth in mass ( g) was unrelated to body size. Conversely, small individuals lost more energy (kJ) than large counterparts in all but the macroinvertebrate-only treatment. With low prey, overall growth of largemouth bass was negative, with losses varying among individuals by 30% and 60% for mass and energy content, respectively. Counterparts in bluegill-only pools also consistently lost mass and energy, with less variability (15% mass; 30% energy). In the macroinvertebrate-only treatment, 31% of individuals gained mass, reflecting the greatest range in mass (100%) and energy ( 60%) change. With macroinvertebrates plus bluegill, overall growth was generally negative, with intermediate variance among individuals. Variation in growth among individuals typically increased with the frequency that prey occurred in diets during sampling. Apparently, some individuals were inactive, foraged infrequently, and consistently lost intermediate quantities of mass and energy. Others were active and foraged with variable success. Because activity and growth vary among individuals as a function of prey composition during winter, prey assemblages during this season will affect patterns of first-year survival and cohort strength.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0378-1909			WOS:000185207800004		
J	Sommer, TR; Nobriga, ML; Harrell, WC; Batham, W; Kimmerer, WJ								Floodplain rearing of juvenile chinook salmon: evidence of enhanced growth and survival								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				58	2			325	333		10.1139/cjfas-58-2-325				FEB 2001	2001	In this study, we provide evidence that the Yolo Bypass, the primary floodplain of the lower Sacramento River (California, U.S.A.), provides better rearing and migration habitat for juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) than adjacent river channels. During 1998 and 1999, salmon increased in size substantially faster in the seasonally inundated agricultural floodplain than in the river, suggesting better growth rates. Similarly, coded-wire-tagged juveniles released in the floodplain were significantly larger at recapture and had higher apparent growth rates than those concurrently released in the river. Improved growth rates in the floodplain were in part a result of significantly higher prey consumption, reflecting greater availability of drift invertebrates. Bioenergetic modeling suggested that feeding success was greater in the floodplain than in the river, despite increased metabolic costs of rearing in the significantly warmer floodplain. Survival indices for coded-wire-tagged groups were somewhat higher for those released in the floodplain than for those released in the river, but the differences were not statistically significant. Growth, survival, feeding success, and prey availability were higher in 1998 than in 1999, a year in which flow was more moderate, indicating that hydrology affects the quality of floodplain rearing habitat. These findings support the predictions of the flood pulse concept and provide new insight into the importance of the floodplain for salmon.									195	0	0	0	173	0	197			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000166837700010

As evident in the Georges Bank haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) population, there is a strong relationship between recruitment success and processes occurring during the planktonic larval stage. This research sought new insights into the mechanisms controlling the recruitment process in fish populations using biological-physical modeling methods together with laboratory and field data sets. We created the first three-dimensional model of larval haddock on Georges Bank by coupling models of hydrodynamics, lower trophic levels, a single copepod species, and larval haddock. Interactions between feeding, metabolism, growth, vertical behavior, advection, predation, and the physical environment of larval haddock were quantitatively investigated using the coupled models. Particularly, the model was used to compare survival over the larval period and the sources of mortality in 1995 and 1998, 2years of disparate haddock recruitment. The results of model simulations suggest that the increased egg hatching rates and higher food availability, which reduced starvation and predation, in 1998 contributed to its larger year-class. Additionally, the inclusion of temperature-dependent predation rates produced model results that better agreed with observations of the mean hatch date of survivors. The results from this biophysical model imply that food limitation and its related losses to starvation and predation, especially from hatch to 7mm, may be responsible for interannual variability in recruitment and larval survival outside of the years studied.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000345603300006

Altitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which individuals perform seasonal elevational movements. Despite its geographic and taxonomic ubiquity, there is relatively little information about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence altitudinal migratory behaviour. Without this information, it is difficult to predict how rapid environmental changes will affect population viability of altitudinal migrants. To synthesize current knowledge, we compiled literature on altitudinal migration for all studied taxa, and identified the leading hypotheses explaining this behaviour. Studies of animal altitudinal migration cover many taxonomic lineages, with birds being the most commonly studied group. Altitudinal migration occurs in all continents except for Antarctica, but about a third of the literature focused on altitudinal migration in North America. Most research suggests that food and weather are the primary extrinsic drivers of altitudinal migration. In addition, substantial individual-level variation in migratory propensity exists. Individual characteristics that are associated with sex, dominance rank, and body size explain much of the variation in migratory propensity in partially migratory populations, but individual-level correlates are poorly known for most taxa. More research is needed to quantify the effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and climate change on altitudinal migrants. Demographic studies of individually marked populations would be particularly valuable for advancing knowledge of the cascading effects of environmental change on migratory propensity, movement patterns, and population viability. We conclude our review with recommendations for study designs and modelling approaches that could be used to narrow existing knowledge gaps, which currently hinder effective conservation of altitudinal migratory species.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000446427600017	29877015

The simulations are driven by a bio-physical environment predicted from a coupled ocean physical-biogeochemical model. This new version of SEAPODYM includes expanded definitions of habitat indices, movements, and natural mortality based on empirical evidences. A thermal habitat of tuna species is derived from an individual heat budget model. The feeding habitat is computed according to the accessibility of tuna predator cohorts to different vertically migrating and non-migrating micronekton (mid-trophic) functional groups. The spawning habitat is based on temperature and the coincidence of spawning fish with presence or absence of predators and food for larvae. The successful larval recruitment is linked to spawning stock biomass. Larvae drift with currents, while immature and adult tuna can move of their own volition, in addition to being advected by currents. A food requirement index is computed to adjust locally the natural mortality of cohorts based on food demand and accessibility to available forage components. Together these mechanisms induce bottom-up and top-down effects, and intra- (i.e. between cohorts) and inter-species interactions. The model is now fully operational for running multi-species, multi-fisheries simulations, and the structure of the model allows a validation from multiple data sources. An application with two tuna species showing different biological characteristics, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus), is presented to illustrate the capacity of the model to capture many important features of spatial dynamics of these two different tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. The actual validation is presented in a companion paper describing the approach to have a rigorous mathematical parameter optimization [Senina, I., Sibert, J., Lehodey, P., 2008. Parameter estimation for basin-scale ecosystem-linked population models of large pelagic predators: application to skipjack tuna. Progress in Oceanography]. once this evaluation and parameterization is complete, it may be possible to use the model for management of tuna stocks in the context of climate and ecosystem variability, and to investigate potential changes due to anthropogenic activities including global warming and fisheries pressures and management scenarios.

Nevertheless, the effects of fire-induced microclimatic shifts upon natural populations have been neglected. We measured the central tendency and variation of habitat structural and microclimatic variables in experimental plots of Neotropical savanna vegetation subjected to different fire regimes and assessed their effects upon lizard community structure. In addition, we evaluated the underlying mechanisms linking fire-induced environmental changes to community structure, by comparing lizard body condition and survival between different fire regimes. Fire suppression promoted increased tree density, canopy cover and leaf-litter weight, whereas burning had the opposite effects, reducing the habitat structural complexity. The best predictors of fire regimes were means of structural variables, but variances of microclimatic variables, and the reduced structural complexity of burned plots both increased and decreased the variation of microclimatic variables. Lizard community structure was chiefly described by a gradient of decreasing tree density, canopy cover and leaf litter weight with increasing fire severity. About half of the lizard species were favored in the fire-protected plot, while the other half was favored in the burned plots, with most of the variation being explained by structural variables. Lizard body condition and survival rates were not affected by fire regimes, suggesting a dominant role of thermoregulation opportunities afforded by habitat structure-instead of food availability or predation rates-upon community structure. Our findings indicate that even sporadic fires can have profound effects upon lizard communities and that protecting some habitat patches from burning is essential to maximize lizard diversity in Cerrado landscapes.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000494757400001

Despite a prominent top-down control in plankton food webs, a mechanistic understanding of A. aurita population dynamics and trophic interactions has been barely addressed. Here we develop a food web dynamic model to assess A. aurita role in the seasonal plankton dynamics of the Kiel Fjord, southwestern Baltic Sea. The model couples low trophic level dynamics, based on a classical Nutrient Phytoplankton Zooplankton Detritus (NPZD) model, to a stage-resolved copepod model (referencing Pseudocalanus sp.) and a jellyfish model (A. aurita ephyra and medusa) as consumers and predators, respectively. Simulations showed the relevance of high abundances of A. aurita, which appear related with warm winter temperatures, promoting a shift from a copepod-dominated food web to a ciliate and medusa dominated one. The model captured the intraspecific competition triggered by the medusae abundance and characterized by a negative relationship between population density and individual size/weight. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of an emergent trait such as size shaping the food web functioning, driving predation rates and population dynamics of A. aurita, driving its sexual reproductive strategy at the end of the pelagic phase.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000454161500005

The proportion of time coccinellids spent searching was correlated with air temperature, aphid density, and time of day. The relationship between searching and these variables differed among species. Mean walking speed ranged from 66.4 cm/min for C. maculata to 83.2 cm/min for H. tredecimpunctata and increased with temperature for all species. The frequency of short flights (<2 m) by beetles increased with temperature and decreased with increasing aphid density for all species, but the relationship of short flight frequency to these variables differed among species. The frequency of long flights (>2 m) was similar for all species and influenced by temperature and calendar date. The frequencies with which aphids were encountered and eaten were correlated with aphid density and temperature for H. convergens and H. tredecimpunctata. Despite over 250 h spent observing adult coccinellid behavior in the field, predation data were insufficient to develop a useful predation model.									34	1	0	0	35	1	35			1049-9644			WOS:000085743500002		
J	St-Pierre, Anne P.; Moreland, Hali R.; Gagnon, Patrick								Body size and competitor identity modulate prey consumption and feeding behaviour in a slow-moving benthic predator (Asterias rubens, Linneaus)								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				507				8	16		10.1016/j.jembe.2018.07.002				OCT 2018	2018	Understanding interactive effects of body size and competition on predator-prey relationships is key to predicting shifts in marine communities, particularly under accelerating pace of introductions of non-native species on a global scale. The common sea star, Asterias rubens (Linneaus), is a dominant indigenous predator in rocky subtidal habitats in eastern Canada, affecting community structure through sustained consumption of bivalve prey, mainly blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linneaus). Yet, considerable spatial and dietary overlaps with the indigenous rock crab, Cancer irroratus (Say), and introduced green crab, Carcinus maeneas (Linneaus), together with comparatively lower mobility in A. rubens, suggest the latter is poorly fit to compete with both crabs for M. edulis. A laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions for variably-sized M. edulis between small and large, 3-week starved A. rubens, and large C. irroratus or C. maenas (in one-on-one sea star versus crab face-offs) from southeastern Newfoundland. Mussel consumption in starved A. rubens, as well as four components of its natural feeding behaviour, were quantified over 75-h trials in relatively cold (similar to 4 to 5.5 degrees C) seawater representative of the current northern limit of C. maenas' distribution in the northwestern Atlantic. Results showed that starved A. rubens (1) prioritizes consumption, upon contacting mussel prey, over non-feeding activities such as responding to physical contacts initiated by crabs; (2) alters consumption and feeding behaviour under prolonged exposure to C. irroratus; and (3) increases movement in presence of green crab, more so in large than small sea stars. Overall, findings demonstrate that A. rubens' foraging decisions vary ontogenetically and with competitor's identity. Observed differences in consumption and feeding behaviour in A. rubens exposed to familiar (rock crab) or unfamiliar (green crab) competitors also suggest timing and frequency of encounters with competitors have the potential to alter feeding patterns throughout an organism's lifetime.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000442704000002

Evaluating connectivity for tropical amphibians using empirically derived resistance surfaces								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				25	4			928	942		10.1890/14-0833.1				JUN 2015	2015	Agricultural expansion continues to drive forest loss in species-rich tropical systems and often disrupts movement and distributions of organisms. The ability of species to occupy and move through altered habitats likely depends on the level of contrast between natural forest and surrounding land uses. Connectivity models, such as circuit theory models, are widely used in conservation biology, and their primary input consists of resistance surfaces representing movement costs associated with landscape features. Cost values are most frequently determined by expert opinion, which may not capture relevant levels of contrast among features. We developed resistance surfaces using experiments that represent different local mechanisms hypothesized to affect connectivity for two Neotropical amphibian species. Response ratios were calculated to translate experimental results to cost values used in connectivity modeling. We used relative abundance data in three land-cover types to generate resistance surfaces for evaluating independent support of models derived from experiments. Finally, we analyzed agreement among movement pathways predicted for each species and among three commonly used connectivity measures: Euclidean, least cost, and resistance distances. Experiments showed that extreme microclimates associated with altered habitats significantly increased desiccation and mortality risk for both species. Resistances estimated from microclimate experiments were concordant with those from survey data for both species. For one focal species, resistance estimates derived from predator encounter rates were also highly correlated with abundance-derived resistances. There was generally low agreement among the three alternative distance measures, which underscores the importance of choosing connectivity models that are most appropriate for the study objectives. Overall, similarity among linkages modeled for each species was high, but decreased with declining forest cover. Our results highlight the value of experiments for drawing inferences about processes in resistance modeling, as well as the need to consider model differences and species-specific responses when developing strategies to maintain connectivity.									21	0	0	0	17	0	21			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000355191900005	26465034

However, their combined effect on the mussel's defence to its predator has been poorly understood, which hinders us to understand the prey-predator interaction in marine environment. The thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus and its predator, the Asian paddle crab Charybdis japonica were exposed to three pH levels (7.3, 7.7, 8.1) at two concentrations of dissolved oxygen (2.0 mg L-1, 6.0 mg L-1) seawater. The anti-predatory responses of mussels, in terms of byssus thread production were analyzed after 72 h exposure. During the experiment, frequency of shedding stalks (mussels shed their byssal stalks to release themselves from attachment and allow locomotion) and number of byssus threads increased with time, were significantly reduced by hypoxia and low pH levels, and some interactions among time, predator, DO and pH were observed. As expected, the presence of the crab induced an anti-predator response in M. coruscus (significant increases in most tested parameters except the byssus thread length). Acidification and hypoxia significantly reduced byssus thread diamter at the end of the experiment, but not the byssus thread length. Cumulative byssus thread length and volume were significantly impaired by hypoxia and acidification. Our results highlight the significance of anti-predatory responses for adult mussel M. coruscus even under a stressful environment in which stress occurs through ocean acidification and hypoxia. By decreasing the strength of byssus attachment, the chance of being dislodged and consumed by crabs is likely increased. Our data suggest that there are changes in byssus production induced by hypoxia and acidification, which may affect predation rates on M. coruscus in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Artificial caterpillars moulded from plasticine have been widely used to compare attack rates in a variety of field settings. A recent study extended their use to latitudinal and elevational gradients and concluded that herbivores at lower latitudes and elevations suffer higher rates of attack by invertebrate predators. The present laboratory study examined effect of ambient temperature on the capacity of plasticine caterpillars to be marked by either a simulated attack of standardised force or by minute-long exposure to live ants. The effect of temperature on ease of marking of plasticine caterpillars was tested by preparing the plasticine at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 degrees C. The first three experiments tested the prepared plasticine at room temperature, immediately after removal of model prey from the preparation temperature and before it reached room temperature. A fourth experiment tested the plasticine caterpillars at the same temperatures at which they were prepared (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 degrees C), exposing the plasticine caterpillars to live ants. In all studies, the plasticine caterpillars were subsequently inspected for visible impressions by nine independent assessors who were unaware of the experimental aim or treatments. The assessors designated individual plasticine caterpillars as marked or unmarked. Here we report that plasticine caterpillars in the first three experiments were significantly more likely to be assessed as marked if the attack took place at higher temperatures. There was no significant difference in the incidence of visibility of attack marks on plasticine caterpillars at 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C but each successive temperature increment above 4 degrees C had a significant (p < 0.05) effect. Similarly, in the fourth experiment, there was no significant difference in the incidence of visible markings between 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C, significant (p < 0.05) increases for successive temperature increments above 4 degrees C, but a plateau such that the highest two temperature treatments did not differ. We conclude that the physical properties of plasticine make it an unsuitable substrate for prey models in studies where treatment sites have different temperatures such as those that have elevation or latitude gradients.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000452959200002		
J	Moller, Anders Pape								Parallel declines in abundance of insects and insectivorous birds in Denmark over 22 years								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				9	11			6581	6587		10.1002/ece3.5236				JUN 2019	2019	Farmers in most western countries have increased use of fertilizer and pesticides with impact on wild animals and plants, including the abundance of insects and their predators. I used 1,375 surveys of insects killed on car windscreens as a measure of insect abundance during 1997-2017 at two transects in Denmark. I cross-validated this method against three other methods for sampling insect abundance, and I investigated the effects of this measure of insect abundance on the abundance of breeding insectivorous birds. The abundance of flying insects was quantified using a windscreen resulting in reductions of 80% and 97% at two transects of 1.2 km and 25 km, respectively, according to general additive mixed model. Insect abundance increased with time of day, temperature, and June date, but decreased with wind resulting in a reduction by 54%. The abundance of insects killed on a car windscreen was strongly positively correlated with the abundance of insects caught in sweep nets and on sticky plates in the same study areas and at the same time as when insects were sampled using windscreens. The decline in abundance of insects on windscreens predicted the rate at which barn swallows Hirundo rustica fed their nestlings, even when controlling statistically for time of day, weather, and age and number of nestlings. The abundance of breeding pairs of three species of aerially insectivorous birds was positively correlated with the abundance of insects killed on windscreens at the same time in the same study area. This suggests a link between two trophic levels as affected by the temporal reduction in the abundance of flying insects. These findings are consistent with recent dramatic declines in insect abundance in Europe and North America with consequences for the rate of food provisioning of barn swallow offspring, the abundance of aerially insectivorous birds and bottom-up trophic cascades.									8	0	0	0	9	0	9			2045-7758			WOS:000472622400037	31236245	
J	Bliss, Margaret M.; Cecala, Kristen K.								Terrestrial Salamanders Alter Antipredator Behavior Thresholds Following Tail Autotomy								HERPETOLOGICA				73	2			94	99		10.1655/Herpetologica-D-16-00059.1				JUN 2017	2017	Prey animals avoid and survive encounters with predators through morphological and behavioral mechanisms, but these defenses can negatively affect fitness when individuals forgo foraging and reproductive opportunities. Although many studies have focused on the costs associated with antipredator behavior, few have evaluated how that behavior changes immediately following a nonlethal interaction with a predator. Understanding how differences in species ecology (i.e., autotomy and regeneration capabilities) influence antipredator behaviors prior to and following a predation attempt could provide insight into how animals cope with living among predators. In this study, we evaluated the antipredator and compensatory behaviors of Northern Zigzag Salamanders (Plethodon dorsalis) to determine how attempted predation affects behavioral responses to perceived predation risk. In a laboratory setting, we performed behavioral assays evaluating escape distance, exploratory movements, cover use, eating habits, and temperature preferences on individuals assigned to attacked (tail autotomy) and control treatments. We found differences in antipredator and compensatory responses between the two treatments, indicating that responses change relative to previous experiences with predators and present risk of predation. Our results indicate that attacked individuals had lower thresholds to elicit a behavioral response relative to control individuals and compensated for loss of resources and decreased locomotive ability by selecting warmer-temperature microhabitats. This study provides insight into how individuals cope with living amongst predators and emphasizes the need to explore behavioral changes following predation.									5	1	0	0	5	0	5			0018-0831	1938-5099		WOS:000403218900002

Several factors may potentially influence the grazing rates of protists on bacteria: temperature, bacterial abundance and production, and protist abundance. We inspected the relative importance of these variables in determining the specific grazing rates of flagellates (GRF), and total community grazing rates (GT) by analyzing a data set extracted from the literature. We included freshwater and marine environments, ranging from oligo- to eutrophic systems. As different methods to measure grazing rates (GRF and GT) were used by different authors, the data were also analyzed for possible differences among methods. As there were significant differences among certain methods, we classified them into 2 groups: (1) M1 methods, those that measured grazing rates (GRF and GT) through the uptake of fluorescent particles; and (2) M2 methods, those determining community grazing rates (GT) by dilution, inhibition, filtration, or the uptake of genetically marked bacteria. GT measured with M2 methods were systematically higher than those measured by M1. For studies with M1 methods, both GRF and GT were positively correlated to temperature, bacterial abundance and production. GT were also correlated to heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance. GT and GRF showed a different pattern of change with temperature, GRF increased with temperature within the range 0 to 30-degrees-C, while GT increased only up to 18-degrees-C. We did not find any satisfactory multiple regression model that explained the variation in the GT measurements with M2 methods. For M1 methods, flagellate abundance and temperatures below 18-degrees-C were the main factors affecting GT (the model explained 78 % of the variance). While bacterial and flagellate abundances were the main factors at higher temperatures, the model in this case explained only 19% of the variance. Grazing rates could be affected by other sources of variability not considered here (e.g. prey and predator size, chlorophyll). These effects could become much more conspicuous above certain temperatures (18-degrees-C in our study).									137	3	0	0	114	0	142			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1994NX76600016

Eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes can be dominated by an assemblage of detritivorous fish species. The trophic role of the pelagic fish Cyphocharax voga in two temperate turbid shallow lakes was analyzed through the study of its diet and foraging area. The results showed that C. voga consumed detritus, zoobenthos and zooplankton (95.77 %, 4.11 % and 0.12 % of total ash free dry mass ingested, respectively). Benthic invertebrates were the most abundant organisms ingested, representing 93 % of the total biomass. In particular, Leydigia louisi, ostracods and harpacticoid copepods contributed most in abundance and biomass. Pelagic prey, represented mainly by Bosmina (Neobosmina) huaronensis, constituted 7 % of the total biomass consumed by fish. Prey availability was determined in the open and littoral areas and in the lake bottom. C. voga showed a selectivity for crustaceans from the lake bottom. This evidence and the high consumption of detritus indicate that C. voga is exploiting the benthic food web. Thus, this fish can be considered a detritivorous species. This strategy seems suitable in turbid lakes (20-30 cm Secchi disc depth) where prey detection for visual predators is constrained. Moreover, as C. voga attains a high biomass in warm temperate eutrophic shallow lakes of South America, it might be contributing to the linkage of benthic and pelagic pathways, and detritus and benthic invertebrates may provide a subsidy for the pelagic food web.									10	0	0	0	8	1	10			1863-9135			WOS:000322771700007

Of 61 studies of aquatic ectotherms, increased rearing temperature (apparently not stressful for growth and development) caused a reduction in organism size at a given developmental stage in 55 cases (90.2%) and an increase in only six (9.8%).2. The six exceptions to the size-reduction rule included one diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum), one copepod (Salmincola salmoneus) and four species of mayfly (Ephemeroptera). The extent to which these exceptions could be explained by each of four mechanisms was investigated by comparing their life cycles and niches with those of other closely-related species.3. No satisfactory explanation could be found for the response of P. tricornutum, but mechanisms consistent with the response of S. salmoneus were: reduced risk of oxygen shortage, low risk of ectotherm predation and seasonal constraints on the life cycle. The latter may also help explain the four mayfly exceptions.

I explored how the risk of predation by vertebrates influenced the behavior of grasshoppers. I monitored the height in vegetation and the frequency of resting, moving, and feeding behaviors of both tethered and free-ranging grasshoppers under exposure to various predators. Grasshoppers protected from birds remained high in the vegetation, while those protected only from small mammals and lizards remained low in the vegetation. Grasshoppers exposed to all predators occupied an intermediate height. Lower positions in the vegetation were associated with cooler thermal conditions, lower feeding rates, and lower food availability. My results are consistent with the hypothesis that grasshoppers utilize different microhabitats to balance the trade-off between reducing mortality from predators and experiencing greater food availability, and warmer conditions.									48	0	0	0	47	2	52			0269-7653	1573-8477		WOS:000089346300005		
J	Turner, JT								The importance of small planktonic copepods and their roles in pelagic marine food webs								ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES				43	2			255	266						APR 2004	2004	The importance of small planktonic copepods and their roles in pelagic marine food webs. Zoological Studies 43(2): 255-266. Small planktonic marine copepods (< 1 mm in length) are the most abundant metazoans on Earth. Included are adults and copepodites of calanoid genera such as Paracalanus, Clausocalanus, and Acartia; cyclopoid genera such as Oithona, Oncaea, and Corycaeus; planktonic harpacticoids of the genus Microsetella; and nauplii of almost all copepod species. Despite the abundance of small copepods, they have historically been undersampled due to the use of nets with meshes >200-333 mum. Recent studies have shown, however, that when appropriate net meshes of 100 pm or less are used, small copepods vastly exceed the abundance and sometimes the biomass of larger ones. Failure to adequately account for small copepods may cause serious underestimations of zooplankton abundance and biomass, the copepod grazing impact on phytoplankton primary production, zooplankton-mediated fluxes of chemicals and materials, and trophic interactions in the sea. The feeding ecology of small copepods is less well-known than that of adults of larger copepod species, such as members of the genus Calanus. Further, most feeding information for small copepods is for coastal genera such as Acartia, rather than for offshore taxa. Although it is generally assumed that small copepods, including nauplii, feed primarily upon small-sized phytoplankton cells, most such information comes from rearing or feeding studies on limited laboratory diets. There have been few examinations of actual copepod feeding on mixed diets of natural phytoplankton and microzooplankton found in the sea, but some of those have produced surprises. For instance, some species of Oithona and Paracalanus and even nauplii of Arctic Calanus spp. may feed primarily as predators upon heterotrophic protists, rather than as grazers of phytoplankton. Also, nauplii of various tropical copepod species have been shown to feed upon bacterioplankton. Thus, numerous basic questions remain as to the feeding ecology and grazing/predation impact of small copepods in the sea. Despite limited knowledge of what small copepods eat, it is clear that many higher-trophic-level consumers eat them. Numerous studies have shown that copepod nauplii, Oithona spp., and other small copepods are important prey of fish larvae and other planktivores. Small copepods exhibit a variety of reproductive strategies to compensate for losses to their populations due to predation. These include having high fecundity and growth rates, when not limited by insufficient food; having high reproduction and growth rates at warmer temperatures; having limited motion and low respiration rates, allowing the investment of more energy in reproduction; and having extended longevity to maximize lifetime reproductive output. Thus, small copepods are important links in marine food webs, serving as major grazers of phytoplankton, as components of the microbial loop, and as prey for ichthyoplankton and other larger pelagic carnivores. Our present inadequate understanding of the true abundance, biomass, trophic ecology, and role of small copepods in biogenic fluxes precludes proper understanding of the ecology of the sea.					8th International Conference on Copepoda8th International Conference on Copepoda	JUL 21-26, 2002JUL 21-26, 2002	Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium; World Assoc Copepodologists; Natl Sci Council; Fisheries Adm; Environm Protect Adm; Minist Educ; Minist Foreign Affairs; Natl Ctr Ocean Res; Keeling City Govt; Acad Sinica, Inst ZoolNatl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium; World Assoc Copepodologists; Natl Sci Council; Fisheries Adm; Environm Protect Adm; Minist Educ; Minist Foreign Affairs; Natl Ctr Ocean Res; Keeling City Govt; Acad Sinica, Inst Zool	Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Keelung, TAIWANNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Keelung, TAIWAN	429	21	4	0	350	18	456			1021-5506	1810-522X		WOS:000222853500012		
J	Wang, Lianggen; Du, Feiyan; Wang, Xuehui; Li, Yafang; Ning, Jiajia								Distribution and role of the genus Oithona (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) in the South China Sea								OCEANOLOGIA				59	3			300	310		10.1016/j.oceano.2017.03.009				JUL-SEP 2017	2017	The relationships between the small cyclopoid copepod Oithona and hydrological factors, phytoplankton and ichthyoplankton were evaluated using the data obtained in the central South China Sea (SCS) in summer 2014. The genus abundance ranged from 6.00 ind. m(-3) to 93.75 ind. m(-3) with high abundance band occurring in the branch of SCS Monsoon Jet. The lower temperature and higher salinity in the surface water of the band than other zones indicated that deep water intrusion was a positive factor for aggregation of the genus. The community structure of the genus was dominated by Oithona plumifera and Oithona similis made up 97% of the genus abundance associated with Oithona tenuis. The result of db-RDA analysis showed that the community structure of the genus was affected by temperature, Chl a, larval fishes and fish spawns, and temperature was the most important limiting factor. The result of GAMs analysis showed that abundance of O. tenuis, and copepodites were affected by Chl a, larval fishes and fish spawns; abundance of O. similis was affected by Chl a and fish spawns; and abundance of O. plumifera was affected by Chl a and larval fishes. Therefore, we suggest that the branch of SCS Monsoon Jet and deep water intrusion favor aggregation of plankton in the central SCS in summer. We confirm that the temperature is the limiting factor to the reproduction of the genus Oithona in tropic seas and the genus Oithona is a food-web linker between primary production and larval fishes in the central SCS.

However, logistic constraints can prevent researchers from using capture- mark-recapture methods, a robust approach to estimate abundance. Our objective was to determine the correlation between abundance estimates of Arctic lemmings obtained from live-trapping data with spatially explicit capture-recapture models (SECR; N/ha) and abundance indices obtained from snap-trapping along trap lines (N/100 trap-nights), winter nest sampling along transects with distance sampling models (N/ha), burrow counting within quadrats (N/100 m(2)), and incidental observations (N/100 observer-hr). We also evaluated the impact of reduced sampling effort on the bias and precision of each abundance estimate. Data from brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) and collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) were collected each year from 2007 to 2016 on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Snap-trapping (r = 0.90) and incidental observations (r = 0.92) yielded the highest correlations with live-trapping densities for brown lemmings, the most abundant species. When combining abundance of both lemming species, snap-trapping (r = 0.77) and incidental observations (r = 0.90) also yielded the highest correlations. Indices from winter nests and burrows were also correlated (r > 0.50) with live-trapping densities, but to a lesser degree. We found that bias generally increased when effort was reduced for methods involving modeling of capture or detection probabilities (i.e., live-trapping, winter nests), but remained low for the other methods. In contrast, precision of estimates remained high when using SECR models, but decreased substantially for the other methods during years of low lemming abundance. Non-convergence of SECR and distance sampling models generally increased when reducing effort and was frequent in years of low lemming abundance. Interestingly, collecting > 200 h of incidental observations generated highly reliable estimates of lemming abundance compared to results from live-trapping, indicating that such non-invasive method can provide valuable data at low cost. We provide guidelines on other invasive or non-invasive methods that can be used when small mammals cannot be live-trapped and suggest the effort required to achieve a given precision.									8	0	0	0	5	1	8			2150-8925			WOS:000427091200012		
J	Belden, LK; Blaustein, AR					Belden, Lisa/0000-0002-3514-3920			Exposure of red-legged frog embryos to ambient UV-B radiation in the field negatively affects larval growth and development								OECOLOGIA				130	4			551	554		10.1007/s00442-001-0843-y				FEB 2002	2002	Exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) has a wide array of effects on aquatic organisms, including amphibians, and has been implicated as a possible factor contributing to global declines and range reductions in amphibian populations. Both lethal and sublethal effects of UV-B exposure have been documented for many amphibian species at various life-history stages. Some species, such as red legged frogs, Rana aurora, appear to be resistant to current ambient levels of UV-B, at least at the embryonic and larval stages, despite the fact that they have experienced range reductions in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA. However, UV-B is lethal to embryonic and larval R. aurora at levels slightly above those currently experienced during development. Therefore, we predicted that exposure of embryos to ambient UV-B radiation would result in sublethal effects on larval growth and development. We tested this by exposing R. aurora embryos to ambient UV-B in the field and then raising individuals in the laboratory for I month after hatching. Larvae that were exposed to UV-B as embryos were smaller and less developed than the non-exposed individuals I month post-hatching. These types of sublethal effects of UV-B exposure indicate that current levels of UV-B could already be influencing amphibian development.									49	0	0	0	50	2	53			0029-8549			WOS:000174695700008	28547256

At temperatures between 5 and 15 degrees C, mean group S increased exponentially with increasing T (S= a e(bT)) and the effect of temperature (b= 0.082, Q(10)= 2.27) was not significantly different among the groups (over the 8-fold difference in fish sizes of early- and post- settlement juveniles). Differences in mean S among individuals within each group were quite large ( coefficient of variation= 40-80%). Swimming data for juveniles and those collected for groups of 0.4, 0.7 and 0.9 cm standard length (LS) larvae were combined to assess the effect of body size on S. At 8 degrees C, S (mm s(-1)) increased with L-S (mm) according to: S= 0.26L(S) (Phi) -5.28L(S)(-1), where Phi= 1.55L(S)(-0.08). Relative S (body lengths s(-1)) was related to L-S by a dome-shaped relationship having a maximum value (0.49 body lengths s(-1)) at 18.5 - 19 mm L-S corresponding to the sizes of fish at the end of larval-juvenile metamorphosis. Previous larval cod IBM's using a cruise-predator mode likely overestimated rates of foraging (prey searching and encounters) by a factor of similar to 2, whereas foraging rates in pause-travel models are closer to estimates of swimming velocities obtained in this and other laboratory studies.									47	0	0	0	38	0	47			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000238741000007

Yet landscape-scale changes to biodiversity and community structure often emerge from processes operating at local scales. One common process that can explain changes in biodiversity and community structure is the creation of abrupt habitat edges, which, in turn, generate edge effects. Such effects, while incredibly common, can be highly variable across space and time; however, we currently lack a general analytical framework that can adequately capture such spatio-temporal variability. We extend previous approaches for estimating edge effects to a non-linear mixed modeling framework that captures such spatio-temporal heterogeneity and apply it to understand how agricultural land-uses alter wildlife communities. We trapped small mammals along a conservation-agriculture land-use interface extending 375 m into sugarcane plantations and conservation land-uses at three sites during dry and wet seasons in Swaziland, Africa. Sugarcane plantations had significant reductions in species richness and heterogeneity, and showed an increase in community similarity, suggesting a more homogenized small mammal community. Furthermore, our modeling framework identified strong variation in edge effects on communities across sites and seasons. Using small mammals as an indicator, intensive agricultural practices appear to create high-density communities of generalist species while isolating interior species in less than 225 m. These results illustrate how agricultural land-use can reduce diversity across the landscape and that effects can be masked or magnified, depending on local conditions. Taken together, our results emphasize the need to create or retain natural habitat features in agricultural mosaics.									27	0	0	0	23	1	27			1932-6203			WOS:000326405300178	24040269	
J	Lamb, Robert W.; Smith, Franz; Witman, Jon D.								Consumer mobility predicts impacts of herbivory across an environmental stress gradient								ECOLOGY				101	1						10.1002/ecy.2910		NOV 2019		JAN 2020	2020	Environmental stress impedes predation and herbivory by limiting the ability of animals to search for and consume prey. We tested the contingency of this relationship on consumer traits and specifically hypothesized that herbivore mobility relative to the return time of limiting environmental stress would predict consumer effects. We examined how wave-induced water motion affects marine communities via herbivory by highly mobile (fish) vs. slow-moving (pencil urchin) consumers at two wave-sheltered and two wave-exposed rocky subtidal locations in the Galapagos Islands. The exposed locations experienced 99th percentile flow speeds that were 2-5 times greater than sheltered locations, with mean flow speeds >33 cm/s vs. <16 cm/s, 2-7 times higher standing macroalgal cover and 2-3 times lower cover of crustose coralline algae than the sheltered locations. As predicted by the environmental stress hypothesis (ESH), there was a negative relationship between mean flow speed and urchin abundance and herbivory rates on Ulva spp. algal feeding assays. In contrast, the biomass of surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) and parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarinae) was positively correlated with mean flow speed. Ulva assays were consumed at equal rates by fish at exposed and sheltered locations, indicating continued herbivory even when flow speeds surpassed maximum reported swimming speeds at a rate of 1-2 times per minute. Modeled variation in fish species richness revealed minimal effects of diversity on herbivory rates at flow speeds <40 cm/s, when all species were capable of foraging, and above 120 cm/s, when no species could forage, while increasing diversity maximized herbivory rates at flow speeds of 40-120 cm/s. Two-month herbivore exclusion experiments during warm and cool seasons revealed that macroalgal biomass was positively correlated with flow speed. Fish limited macroalgal development by 65-91% at one exposed location but not the second and by 70% at the two sheltered locations. In contrast, pencil urchins did not affect algal communities at either exposed location, but reduced macroalgae by 87% relative to controls at both sheltered locations. We propose an extension of the ESH that is contingent upon mobility to explain species-specific changes in feeding rates and consumer effects on benthic communities across environmental gradients.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000497128900001	31605535

Here we report quantitative estimates for the contribution of littoral versus pelagic sources in supporting the three most important planktivorous fish of a deep, large, subalpine lake in Italy. Contributions of pelagic (p) and littoral (q) signatures of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes were detected in fish muscular tissue by applying a dynamic baseline mixing model. This model integrates tissue-specific metabolic turnover (m) and fish growth (k) rates over baselines delta C-13 seasonality. Annual fluctuations for both pelagic and littoral baselines were not negligible (Delta C = 10% and 8%, respectively). We calculated that they could not be ignored, since contributions of pelagic and littoral signatures would be largely underestimated (up to 30% p and 13% q for whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), respectively). When fish relied upon pelagic consumers, stepwise N-15-enrichment (E) of pelagic preys linearly decreased with prey-size-specific predation pressure. Therefore, longer food webs would be proportionally less stepwise N-15-enriched than shorter ones.									14	0	0	0	8	0	14			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000332461000011

Comparisons showed that the differentiation between the two larval types occurred after the third larval stage. In the field, non-overwintering larvae pupate in September, emerge in October and produce a second annual generation, while overwintering larvae begin to grow more slowly from the 3rd instar onward, then overwinter to ultimately reach a larger size than the non-overwintering larvae and to pupate in September. Adults emerge in October. Larval development at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C was investigated under a photoperiod of L:D = 12:12. At 15 degrees C all larvae died as 4th instars, but from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C larval phases became increasingly shorter, while at 35 degrees C they lengthened again. Larval feeding capacity increased with higher temperature up to 30 degrees C, but decreased at 35 degrees C. Under three photoperiods, i.e., L:D = 16:8, 12:12 and 8:16 at 25 degrees C, the larval period was shortest under L:D of 16:8 and longest under L:D = 8:16. Feeding capacity of the larvae exhibited a positive correlation with the duration of the dark period. Larvae under longer periods of illumination pupated considerably earlier than those kept one under shorter periods of light exposure. No significant differences in the numbers of overwintering larvae were found in connection with different temperatures and photoperiods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Harmata, Alan R.; Restani, Marco								LEAD, MERCURY, SELENIUM, AND OTHER TRACE ELEMENTS IN TISSUES OF GOLDEN EAGLES FROM SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA, USA								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				49	1			114	124		10.7589/2012-01-004				JAN 2013	2013	Lead-based rifle bullets, used in game hunting and recreational shooting, fragment when striking bone and soft tissues. Lead fragments may be ingested by birds scavenging offal piles or nonretrieved carcasses and therefore pose a poisoning risk. We captured and sampled 74 Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in southwestern Montana, USA, from 2008 to 2010 to evaluate levels of lead, mercury, selenium, and 13 other trace elements in blood and feathers. Lead was detected in blood of most (97%, n=70) eagles; mean blood level was 0.26 parts per million (ppm). Most eagles (65%) had background levels (<0.2 ppm), 29% had elevated levels (0.2-0.5 ppm), 13% had chronic levels (0.51-1.0 ppm), and 3% had acute levels (>1.0 ppm) in blood. Lead in blood decreased from winter to spring. Resident eagles had higher lead levels than eagles of unknown residency. Mercury was detected in few eagles, whereas selenium was detected in all, but at a low level (0.36 ppm). Other chemical elements in blood were at low or biologically appropriate levels. Lead in feathers (n=29) was correlated with blood lead (P=0.010), as was mercury in blood and feathers (n=48; P=0.003). Concentrations of lead and mercury in feathers were higher in adults than in juveniles and immatures (P<0.016) and both elements tended to increase with age. Selenium in feathers (n=48) appeared stable across plumage classes. Although detection rates of lead in blood of eagles captured in spring increased from 1985-1993 to 2008-2010, mean levels decreased (P<0.023) between periods, as did proportions of eagles exhibiting above background levels (>0.2 ppm; P<0.02).									18	0	0	0	16	0	18			0090-3558	1943-3700		WOS:000313538100012	23307377	
J	Linn, Catherine Anne; Griebeler, Eva Maria								Habitat Preference of German Mantis religiosa Populations (Mantodea: Mantidae) and Implications for Conservation								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				45	4			829	840		10.1093/ee/nvw056				AUG 2016	2016	In Germany, the thermophilic European mantid (Mantis religiosa L.) is endangered. Here, we study habitat requirements during its life, and discuss the applicability of the two conservation measures grazing and mowing to this insect species. At two study sites in south-western Germany, which were each subject to one of these measures, we recorded structural and climatic conditions within different microhabitats. We also conducted capture-mark-recapture studies for adult M. religiosa, and mapped adult roosting, oothecae deposition, egg hatching, and imaginal molting in microhabitats over two vegetation periods. In order to assess microhabitat preference of M. religiosa during its life, and identify climatic conditions driving preferences, we applied the Lille habitat preference index and conducted logistic regression analysis for life phases. Our results suggest that temperature is important for egg and nymph development. For egg deposition, females preferred solid substrates with high heat-storing capacities, as those attenuate the negative influence of cold weather periods on egg development. Being ambush predators, males and females preferred roosting sites with sufficient shelter and high prey abundance. Contrary to our expectation, the conservation measures reduced adult population sizes, and presumably reproduction rates. We thus suggest that mowing during the adult phase should reduce vegetation height to a moderate level to keep prey abundance high. Mowing with a clearing saw or grazing over a short period in small fenced areas should be preferred over prolonged grazing, as grazers collaterally stamp down the vegetation. Grazers indirectly reduce prey availability by deteriorating prevailing microclimatic conditions.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000381911600007	27271947

In agro-ecosystems, biodiversity is usually the calculation of comparative numbers and species of organisms. Insects are the largest and most diverse group of organisms in the world. During present study, different wheat fields of district Sialkot were sampled for the assessment of diversity and relative abundance of insect fauna. Collection of insects was carried out by the sweep net technique. A total of 896 specimens of insect fauna belonging to 15 species and 9 families were collected. Overall, maximum species diversity was observed during the month of April followed by the month of March. Highest relative abundance of sampled fauna was recorded in March (37.05%) followed by April (34.37%) while it was least in June (5.80%). This variation is probably due to temporal fluctuations observed in different months during which sampling was carried out. Overall, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) or aphids was the most dominant species (17.52%) followed by Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (11.83%). The highly captured predator was C. septempunctata and prey was S. graminum. Simple linear regression showed the highest association between C. septempunctata (larva) and Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (R-2 = 0.945). The Shannon diversity index represented the significant results regarding Diversity (H'= 2.64), Evenness (E = 0.82) and Dominance (D = 0.08) of insect fauna sampled in 2017. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the significant effect of rainfall and temperature on most of the sampled species. The current study would be helpful in future for the application of species-specific biological control in wheat field that will lead towards sustainability of agro-ecosystem. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Habitat degradation modifies the sensory landscape within which predator-prey interactions occur, with implications for olfactory-mediated behaviours. Predator na ve settlement stage damselfish rely on conspecific damage-released odours (i.e., alarm odours) to inform risk assessments. Yet, species such as the Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, become unable to respond appropriately to these cues when living in dead-degraded coral habitats, leading to increased mortality through loss of vigilance. Reef fish predators also rely on odours from damaged prey to locate, assess prey quality and engage in prey-stealing, but it is unknown whether their responses are also modified by the change to dead degraded coral habitats. Implications for prey clearly depend on how their predatory counterparts are affected, therefore the present study tested whether olfactory-mediated foraging responses in the dusky dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus, a common predator of P. amboinensis, were similarly affected by coral degradation. A y-maze was used to measure the ability of Ps. fuscus to detect and move towards odours, against different background water sources. Ps. fuscus were exposed to damage-released odours from juvenile P. amboinensis, or a control cue of seawater, against a background of seawater treated with either healthy or dead-degraded hard coral. Predators exhibited an increased time allocation to the chambers of y-mazes injected with damage-released odours, with comparable levels of response in both healthy and dead-degraded coral treated waters. In control treatments, where damage-released odours were replaced with a control seawater cue, fish showed no increased preference for either chamber of the y-maze. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated foraging behaviours may persist in Ps. fuscus within dead-degraded coral habitats. Ps. fuscus may consequently gain a sensory advantage over P. amboinensis, potentially altering the outcome of predator-prey interactions.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000404607900020	28658295

(Homoptera: Psyllidae) in pistachio orchards in Turkey. The adult longevity, fecundity, life table parameters and prey consumption of A. minki fed on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs were studied at combinations of three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 +/- A 1A degrees C) with two relative humidity (RH) levels (40 and 65 +/- A 5%). Studies indicated that temperature and RH significantly affected adult longevity, fecundity and prey consumption of A. minki. The greatest adult female longevity was 116.0 days at 20A degrees C and 65% RH; the shortest adult female longevity was 27.5 days at 30A degrees C and 40% RH. At all tested temperatures, the oviposition period and prey consumption of both females and males significantly decreased at low RH compared to high RH. The highest and lowest total fecundities were 276.0 eggs (at 20A degrees C and 65% RH) and 42.4 eggs (at 25A degrees C and 40% RH), respectively. The intrinsic rates of natural increase (r (m)) at 40 and 65% RH were 0.049 and 0.076 at 20A degrees C, 0.072 and 0.096 at 25A degrees C and 0.076 and 0.112 at 30A degrees C, respectively. The highest mean numbers of E. kuehniella eggs consumed by females and males were 859.6 (at 20A degrees C) and 515.3 (at 25A degrees C) at 65% RH, respectively; the lowest were 183.3 (at 20A degrees C) and 95.5 (at 25A degrees C) at 40% RH, respectively.									6	1	0	0	8	0	9			0003-6862			WOS:000289895900008		
J	Klutsch, Jennifer G.; Classens, Gail; Whitehouse, Caroline; Cahill, James F., Jr.; Erbilgin, Nadir								Density-dependent responses of mountain pine beetle to its pheromones and host volatiles in naive lodgepole pine stands								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				472						118257	10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118257				SEP 15 2020	2020	Mountain pine beetle has expanded its host range into naive lodgepole pine forests in western Canada and killed a large number of pine trees. Synthetic attractants mainly bark beetle pheromones and host monoterpenes attached to traps are typically used to monitor beetle populations within its range. Despite well-established differences in beetle host selection behavior between endemic and outbreak population densities, the influence of population density on the response of mountain pine beetle to the synthetic attractants is poorly understood. Over three years, we tested the effects of different release rates of female mountain pine beetle aggregation pheromone (trans-verbenol) and two host monoterpenes (terpinolene and mycrene) and local beetle population density on trap catches of mountain pine beetle. We estimated local mountain pine beetle population densities using the number of dead trees observed in the previous year's aerial detection survey. During the first three weeks of the flight period, the lures with low release rates of all components captured more mountain pine beetle with increasing beetle population density and the lures with a high release rate of trans-verbenol plus a low release rate of host monoterpenes were preferred by beetles in low population density sites. We also found a temporal shift in attraction patterns. As the flight period progressed, the preference for low trans-verbenol release rate lures was less pronounced at high mountain pine beetle densities. No sex-specific responses of mountain pine beetles, along with number of competitor and predatory beetles of mountain pine beetle, were found for a particular attractant. These results provide evidence that mountain pine beetle has a density dependent response to attractants and can assess available semiochemicals cues to ensure successful host colonization depending on their density and the flight period. Overall, this study can improve the efficacy of current semiochemical-based monitoring tools, which are essential to implementing informed mitigation strategies for mountain pine beetle especially while they are in a sub-outbreak stage in the expanded distribution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1127	1872-7042		WOS:000550055600034

Sun coffee farms are widespread but they are likely to simplify the landscape and degrade biodiversity. In this study, we examined the effect of three land uses associated with coffee production (sun coffee, shaded coffee and natural patches) on species diversity among omnivorous and predatory ants and ground beetles. The study was carried out in Caldono, Cauca in southwestern Colombia; we sampled eight plots of each land use in two collecting sessions. Specimens were captured with pitfall traps and mini-Winkler bags. We sampled each plot for 48 h in each session. Species representativeness for ants was higher than for ground beetles, and species richness of both taxa was higher in natural patches than on coffee farms. Omnivorous ants were more abundant on sun coffee farms, and a higher richness and abundance of omnivorous ground beetles was also observed. Sun coffee farm communities were distant from natural patches, and there were shaded coffee farms in between them. As for indicator species, we found 24 for ants and four for ground beetles. High heterogeneity of landscape and intermingling of farms with other land uses is more important for maintaining biodiversity than considering each land use independently. Although this fauna could be moving across the landscape, small vegetation patches are key to the survival of several species. In general, coffee plantations under the sun favor the generalist species whilst shaded coffee is friendlier with biodiversity, and should be promoted. Finally, we found that severe drought homogenizes tendencies of species richness, and widely favors generalist species.					15th North American Agroforestry Conference15th North American Agroforestry Conference	JUN 27-29, 2017JUN 27-29, 2017		Virginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VAVirginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-4366	1572-9680		WOS:000482399600014

Growth after hatching was determined using daily otolith increment widths at distances of 37.5 to 137.5 mu m from the core in fish from 3 selected year classes (1991, 1992 and 1996) and compared among post-larvae (body lengths 20 to 30 mm) sampled on the shelf in May-June and 0-group juveniles sampled during the autumn in fjords and Barents Sea nurseries. In general, daily otolith growth after hatching was significantly higher in the larvae rather than in the surviving population of 0-group herring at comparable sizes. Larvae with a more similar growth rate to that of 0-group were those that hatched early in the year, were the slowest growers and were located close to the coast and far to the north in mid-May. We therefore propose that survival until 0-group may increase by hatching earlier in the year. This may result in a faster northward larval drift in colder ambient temperature. Although this will induce slower growth, the mechanism behind increased survival is larval drift trajectories and early arrival in nursery areas prior to the increasing predation risk developing northwards during spring warming. However, size (not growth rate) may still be important, as early hatching also may result in earlier metamorphosis, despite the slower growth.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000485730200003

The mean capture per unit effort (CPUE) was significantly higher when the mean of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) experienced by the albacore in winter and spring of its life history (NAO(life)) was negative than when the NAO(life) was positive. A statistically significant negative relationship was obtained between NAO(life) and the probability of a CPUE value for an age class and year being higher than the average CPUE for all the cohorts in that age class. The results suggest that local abundance of albacore in a spawning grounds could be related to environmental factors dependent on the NAO and that there may be a cohort-age effect. It is hypothesized that factors dependent on the NAO, such as the abundance variation of small pelagic fishes as a response to the NAO variability, could have a cumulative effect over the good biological condition (fitness) of a long-living fish predator such as the albacore.									14	0	0	0	14	1	14			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000297288200011

The biological control agent Gratiana boliviana Spaeth (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is providing adequate control of TSA stands in South and Central Florida. However, poor or no establishment of this agent has occurred in northern Florida. The goal of this study was to examine the mortality factors that influence the population dynamics of G. boliviana in Florida. Horizontal life tables were constructed by following cohorts of individuals in the laboratory and inside closed and open cages at field sites in Central and North Florida. Fertility life table parameters were estimated using laboratory and field data. In addition, as part of a vertical life table analysis, TSA plants were sampled every two weeks in pastures in Central Florida, and counts of all G. boliviana and other herbivores and predators were recorded. Survival to adulthood was similar between Central and North Florida (open cages: 12-19%). Intrinsic mortality (laboratory data) and biotic factors (predation) together accounted for 75% of the mortality of immature stages. Survival of beetles in a natural population determined from vertical life tables was 5%. A complex of three mirid species (Engytatus modesta Distant, Tupiocoris notatus Distant, and Macrolophus sp.) were the most abundant predators found in the field, and are known to feed on G. boliviana eggs and larvae. Positive growth rates (r(m) = 0.3) during the summer and early fall allow the beetle population to increase and provide suppression of TSA in Central Florida. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Laboratory and field experiments showed that the hunting performance of two flower-dwelling crab spiders, Misumenops asperatus and Misumenoides formosipes, was thermally insensitive over a broad range of temperatures normally experienced by these spiders.2. In the laboratory, HP, a behavioural metric of spider hunting performance, was similar for spiders of a given species over an approximate to 30 degrees C temperature range.3. Spiders in the field captured predominantly hymenopterans and dipterans, and field hunting performance, measured as the number of prey captured per spider per day, also proved to be unaffected by temperature.4. These findings counter the general rule that physiological/ecological performance in terrestrial arthropods is temperature dependent.5. Freedom from temperature constraints on the capacity of crab spiders to capture prey may be due to the use of venom and/or to muscle physiological adaptations for anaerobic metabolism.6. Wide thermal performance breadth increases the spectrum of prey available to M. asperatus and M. formosipes by allowing spiders to hunt prey active during cooler periods of the day as well as those active during warmer periods.7. Wide thermal performance breadth also benefits M. asperatus and M. formosipes due to adult phenology; both species experience a seasonal temperature shift during the adult phase.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0307-6946			WOS:000082489500013		
J	Hedd, A; Ryder, JL; Cowen, LL; Bertram, DF								Inter-annual variation in the diet, provisioning and growth of Cassin's auklet at Triangle Island, British Columbia: responses to variation in ocean climate								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				229				221	232		10.3354/meps229221				2002	2002	We studied parental provisioning and chick growth rates of Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus at Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, from 1996 to 1999. Auklet reproductive performance and ocean climate conditions during these years were highly variable, and reflected in the diet composition. Chick growth was maximal when the diet was predominated by copepods, in particular Neocalanus cristatus. Provisioning and growth were high in 1999, intermediate in 1997 and poor in 1998. Exceptional was 1996, when growth was low but provisioning rates were high. Provisioning and growth were depressed late in 1997 and throughout 1998 when larval rockfish Sebastes spp. (5200 cal g(-1)) replaced N. cristatus (6236 cal g(-1)) in the nestling diet. Zooplankton surveys indicated that N, cristatus was substantially more abundant in May 1999 than in May 1998, and during 1999 the auklets foraged in areas with the highest concentrations of copepods. Through impacts on prey availability, variation in ocean climate affects the reproductive performance of Cassin's auklet. Performance tends to be favorable in years when spring is late and cold, and poor when spring is early and warm. Equations for predicting food delivery rates from 24 h mass changes of chicks were highly year-specific, precluding their application in other years or at other sites where Cassin's auklets breed. Between-year differences were also found in relationships between adult provisioning and chick growth. These were strongly positively related in 1999, positively related in 1996 and 1997, but unrelated in 1998; differences attributed to the magnitude of temporal variation in the nestling diet. Finally, we detected annual differences in parental response to chick needs. In 1999, parents delivered more food to chicks in poor condition and less to those in better condition, responses not observed in 1998, Different responses between years may have reflected variation in the availability of prey.									53	0	0	0	49	0	56			0171-8630			WOS:000175144400020

The test system consists of the predacious mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer Canestrini) and, as prey, the collembolan Folsomia fimetaria L. in a microcosm (5.5 cm high x 6.0 cm in diameter) with 30 g humidified soil. F. fimetaria is provided with bakers yeast as food source. The model simulates (i) the population development of the test animals in synchronous cultures before the test, (ii) the selection of the test animals from the synchronous cultures and (iii) predator-prey interactions with and without the presence of dimethoate during the test and extraction periods. The driving variable is the temperature dependent food demands of the organisms. Both species were simulated with separate male and female populations, which were divided into a number of life stages. Thus the model handles very complicated predator-prey interactions taking the different interactions between different instars into consideration. The simulated test results were found to be very sensitive to changes in predator search rate, capture efficiency, habitat overlap, the amount of stored reserves of H. aculeifer at test start and the survival and reproduction of F. fimetaria, The simulations constitute the foundation for suggestions for further improvement of the test system.

The duration of total pre-adult stage was found to decrease with increase in temperature from 60.0 days at 20 degrees C to 15.3 days at 35 degrees C. The oviposition period lasted 58.5, 44.7, 53.2 and 24.5 days at 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively, with females laying an average of 164.8, 415.2, 660.4 and 136.6 eggs, respectively, at these four temperatures. Life table data were analyzed using an age-stage, two-sex life table. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m) = 0.1540 d(-1)), finite rate of increase (lambda = 1.1666 d(-1)) and net reproductive rate (R-0 = 197.9 offspring) were greatest at 30 degrees C. The shortest mean generation time (T = 30.6 days) was recorded at 35 degrees C. These results indicate that N. arcuatus can successfully survive and reproduce at temperatures of around 30 degrees C and has the potential to be an effective biological control agent of N. viridis and other mealybugs in warm regions.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3				1802-8829		WOS:000343664100006

J	Connor, WP; Smith, SG; Andersen, T; Bradbury, SM; Burum, DC; Hockersmith, EE; Schuck, ML; Mendel, GW; Bugert, RM								Postrelease performance of hatchery yearling and subyearling fall Chinook salmon released into the Snake river								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				24	2			545	560		10.1577/M02-161.1				MAY 2004	2004	Two rearing treatments are used at Lyons Ferry Hatchery to produce yearling (age-1) and subyearling (age-0) fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha for supplementing production of wild fish in the Snake River. We compared four indicators of yearling and subyearling postrelease performance, namely, seaward movement, condition factor, growth rate, and survival. A standard rearing treatment was used to grow yearlings slowly for 14 months to sizes of 152-162 mm (mean fork length). A second standard rearing treatment was used to grow medium subyearlings at a moderate rate for 5 months to 84-89 nm. Two modified rearing treatments were used to produce large subyearlings that were grown rapidly to 90-103 mm and small subyearlings that were grown slowly to 70-76 mm. We released yearlings in April and subyearlings in June on the typical supplementation schedule. Seaward movement, condition factor, growth, and survival varied among rearing treatments. Yearlings moved seaward fastest for reasons related to their large size. Yearlings had the lowest postrelease condition factors and growth rates because they were released when temperatures were cool and they moved seaward quickly, spending little time to feed. Yearlings had the highest survival because they were released when the water was cool, they moved seaward quickly, and their large size reduced susceptibility to predation. Small subyearlings moved seaward the slowest because of their small size and slow growth before release. Small subyearlings had the highest postrelease condition factors and highest growth rates because they lingered and were exposed to relatively high temperatures that were favorable for growth. Small subyearlings had the lowest survival because they lingered and were exposed to low flow and warm water for long durations and their small size increased susceptibility to predation. We conclude that fall Chinook salmon performance after release from Lyons Ferry Hatchery is influenced by release date and by rearing treatment effects on size, prerelease growth rate, and postrelease behavior.									25	1	0	0	27	0	28			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000222067500019		
J	Diaz Briz, Luciana; Sanchez, Felisa; Mari, Noemi; Genzano, Gabriel								Seasonal variation of gelatinous plankton consumption by fish in the South-western Atlantic Ocean: a question of strategy								MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH				14	7			739	751		10.1080/17451000.2018.1508847				2018	2018	Gelatinous plankton is an important food resource for several species of fishes in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Some fish depend heavily on these organisms and are specialized to feed on ctenophores, salps and medusae, while others only consume gelatinous plankton occasionally. We hypothesize that consumption of gelatinous plankton by fishes represents an alternative food resource when primary prey are not available during cold periods in the study area. To determine seasonal variations of gelatinous plankton consumption by fishes, data samples were grouped into cold and warm periods. A total of 64,567 stomachs belonging to 106 species of fish were analysed, of which 32,943 (51%) contained food items. Of those containing food items, 2719 (8.2%), from 38 fish species, contained gelatinous items. Fourteen species ingested gelatinous in warm period, nine in cold period, and 15 in both periods. The proportion of stomachs with gelatinous was significantly greater during the cold period. Ctenophores were the most predominant prey in both periods, followed by salps and medusae. Consumption of ctenophores, salps and medusae was unevenly distributed within the area during the different periods. Classification methods (group average sorting utilizing Bray-Curtis similarity measures based on log (X + 1) identified eight areas of consumption. SIMPER (similarity percentages) analyses revealed that nine fish species contributed most to gelatinous plankton consumption. The seasonal and spatial variation of gelatinous consumption by fish would be related to the availability of food in each period. Strategies of gelatinous consumption, including survival, feeding opportunities and prey specialization, are discussed.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1745-1000	1745-1019		WOS:000445875600006

To be a viable biological control agent this carabid must also be amenable to mass culturing. Manipulation of the substrate ensured that eggs were laid in soil capsules, but deposited in peat, facilitating collection and monitoring. Up to 570 eggs per beetle were laid at 20 degrees C. No cannibalism was exhibited at any stage by this species. Larvae were reared intensively in batches and fed ad libitum on live earthworms, eliminating the need for regular feeding and the removal of decaying food. Rearing experiments were undertaken under a number of different temperature regimes. At constant 20 degrees C it was found that growth was arrested in some 2nd instar larvae for long periods. Co-ordinated changes between 2nd and 3rd instar stages were induced by reduction of the temperature to 14 degrees C between days 24-31 from hatching. The complete life cycle, from newly laid egg to adult beetle, could be reduced to less than 110 days. Mortality was greatest at the late 3rd instar and pre-pupal stages, and possible reasons for this are discussed.									21	0	0	0	23	1	24			0013-8959			WOS:A1994RT75300009		
J	Mills, K. L.; Laidig, T.; Ralston, S.; Sydeman, W. J.								Diets of top predators indicate pelagic juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) abundance in the California Current System								FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY				16	3			273	283		10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00429.x				2007	2007	Diets of top predators may be useful indicators to the availability of forage fish in marine ecosystems. Juvenile rockfish (young-of-the-year Sebastes spp.) compose a significant part of the diet for many predators in the central California Current, including chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and several species of marine birds and mammals. Herein, we develop annual indices of juvenile rockfish relative abundance by collating time series data sets on: (i) the proportion of rockfish in the diet of three species of seabirds breeding on Southeast Farallon Island (1975-2002); (ii) the number of rockfish in chinook salmon stomachs (1980-99); and (iii) the abundance of rockfish captured in scientific mid-water trawl net surveys (1983-2002). We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to combine indices, and refer to these as 'Multivariate Rockfish Indices' (MRI). Combining time series verifies the patterns shown by each alone and provides a synoptic perspective on juvenile rockfish relative abundance. The diets of predators with the largest foraging ranges (Common Murre, Uria aalge) and chinook salmon co-varied strongly with the net samples, and appear to be the best indicators. The salmon also sampled species of Sebastes not caught in the nets. The MRI reveals interannual variability in juvenile rockfish abundance, a substantial decline in abundance in the 1990s, and a partial recovery in the early 2000s. Predator-based sampling is a cost-effective enhancement of scientific net sampling.									60	1	0	0	41	0	61			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000245940500006

Although parasite-induced phenotypic variation has been studied extensively in terrestrial and freshwater taxa, this phenomenon remains comparatively under-studied in marine pelagic invertebrates, such as ecologically important jellyfish. Here we studied the parasite-host relationship between Edwardsiella sp. anemone larvae (parasite) and medusae of Aurelia sp. 5 (host) in an isolated marine lake (Veliko Jezero) in Croatia. During 3 different seasons, we quantified differences in the vertical position in the water column, morphology, and egg production between parasitized and unparasitized medusae. Our results revealed that medusa behavior, morphology, and fecundity can be significantly affected by parasitism. Infected medusae were more abundant higher in the water-column where water was warmer, while unparasitized individuals displayed the opposite pattern. In addition, host somatic growth, gonad size, and egg production were negatively affected by parasitism, suggesting an ultimate negative effect on medusa fecundity. Parasitized individuals, however, developed relatively longer manubria and produced larger eggs than unparasitized counterparts, indicating a compensatory response to increase capture surface and reproductive effort. This study demonstrates the extent of parasite-induced phenotypic variation in jellyfish as well as the role of parasites in potential regulation of jellyfish population size.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000365698900007

Which natural enemy represents the greater threat and therefore the stronger selection force on pupation site selection depends upon the time of year, the relative abundance of predators versus parasitoids, and the availability of alternative prey or hosts. Predation by foraging birds and mammals is likely to occur most commonly in winter when leaves have fallen, cocoons are conspicuous, and higher quality prey are scarcer. Inaccessibility and crypsis of pupation sites may provide protection from visually hunting predators. Attacks by parasitic wasps, which take place only during warmer months, may not be as easily avoided by inaccessibility or crypsis. We studied the patterns and mortality risks of pupation site selection in Diprion similis (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae; Introduced Pine Sawfly). Cocoons that were smaller than average and situated in relatively inaccessible sites (thinner branches, underside of branches) were less likely to be attacked by predators; background matching in terms of branch size proved not to improve survival. In contrast, the probability that a cocoon would be attacked by parasitic wasps (primarily Monodontomerus dentipes; Hymenoptera: Torymidae) was unaffected by location along branches, indicating that parasitoids are more difficult to escape through pupation site selection. Because Pine Sawflies were twice as likely to be killed by predators than by parasitoids during the cocoon stage, inaccessibility may be the most important factor for selecting pupation sites.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1092-6194	1938-5307		WOS:000417261200003		
J	Yard, Michael D.; Coggins, Lewis G., Jr.; Baxter, Colden V.; Bennett, Glenn E.; Korman, Josh								Trout Piscivory in the Colorado River, Grand Canyon: Effects of Turbidity, Temperature, and Fish Prey Availability								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				140	2			471	486		10.1080/00028487.2011.572011				MAR 2011	2011	Introductions of nonnative salmonids, such as rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta, have affected native fishes worldwide in unforeseen and undesirable ways. Predation and other interactions with nonnative rainbow trout and brown trout have been hypothesized as contributing to the decline of native fishes (including the endangered humpback chub Gila cypha) in the Colorado River, Grand Canyon. A multiyear study was conducted to remove nonnative fish from a 15-km segment of the Colorado River near the Little Colorado River confluence. We evaluated how sediment, temperature, fish prey availability, and predator abundance influenced the incidence of piscivory (IP) by nonnative salmonids. Study objectives were addressed through spatial (upstream and downstream of the Little Colorado River confluence) and temporal (seasonal and annual) comparisons of prey availability and predator abundance. Data were then evaluated by modeling the quantity of fish prey ingested by trout during the first 2 years (2003-2004) of the mechanical removal period. Field effort resulted in the capture of 20,000 nonnative fish, of which 90% were salmonids. Results indicated that the brown trout IP was higher (8-70%) than the rainbow trout IP (0.5-3.3%); however, rainbow trout were 50 times more abundant than brown trout in the study area. We estimated that during the study period, over 30,000 fish (native and nonnative species combined) were consumed by rainbow trout (21,641 fish) and brown trout (11,797 fish). On average, rainbow trout and brown trout ingested 85% more native fish than nonnative fish in spite of the fact that native fish constituted less than 30% of the small fish available in the study area. Turbidity may mediate piscivory directly by reducing prey detection, but this effect was not apparent in our data, as rainbow trout IP was greater when suspended sediment levels (range = 5.9-20,000 mg/L) were higher.									56	0	0	0	52	0	58			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000289630100019

Burbot larvae (Lota lota) perform a substantial diel vertical migration (DVM) of increasing amplitude in the pelagic zone during a 3-month period before migrating to the littoral zone as early-juveniles. We hypothesised that feeding in the warm surface layers at night and then spending the day in cold water below the thermocline reduces metabolic costs and earns burbot larvae an energetic advantage.2. To test our hypothesis, we mimicked the temperature conditions experienced by vertically migrating burbot in the pelagic zone. We also simulated three further scenarios, in which temperature remained constant.3. Burbot showed the best performance (defined as specific growth rate multiplied by the probability of survival) in the treatments simulating DVM. The high temperature treatment, simulating permanent residence in the warm epilimnion, resulted in high growth combined with high mortality. At a permanently low temperature, simulating life in the hypolimnion, growth was poor and activity reduced.4. In a deep, temperature-stratified lake, where the apparently beneficial overall medium temperature is found in a restricted layer within the thermocline, DVM optimises performance in young burbot. Various ultimate factors might act synergistically in selecting for DVM in larval and early-juvenile burbot.									18	0	0	0	18	1	18			0046-5070			WOS:000289171400010

However, integrative end-to-end ecosystem studies (experimental and/or modelling) are rare. Experimental investigations often concentrate on a particular group or individual species within a trophic level, while tropho-dynamic field studies typically employ either a bottom-up approach concentrating on the phytoplankton community or a top-down approach concentrating on the fish community. Likewise the emphasis within modelling studies is usually placed upon phytoplankton-dominated biogeochemistry or on aspects of fisheries regulation. In consequence the roles of zooplankton communities (protists and metazoans) linking phytoplankton and fish communities are typically under-represented if not (especially in fisheries models) ignored. Where represented in ecosystem models, zooplankton are usually incorporated in an extremely simplistic fashion, using empirical descriptions merging various interacting physiological functions governing zooplankton growth and development, and thence ignoring physiological feedback mechanisms. Here we demonstrate, within a modelled plankton food-web system, how trophic dynamics are sensitive to small changes in parameter values describing zooplankton vital rates and thus the importance of using appropriate zooplankton descriptors. Through a comprehensive review, we reveal the mismatch between empirical understanding and modelling activities identifying important issues that warrant further experimental and modelling investigation. These include: food selectivity, kinetics of prey consumption and interactions with assimilation and growth, form of voided material, mortality rates at different age-stages relative to prior nutrient history. In particular there is a need for dynamic data series in which predator and prey of known nutrient history are studied interacting under varied pH and temperature regimes. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In accordance with the near-shore shunt hypothesis and the actual distribution of mussels, the model predicted a considerable impact of mussels on phytoplankton in nearshore areas (< 15 m depth; -38 % phytoplankton). Horizontal advection could account for the lower (-15 % phytoplankton) offshore impact despite the absence of mussels within this region of the lake. These predictions were similar to observed long-term changes in phytoplankton biomass after the dreissenid mussel invasion. Simulated decreases in the initial mussel biomass by 50 % led to increased phytoplankton nearshore, increased mussel growth and decreased phosphorus excretion relative to ingestion. In contrast, increases in initial mussel biomass by 50 % resulted in minor changes in phytoplankton, since near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton caused growth and energy-limitation of mussels. The model, which was the first to capture metabolically-driven variations of mussel-mediated nutrient cycling, predicted a partial uncoupling of carbon and phosphorus cycling by mussels, driven by varying controls on mussel growth. A 60 % increase in the intensity of three storms during the summer had little net-effect on phytoplankton biomass, but reduced energy-limitation of mussels and increased mussel growth due to increased supply of phytoplankton. Our model demonstrates that near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton is an important process limiting the impact of mussels, and indicates that it affects the mussels' cycling of energy and nutrients. It further suggests that stronger storm events could lead to further increase of flux of organic matter from the pelagic zone to the benthos, further altering energy pathways in the lake.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			1015-1621	1420-9055		WOS:000347149700009

We used a liner regression model to analyze the relationship between standard length (SL) and age (in days). The slope of growth model was significant difference between regions. There were rapid increases in the otolith mean daily increment width of juveniles at 7 days after hatching (DAH) and 10 DAH in the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WARM) and North Pacific Tropical Gyre area (NPTG), respectively. These periods correspond to the timing at which larvae complete their digestive-system development and start the piscivory. We found significant difference in logarithmic back-calculated SL between WARM and NPTG at 3 DAH (p < 0.01). Mean growth rates until 10 DAH, when the larvae metamorphose into juveniles, were positively correlated with sea surface temperature (r = 0.52). These results indicate that geographic difference in the growth of juvenile skipjack tuna caught in the WCPO in boreal winter cause in the larval stage, and that these differences are related to sea surface temperature.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000426090300006

To predict the consequences of increased invasiveness, a field experiment was completed over a summer period using a Control comprising of an assemblage of native fishes of known starting abundance and a Treatment using the same assemblage but with elevated L. gibbosus densities. The trophic consequences of L. gibbosus invasion were assessed with stable isotope analysis and associated metrics including the isotopic niche, measured as standard ellipse area. The isotopic niches of native gudgeon Gobio gobio and roach Rutilus rutilus overlapped substantially with that of non-native L. gibbosus, and were also substantially reduced in size compared to ponds where L. gibbosus were absent. This suggests these native fishes shifted to a more specialized diet in L. gibbosus presence. Both of these native fishes also demonstrated a concomitant and significant reduction in their trophic position in L. gibbosus presence, with a significant decrease also evident in the somatic growth rate and body condition of G. gobio. Thus, there were marked changes detected in the isotopic ecology and growth rates of the native fish in the presence of non-native L. gibbosus. The implications of these results for present and future invaded pond communities are discussed.									19	0	0	0	16	0	19			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000392187700004		
J	Heck, KL; Coen, LD; Wilson, DM								Growth of northern [Mercenaria mercenaria (L.)] and southern [M-campechiensis (Gmelin)] quahogs: Influence of seagrasses and latitude								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				21	2			635	642						DEC 2002	2002	To better understand how seagrasses influence the growth of northern and southern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria and Mercenaria campechiensis), we collected and compared the growth rates of clams from seagrasses and adjacent unvegetated locations along the Atlantic (Massachusetts and New Jersey) and Gulf of Mexico coasts (Alabama and Florida) using identical methods.' In particular, we sought to test hypotheses that clam growth is influenced not only by the presence or absence of seagrass (Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, and Zostera marina), but also by location within seagrass beds. Walford plots constructed using annual shell-growth band analyses showed that Mercenaria spp. growth was significantly affected by the presence of seagrass habitat, although the magnitude of this effect varied with clam age (size) and latitude. Specifically, first-year growth was significantly greater in unvegetated than in adjacent vegetated sites, whereas a measure of lifelong growth (Ford's growth coefficient) was not significantly different between adjacent vegetated and unvegetated sites. We hypothesize that these conflicting results may be due, in part, to differing patterns of energy resource allocation in Mercenaria at various life cycle stages. During the first 1.5 y or so, a clam's energy resources are allocated primarily to somatic growth, whereas in subsequent years energy is also allocated to reproduction. Therefore, factors affecting Mercenaria growth, such as the presence or absence of submerged vegetation, should be most easily detectable in analyses examining the first year's growth. Even though our data showed greater first-year growth at lower latitudes (Gulf of Mexico sites versus New Jersey and Massachusetts), overall lifelong growth rates were greatest at the Massachusetts sites. We attribute this pattern to the fact that higher first-year growth rates quickly become asymptotic in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, whereas slower but more constant growth rates are typical of clams from colder water sites. We found little evidence for the effects of location (as measured as distance from bed edge) on growth of individuals collected from grassbeds, except where patterns of water movement showed consistent directionality (e.g., Gulf of Mexico sites). Given the multitude of variables that can interact to influence clam growth rates and the unresolved variability in results from single-site studies performed in different locations, some complex, carefully controlled experiments are still needed to elucidate the dominant factors that regulate both short and long-term clam growth.									8	0	0	0	9	0	9			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000180576400030		
J	Nagano, Mariko; Doi, Hideyuki					Doi, Hideyuki/0000-0002-2701-3982			Degree of high phenotypic plasticity in wild populations of Daphnia in early spring								JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY				77	2			309	315		10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1709				2018	2018	Inducible defenses have been empirically known as defensive phenotypes that are triggered by predator kairomones. We hypothesized that morphological defense of wild Daphnia varies not only with predator density. but also with the predator regime in the field. We observed how the morphological defenses of two Daphnia species (D. ambigua and a pules) changed according to the population density in the water column at daytime of predatory insect larvae ChaoborusJim:jeans in Lake Fukami-ike, Japan, from February to July. In both Daphnia species, the inducible defense morphology was highly expressed in March and April. Its degree of expression decreased. and did not change with increases in predator density from May to July. These seasons are generally considered as when the number of the larvae and fish increases. and predation becomes more active due to their growth and breeding. We suggest that the degree of inducible defense of Daphnia is higher at the end of the overwintering season. when Chaoborus larvae began to inhabit the water column during the daytime and is constant in other seasons regardless of predators' regime changes. Field observation of wild populations is important for understanding the seasonal changes in the morphology and to provide more realistic explanations of phenomena in inducible defense.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1129-5767	1723-8633		WOS:000456091500014

Daily weight specific growth rate (SGR) of copepod developmental stages (N6 to female) was measured monthly between September and March 1993/94 and 1994/95. Seasonally, SGRs of small stages (N6 to C2) remained relatively constant. By contrast, SGRs of large stages (C3 to female) mirrored changes in chl a related to seasonal warming and wind patterns, with a moderate peak in September/October and a larger peak in January to March. Superimposed on this seasonal cycle were fluctuations in response to winds on the event scale. At the onset of upwelling, mean female SGR across the shelf was slow. During sustained upwelling, female SGR increased, with a peak associated with enhanced chl a in the upwelling front and slower rates inshore in newly upwelled water and offshore in oligotrophic water. Female SGR was fastest during prolonged quiescence when high chl a levels extended over most of the shelf. During downwelling, female SGRs decreased. again, with fastest rates inshore. Overall, SGRs were not related to temperature, but were related to chl a, with stronger relationships for larger stages. This suggested food limitation of larger stages, which may be a consequence of their preference for larger phytoplankton cells that only occur at high concentrations in restricted locations in time and space in the southern Benguela upwelling system. The spawning of sardine varied seasonally and coincided with the maximum chl a concentration and production of C. agulhensis eggs (daily egg production x female density), both of which are a good source of food for fish larvae. Thus the timing of sardine spawning maximizes the food available to their larvae.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000183887600021

ANIMAL COGNITION				14	6			809	816		10.1007/s10071-011-0414-5				NOV 2011	2011	Despite the fact that the ability of animals to avoid being consumed by predators is influenced by their behaviour, morphology and life history, very few studies have attempted to integrate prey responses across these adaptation types. Here, our goal was to address the link between life-history traits (size and growth trajectory) of tadpoles and behavioural responses to predators. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether information learned about predators was influenced by prey growth trajectory before and after learning. We manipulated the size/growth trajectory of tadpoles by raising them under different temperatures. Tadpoles raised on a slow-growth trajectory (under cold conditions) and taught to recognize a salamander subsequently showed stronger responses after 2 weeks than tadpoles that were raised on a fast-growth trajectory (under warm conditions). When we account for the effect of size (r(2) = 0.22) on the responses of prey to predator cues, we find that the growth trajectory pre-learning but not post-learning influences the learned responses of the tadpoles. The differences in responses to predators may reflect differential memory associated with the predator. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has attempted to link life-history traits (size and growth rate) with learning of predators. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of antipredator responses of prey animals, we call for additional integrative studies that examine prey antipredator responses across adaptation types.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1435-9448			WOS:000300088600004	21556704

In southern Africa, sugarcane production has converted native vegetation into agricultural monocultures. We examined functional group abundance along a conservation-agriculture gradient in the Lowveld of Swaziland. We captured small mammals representing 4 functional groups: omnivores, insectivores, granivores, and herbivores and found evidence of distinct changes in small mammal functional groups across the conservation-agriculture boundary. Granivores declined with increasing distance into the sugarcane and were completely absent at 375 m from the boundary while omnivores increased in the sugarcane. Insectivores and herbivores showed no differences between the two land uses; however, during the dry season, there were significantly more insectivores at the conservation-agriculture interface than in the conservation lands. Shifts in small mammal communities have clear implications for ecosystem processes as the removal of granivores from savannah systems can drastically alter vegetative structure and potentially lead to shrub encroachment via reduced levels of seed predation, while abundant omnivorous small mammals can cause significant crop damage and increase the prevalence of vector borne diseases in the environment.

B. glaciale constituted a majority of the deep scattering layer (DSL), which was located between 300 and 650 m during daylight hours; at night, a part of the DSL migrated to the surface. B. glaciale is a zooplanktivore, feeding primarily on copepods (Calanus hyperboreus, Pareuchaeta norvegica, Metridia longa and Calanus finmarchicus), followed by amphipods (Themisto compressa) and krill (primarily Nematoscelis spp.). Although crustaceans dominated the diet, other invertebrates, such as chaetognaths, gastropods, polychaetes, ostracods and appendicularians, also contributed. The geographical differences in the composition of the diet resulted from the association of prey with distinct water masses. In the colder water at the north of the bank, Arctic species represented a higher proportion of the diet, but this situation was reversed in areas influenced by the warmer water from the south. B. glaciale fed more intensively towards the centre of the Flemish Cap. The diet of B. glaciale shifted ontogenetically, showing increasing prey size and prey diversity with increasing predator size.									5	0	0	0	4	0	6			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000323660900010

Trophic Feasibility of Reintroducing Anadromous Salmonids in Three Reservoirs on the North Fork Lewis River, Washington: Prey Supply and Consumption Demand of Resident Fishes								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				145	6			1331	1347		10.1080/00028487.2016.1219678				2016	2016	The reintroduction of anadromous salmonids in reservoirs is being proposed with increasing frequency, requiring baseline studies to evaluate feasibility and estimate the capacity of reservoir food webs to support reintroduced populations. Using three reservoirs on the north fork Lewis River as a case study, we demonstrate a method to determine juvenile salmonid smolt rearing capacities for lakes and reservoirs. To determine if the Lewis River reservoirs can support reintroduced populations of juvenile stream-type Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, we evaluated the monthly production of daphnia Daphnia spp. (the primary zooplankton consumed by resident salmonids in the system) and used bioenergetics to model the consumption demand of resident fishes in each reservoir. To estimate the surplus of Daphnia prey available for reintroduced salmonids, we assumed a maximum sustainable exploitation rate and accounted for the consumption demand of resident fishes. The number of smolts that could have been supported was estimated by dividing any surplus Daphnia production by the simulated consumption demand of an individual Chinook Salmon fry rearing in the reservoir to successful smolt size. In all three reservoirs, densities of Daphnia were highest in the epilimnion, but warm epilimnetic temperatures and the vertical distribution of planktivores suggested that access to abundant epilimnetic prey was limited. By comparing accessible prey supply and demand on a monthly basis, we were able to identify potential prey supply bottlenecks that could limit smolt production and growth. These results demonstrate that a bioenergetics approach can be a valuable method of examining constraints on lake and reservoir rearing capacity, such as thermal structure and temporal food supply. This method enables numerical estimation of rearing capacity, which is a useful metric for managers evaluating the feasibility of reintroducing Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in lentic systems.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000387600000016

Methods of laboratory evaluation included predation trials at different larval mosquito densities, population growth rates at different temperatures, and laboratory cage simulations. The predation efficacy of Mesocyclops aspericornis, M. australiensis, and M. mb1 from southern Queensland, and M. darwini, M. mb2, M. notius and M. mb3 from northern Queensland were compared with M. aspericornis (used successfully in French Polynesia) against laboratory populations of Aedes aegypti (L.), Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Anopheles farauti Laveran (No. 1). M. aspericornis (L. Kurwongbah) proved to be the most effective Queensland predator and exhibited an elevated reproductive rate at 20-25-degrees-C. M. darwini was less efficient as a predator but was more fecund at 25-35-degrees-C. Based on these evaluations, M. aspericornis (L. Kurwongbah) has been selected for small-scale field trials in Queensland.									43	0	0	0	34	3	45			0022-2585			WOS:A1991GG44800010	1941928

Movements powered by elastic recoil, however, are known to be more thermally robust than muscle-powered movements. We examined the whole-organism performance, motor control and muscle contractile physiology underlying feeding in the salamander Eurycea guttolineata. We compared elastically powered tongue projection with the associated muscle-powered retraction to determine the thermal robustness of each of these functional levels. We found that tongue-projection distance in E. guttolineata was unaffected by temperature across the entire 4-26 degrees C range, tongue-projection dynamics were significantly affected by temperature across only the 4-11 degrees C interval, and tongue retraction was affected to a higher degree across the entire temperature range. The significant effect of temperature on projection dynamics across the 4-11 degrees C interval corresponds to a significant decline in projector muscle burst intensity and peak contractile force of the projector muscle across the same interval. Across the remaining temperature range, however, projection dynamics were unaffected by temperature, with muscle contractile physiology showing typical thermal effects and motor patterns showing increased activity durations and latencies. These results reveal that elastically powered tongue-projection performance in E. guttolineata is maintained to a higher degree than muscle-powered tongue retraction performance across a wide temperature range. These results further indicate that thermal robustness of the elastically powered movement is dependent on motor control and muscle physiology that results in comparable energy being stored in elastic tissues across a range of temperatures.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000342505700026	24948633

Two independent, yet complementary time series, CalCOFI ichthyoplankton surveys and sampling of southern California power plant cooling-water intakes, have indicated that an assemblage of predominantly cool-water affinity fishes spanning nearshore to oceanic environments in the southern CCS has declined dramatically from the 1970s to the 2000s. We examined potential oceanographic drivers behind this decline both within and north of the CalCOFI survey area in order to capture upstream processes as well. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses using output from a data-assimilative regional ocean model revealed significant relationships between the fish time series and spatial patterns of upwelling, upper ocean heat content and eddy kinetic energy in the CCS. Correlation and linear regression analyses indicated that the declining trend in fish abundance was correlated with a suite of factors: reduced offshore and increased inshore upwelling; a long term warming trend combined with more recent interannual variability in ocean temperature; weaker eddy kinetic energy north of Point Conception (35 degrees N), potentially indicating reduced transport of the California Current (CC); increased influence of the California Undercurrent (CUC); and a decline in zooplankton displacement volume across the southern CCS. Understanding how changes in oceanography affect fish populations will offer insights into managing fisheries in a changing climate.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000440920600007

Larvae of Chrysoperla externa (Hagen, 1861) (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) were observed feeding voraciously on these aphid colonies. In order to evaluate their potential as biological control agents, some biological parameters and their consumption capacity were studied in laboratory. Ten larvae were isolated in plastic vials and fed with aphids of small size (nymphs of 1st and 2nd instars) and 10 with aphids of medium size (nymphs of 3rd and 4th instars), maintained at 15ºC, 20ºC and 25ºC, under 12:12 h photoperiod and 70 ± 10% RH, and observed daily. The egg incubation period was nine days at 20ºC and four days at 25ºC. The mean larval development period for C. externa was 59.5 days; 22.3 days and 10.9 days, respectively at 15ºC, 20ºC and 25ºC. The pupal stage last 23.2 at 20ºC and 11.1 days at 25ºC. Unfortunately, data of egg and pupal development at 15ºC are not available because the rearing chamber overheated. The mortality rate from egg to adult was 46.2% 46.6% and 20.2% at 15ºC, 20ºC and 25ºC, respectively. The average aphid consumption of each C. externa larva to complete its development was 499.1; 341.7 and 215.1 small aphids, and 126.4; 105.6 and 67.0 medium aphids, at 15ºC, 20ºC and 25ºC, respectively. About 80% of the total food consumption was by the 3rd instar larvae. Although the development was faster and viability higher at 25ºC than at the other two temperatures, the consumption was the highest at 15ºC because the larval period was much longer. Therefore, the larvae of C. externa can be regarded as potential biological control agents of Cinara spp. throughout the year and even in cool areas of Southern Brazil during some periods o the year.									8	0	0	0	7	5	10			0101-8175			SCIELO:S0101-81752003000400002

In this study, we used a multi-proxy approach to determine the relative importance of in-lake versus indirect processes on the Holocene development of an oligotrophic lake in SW Greenland (66.99 degrees N, 50.97 degrees W). A C-14 and Pb-210-dated sediment core covering approximately 8500 years BP was analyzed for organic-inorganic carbon content, pigments, diatoms, chironomids, cladocerans, and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18). Relationships among the different proxies and a number of independent controlling variables (Holocene temperature, an isotope-inferred cooling period, and immigration of Betula nana into the catchment) were explored using redundancy analysis (RDA) independent of time. The main ecological trajectories in the lake biota were captured by ordination first axis sample scores (18-32% variance explained). The importance of the arrival of Betula (ca. 6500 years BP) into the catchment was indicated by a series of partial-constrained ordinations, uniquely explaining 12-17% of the variance in chironomids and up to 9% in pigments. Climate influences on lake biota were strongest during a short-lived cooling period (identified by altered stable isotopes) early in the development of the lake when all proxies changed rapidly, although only chironomids had a unique component (8% in a partial-RDA) explained by the cooling event. Holocene climate explained less variance than either catchment changes or biotic relationships. The sediment record at this site indicates the importance of catchment factors for lake development, the complexity of community trends even in relatively simple systems (invertebrates are the top predators in the lake) and the challenges of deriving palaeoclimate inferences from sediment records in low-Arctic freshwater lakes.									76	4	0	0	53	0	81			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000254235500009

FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY				190	3			213	220		10.1127/fal/2017/0989				AUG 2017	2017	Many planktonic invertebrates avoid illuminated water layers where the risk of visual detection by predators is highest, which explains why they move to deeper lake layers during daylight hours. At night, individuals migrate upward, back to warm layers at the surface, which are rich in food. Animals migrating in thermally-stratified lakes and, thus, crossing the thermal gradient twice a day are exposed to various negative factors, including diel changes in experienced temperature. Thermal stress would also be experienced by animals inhabiting very small water bodies that are subject to rapid heating by the sun during the day and cooling at night, or those inhabiting thermally-polluted lakes. In laboratory experiments, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the growth rate in Daphnia magna originating from various clones exposed to diel temperature fluctuations, such as those experienced during vertical migration. In addition, the levels of heat shock proteins (HSP70) are significantly reduced following a rapid change in temperature. We also find that a slow temperature change, such as that potentially experienced by animals that are either slowly migrating or avoiding intensely heated locations, is less costly for Daphnia than a fast temperature change.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1863-9135			WOS:000412040000005		
J	Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo								Spatial variation in reproductive measures of female bluegill Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque in a small lake with diverse thermal conditions								ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES				52						19	10.1186/1810-522X-52-19				SEP 2013	2013	Background: Our previous studies have revealed that bluegill Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque in Lake Biwa exhibit spatial variations in growth, maturation, and reproduction. The topographical characteristics of Lake Biwa produce a wide range of thermal conditions, which seem to be responsible for those findings. Despite its small size, Lake Yogo is characterized by diverse thermal conditions owing to the presence of a small, shallow pool in the northern part of the lake and the inflow of water from Lake Biwa into the southern part of the lake. Whether bluegill in such a small lake also exhibit spatially varying physiological activity remains uncertain.Results: The maturation status of female bluegill in Lake Yogo was investigated from late April to early June 2011 and in late May 2012. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) of the fish in the pool significantly exceeded those in the main lake in late April and mid-May 2011 before the onset of spawning. The spawning of bluegill had probably already begun by late May 2012, and the fish in the pool and along the northwestern edge of the lake had smaller GSIs than did the fish in the southern part of the lake. The relationship between oocyte diameter and GSI could be described by a saturation function. The plot of GSI/oocyte diameter vs. GSI did not vary significantly among the sites.Conclusions: The maturation status of bluegill varied among sites in Lake Yogo, likely to be due to the diverse thermal conditions of the lake. Higher temperatures in the pool during the prespawning season favored the rapid maturation of ovaries of the fish therein. The inflowing colder water from Lake Biwa seemed to be responsible for delayed ovary maturation and, thereby, the delay in the spawning season of bluegill in the southern part of the lake.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1021-5506	1810-522X		WOS:000326870000012

Colony growth (weight), photosynthetic efficiency (maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII, F-v/F-m [where PSII is Photosystem II, F-v variable fluorescence and F-m maximum fluorescence yield in the dark]), and the healing of lesions were measured during 2 replicate 10 d trials. Injury caused growth to increase in 3 of 4 treatments: high flow, high temperature; low flow, high temperature; and low flow, low temperature. However, growth was greatest for uninjured corals in the high-flow, low temperature treatment, which appears to provide optimal conditions for P. verrucosa (when not injured). Temperature alone had little effect on growth but influenced F-v/F-m, as did flow; F-v/F-m was 5% greater at 26.6 degrees C than 29.6 degrees C, and 3% higher at 21 cm s(-1) than 6 cm s(-1). Injury had little effect on F-v/F-m, and neither temperature nor flow affected the rate of healing that occurred at 17 to 25% of the lesion area in 10 d. Results from a field experiment, in which growth of P. verrucosa was tested as a function of flow speed (similar to 14 cm s(-1) versus similar to 3 cm s(-1)) and fish predation (predators versus no predators), but not temperature, supported results of the microcosm experiment. Growth was greatest for corals in the high-flow, no predator treatment, and relatively high for injured corals in low flow. Together, these results suggest that P. verrucosa, a common branching coral, prioritizes overall growth over repair when injured by fish feeding, which differs from the outcome observed in a companion study in which juvenile colonies of massive Porites were subjected to similar injuries.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000279054000005

Aphids established at low densities and BYV was spread in circular patches around the infested plants at all sites. The number of diseased plants per patch at the end of September ranged from a field-average of 130 to 210 in the four fields. There was a weak tendency towards better aphid establishment and greater virus spread in fields in less complex landscapes. Edge sites had less virus spread than interior sites in one field, more virus spread in two other fields, and then was no statistically significant difference in the fourth field.In the field where virus spread was lowest at edge sites, we used predator exclosure and direct observation to manipulate and quantify the effects of early season predation. On a warm day in early June, 81% of Aphis fabae exposed to predators on young beet plants disappeared during a 24 h period, compared to 10% of aphids protected by clipcages. Intermediate levels of predator exclusion, allowing aphids to walk away but restricting predator access, showed that predation was responsible for aphid disappearance. Cantharis lateralis L. (Coleoptera: Cantharidae) was the most frequently observed foliar predator (> 90%). It was found eating aphids on several occasions. The incidence of predators was 1.8 per plant per h in the field interior and 3.8 per plant per h. near the edge.In the same field, aphids and virus were released in six edge and six interior sites, that were surrounded by 0.5 m high plastic open-top barriers ('exclosures'). Pitfall trapping inside the barriers reduced potential soil predator densities to ca. one-tenth of the open field level and arrivals of flying predators were reduced. Inside the exclosures, aphid establishment was enhanced, and virus spread at exclosure sites was increased by about 50% compared to open sites.Foliar and pitfall sampling yielded the following predators: Cantharis lateralis, C. rufa L. (Coleoptera: Cantharidae), Coccinella septempunctata L., C. undecimpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Pterostichus cupreus (L.), Harpalus rufipes (de Geer), Patrobus atrorufus (Strom), Trechus quadristriatus (Schrk.), Bembidion lampros (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Carabidae). In a laboratory no-choice trial (with 10 M. persicae /day offered), each of these species ate aphids with consumption rates varying from 1.7 to 9.2 aphids/day.The results show that early predation substantially impacted aphid establishment in one held, and resulted in reduced virus spread. Results in the other fields show that these results cannot be easily generalized.									84	4	0	0	79	0	88			0013-8959			WOS:000072987000006

We selected 3 species that exhibit such boom and bust dynamics in spinifex grassland in the Simpson Desert, central Australia, and asked how they survive prolonged dry periods when they are scarce or absent from the trapping record. We postulated that animals persist by retreating to small patches of open woodland that are embedded within the grassland matrix and predicted that these patches would provide more food and shelter for small mammals than the surrounding grassland during dry periods but not at other times. We also predicted that capture rates and activity of the study species would be higher, and risk of predation lower, in the woodland than in the grassland during drought, and that after heavy rain the rate of return of small mammals to spinifex grassland would be correlated with proximity to patches of woodland. Sampling provided partial support for these predictions. Some food resources (seeds) were more abundant in woodland patches irrespective of environmental conditions, but others (invertebrates) showed no clear pattern; shelter resources were mostly invariant between habitats and times. Of the 3 study species, only the sandy inland mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis) behaved largely as we had anticipated, but even this species was not confined to woodland during droughts. Both the spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis) and brush-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus blythi) continued to use grassland more than woodland during drought and nondrought periods, although N. alexis showed a tendency to increase its activity in woodland during dry conditions. Trappability remained relatively constant among species, habitats, and times, indicating that the temporal patterns of habitat use we uncovered were real and not artifacts of changes in animal behavior or susceptibility to capture. We conclude that woodland patches contribute importantly to the persistence of P. hermannsburgensis during droughts, whereas N. alexis and D. blythi either use other unidentified refugia at such times or occur at such low densities in grassland habitat that their chances of being captured are very small.									60	2	0	0	57	1	62			0022-2372	1545-1542		WOS:000298490800004

Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020	Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003			Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) abundance and growth in a subtropical embayment: evidence from 7 years of standardized fishing effort								MARINE BIOLOGY				149	4			961	968		10.1007/s00227-006-0278-4				JUL 2006	2006	The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and Lesueur 1822) is a widely distributed predator with a broad diet and the potential to affect marine community structure, yet information on local patterns of abundance for this species is lacking. Tiger shark catch data were gathered over 7 years of tag and release research fishing (1991-2000, 2002-2004) in Shark Bay, Western Australia (25 degrees 45'S, 113 degrees 44'E). Sharks were caught using drumlines deployed in six permanent zones (similar to 3 km(2) in area). Fishing effort was standardized across days and months, and catch rates on hooks were expressed as the number of sharks caught h(-1) stop. A total of 449 individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm season (Sep-May) than during the cold season (Jun-Aug), and was marked by inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded those for populations elsewhere for sharks > 275 cm fork length (FL), perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large prey. The data suggest that (1) the threat of predation faced by animals consumed by tiger sharks fluctuates dramatically within and between years, and (2) efforts to monitor large shark abundance should be extensive enough to detect inter-annual variation and sufficiently intensive to account for intra-annual trends.									54	0	0	0	52	1	56			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000238683900023

Spawning areas could be predicted with good discrimination for anchovy, as indicated by logistic models with an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC; i.e. probability of concordance) of 0.86, and acceptable discrimination for sardine, as indicated by an AUC of 0.79. Knowledge of 3-dimensional characteristics of the water column was particularly important for predicting anchovy spawning habitat, as indicated by 2 variables: depth at which maximum chlorophyll a (chl a) occurred and an index of geostrophic flow. These variables were not useful predictors in the sardine model. For both species, variables related to low productivity limited modeled spawning probability most frequently during the 1980s and 1990s, but low temperature was most frequently limiting during the 2000s. Egg abundance was extremely patchy for both species; models to predict numbers of eggs conditional on their presence had almost no additional predictive ability for either species. However, most eggs occurred in areas where predicted probabilities of egg presence were relatively high. About 80% of anchovy eggs were captured in 40% of the samples that had modeled capture probabilities >= 0.25. About 80% of sardine eggs were captured in 35% of the samples that had predicted probabilities of capture >= 0.25. These models may be useful for understanding interannual changes in populations of predators that depend on anchovies and sardine. They could also improve the precision of fisheries surveys if predictors were collected beforehand using unmanned gliders.									40	0	0	0	31	0	40			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000278441200020

In the north-east 'Pacific, one example of this is periodic warming episodes. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that krill (Euphausia pacifica Hansen), which is a centrally important species in coastal-upwelling systems, can survive periods of abnormally high temperatures by shrinkage between molts, even if food is plentiful. In addition, we demonstrate that there is a high amount of individual variation in growth rates of krill. Krill are centrally important within pelagic foodwebs both worldwide and within the north-east Pacific, thus we explore the potential ecological consequences of such shrinkage for both krill and their predators.									39	0	0	0	33	1	41			1461-023X			WOS:000083017700011

In fish, environmental conditions are known to affect early survival and growth, but recent studies have also emphasized maternal effects mediated by size or age. However, the relative sensitivity of the mean fitness (population growth rate ) to different early life impacts remains largely unexplored. Using a female-based integral projection model (IPM) parameterized from unique long-term demographic data for pike (Esox lucius), we evaluated the relative fitness consequences of different early life impacts, including (i) maternal effects of length on egg weight, potentially affecting offspring (first year) survival, and (ii) effects of temperature on offspring growth and survival. Of the seven vital rates defining the model, offspring survival could not be directly estimated and four scenarios were defined for this rate. Elasticity analyses of the IPM were performed to calculate (i) the total contribution from different lengths to the elasticity of to the projection kernel, and (ii) the elasticity of to underlying variables of female current length, female offspring length at age 1, and temperature. These elasticities were decomposed into contributions from different vital rates across length. Egg weight increased with female length, as expected, but the effect leveled off for the largest females. However, was largely insensitive to this effect, even when egg weight was assumed to have a strong effect on offspring survival. In contrast, was sensitive to early temperature conditions through growth and survival. Among mature females, the total elasticity of to the projection kernel generally increased with length. The results were robust to a wide range of assumptions. These results suggest that environmental conditions experienced in early life represent a more important driver of mean population growth and fitness of pike than maternal effects of size on offspring survival. We discuss two general mechanisms underlying the weak influence of this maternal effect, suggesting that these may be general for long-lived and highly fecund fishes. This model and results are relevant for the management of long-lived top predators, including many commercially important fish species.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000375121400011	26781671

Study area was located in central Poland, in Lodz voivodship, in the area of Rogow Forest District. It comprised of a mosaic of forests and arable lands. The study was done in the years 2003-2010. Pellets were collected at least twice a year in 18 tawny owl territories. Material collected between April and September was categorised as coming from spring-summer, while this from October-March period as autumn-winter season. Simultaneously, in the years 2004-2007, changes in the number of small rodents were monitored by live-trapping. Standard procedures of pellet analyses were used to identify 1926 prey items. Generally, diet composition was dominated by small rodents. Yet, their share was significantly higher in autumn-winter season (71.3 vs. 57.3%). Among rodents, yellow-necked mice, common voles and bank voles were caught most often. Soricomorphs accounted for 3% of prey items in both seasons on average. Birds formed approximately 15% of prey items and their share was comparable in warm and cold half year. On the other hand, in a warmer period owls preyed on invertebrates more often (23.0 vs. 7.5%). A breadth niche was wider in a warm (D=4.01) half year than in cold one (D=3.36). When a peak of rodent number was recorded, owls preyed on bank voles twice as often as compared to other years (increase from 6.4 to 11% of prey items), while an increase in the consumption of yellow-necked mouse was lower (from 27.5 to 34.2%). Tawny owls preferred yellow-necked mice and bank voles were avoided. This study showed that in the Rogow Forest tawny owl is an opportunistic predator. However, composition of its diet does not absolutely reflect the structure of assemblage of small mammals as certain species are preferred.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0039-7660			WOS:000370207900007

Amongst specialists, nomadic predators present conservation biologists with many challenges, mainly because of the difficulty of studying highly mobile individuals over time and across very large areas. For these species, the relative influence of prey abundance, habitat heterogeneity and arrival time at the breeding grounds on breeding parameters remains poorly understood. We studied the factors influencing variation in breeding numbers and performance of a declining nomadic specialist raptor, the Pallid Harrier , in north-central Kazakhstan. During a 5-year period, we recorded large inter-annual variation in vole abundance in the main study area, and differences between habitats. We also recorded a strong numerical response of breeding Pallid Harriers to inter-annual changes in local vole abundance. From a 13-year dataset on breeding harriers in the same area, harrier numbers appeared to vary cyclically, with an interval between peaks of approximately 6 years. At a broader, regional scale, variations in Pallid Harrier abundance appeared asynchronous, suggesting a regional redistribution of harriers between years. Reproductive success depended on local vole abundance, but also on timing of breeding and nesting habitat. Clutch size, nest success and fledged brood size increased with vole abundance. Late breeders had smaller clutches and apparently lower hatching rates than early ones, possibly as a result of the interplay between their probable poorer body condition and habitat-specific variation in predation rates. In true nomadic specialist predators, such as Pallid Harriers, breeding success may therefore depend on a complex interplay between spatial variation in prey abundance, habitat composition and timing of breeding attempts. One of the factors influencing the start of breeding is the length of time taken to prospect between different breeding sites, which in turn may depend on the predictability of spatial and temporal variation in vole abundance. These results have important conservation implications, as changes in climate and habitat could affect spatial and temporal variations in vole abundance, with possible consequences for timing of breeding, food availability and, ultimately, the reproductive success of this declining nomadic predator.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000304171900010

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				217	9			1563	1569		10.1242/jeb.097816				MAY 2014	2014	Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by Argiope aurantia, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, A. aurantia thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.									25	0	0	0	22	0	25			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000335583500026	24501134

We sampled a population of Alaska Blackfish during the winter months in an upland pond near Fairbanks, Alaska, and we used a simple mark-recapture estimator to provide the first population estimate for this species. We found that Alaska Blackfish density in the pond was approximately 0.27individuals/m(2), equating to an estimated biomass of 15g/m(2) of pond surface area, which is similar to density estimates reported for other mudminnow species. We tested capture methods and found that under-ice minnow trapping was a poor method during early winter (September-December) but was highly effective near methane sumps and areas of high muskrat Ondatra zibethicus activity in late winter (March-April). Qualitatively, nearshore minnow trapping, seining, and kicknetting during the ice-free season were less effective than under-ice trapping. Cursorily, pelvic fin clips were more effective for batch marking of Alaska Blackfish than two types of subcutaneous tags, given the high numbers of individuals we captured and the species' relatively small body size and dark skin, which hindered tag visualization. We demonstrated that Alaska Blackfish can occur at high densities in their typical habitat, underscoring their importance as forage fish in Alaskan freshwater ecosystems that support subsistence and sport fisheries for piscivorous fishes. Extending this approach across the geographic range of Alaska Blackfish will improve understanding of the ecological role of this species in the varying aquatic ecosystems where it occurs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000430674400018

"Vulnerability to harvest varies among individuals within species according to behavioural phenotypes, but we lack fundamental information regarding the physiological mechanisms underlying harvest-induced selection. It is unknown, for example, what physiological traits make some individual fish more susceptible to capture by commercial fisheries. Active fishing methods such as trawling pursue fish during harvest attempts, causing fish to use both aerobic steady-state swimming and anaerobic burst-type swimming to evade capture. Using simulated trawling procedures with schools of wild minnows Phoxinus phoxinus, we investigate two key questions to the study of fisheries-induced evolution that have been impossible to address using large-scale trawls: (i) are some individuals within a fish shoal consistently more susceptible to capture by trawling than others?; and (ii) if so, is this related to individual differences in swimming performance and metabolism? Results provide the first evidence of repeatable variation in susceptibility to trawling that is strongly related to anaerobic capacity and swimming ability. Maximum aerobic swim speed was also negatively correlated with vulnerability to trawling. Standard metabolic rate was highest among fish that were least vulnerable to trawling, but this relationship probably arose through correlations with anaerobic capacity. These results indicate that vulnerability to trawling is linked to anaerobic swimming performance and metabolic demand, drawing parallels with factors influencing susceptibility to natural predators. Selection on these traits by fisheries could induce shifts in the fundamental physiological makeup and function of descendent populations.									27	0	0	0	27	0	28			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000362050000019	26246542

Relative body condition (the quantity of stored energy) is an important tool in understanding demographic variation and the ability of a population to respond to environmental stressors, varying food availability and competition.2. A high-resolution database was used to examine causes of variation in the condition of north-east Arctic cod (Gadus morhua L.) for the period 1967-2004, over annual and monthly timescales. Community dynamics and climate variation were also tested as potential causes.3. Temperature was shown to have a positive impact on condition at both inter- and intra-annual timescales. Interannually, temperature may affect stock distribution, in particular its overlap with the capelin stock. At shorter timescales it is likely that temperature directly affects the metabolism of the cod.4. Intra-annually, the quantity of capelin in cod stomachs positively affected cod condition in the current and the preceding month for all lengths of cod. This indicated a time lag between a change in food consumption and a subsequent change in condition, or 'latency'.5. Our study has shown that variation in temperature is a vital determinant of changes in condition, both at inter- and intra-annual timescales. Furthermore, the principle of latency has been demonstrated at the population level. Indirect effects of competition for energy-rich resources have been shown to have a negative effect on condition. This study supplements our knowledge of the implications for condition of changes in climate and in potential food resources.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000256539800012	18384351

Therefore, if fisheries are to be conducted sustainably, there is a need to promote good fish welfare during the capture process. Purse seine fishing is a widespread and efficient fishing method. However, capture and release of fish from purse seines (a process called "slipping") can result in extremely high mortality in small pelagic schooling species. The objective of this study was to establish behavioural indicators of sub-lethal stress in Atlantic mackerel (Scomberscombrus) that may be used to set safe threshold limits for use in commercial purse seine fishing, in order to ensure good fish welfare and thereby minimise slipping mortality. Controlled mesocosm scale experiments with schools of mackerel in net pens were undertaken to determine behavioural responses to simulated purse seine capture stressors of "crowding", "hypoxia" and "crowding & hypoxia". Crowding (at 30 kg.m(-3)) was achieved by reducing the volume of the net pen, while hypoxia (to 40% oxygen saturation) was achieved by surrounding the net pen with a tarpaulin bag to prevent water exchange. Using video analysis, we investigated behavioural responses in nearest neighbour distances, nearest neighbour angular deviations, tail beat amplitude and tail beat frequency (TBF). Of the metrics considered, only TBF showed a response; a significant increase to "crowding" (42% increase) and "crowding & hypoxia" (38% increase) was found. The increase in TBF in response to "hypoxia" alone (29% increase) was not significant. We therefore conclude that increases in tail beat frequency may be used as an indicator of sub-lethal purse seine capture stress in mackerel that may have utility in minimising post slipping mortality.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000461048900084	30865714

However, to date, active suspension feeders have been the main focus of research, while passive suspension feeders have received less attention. To increase our understanding of energy fluxes in temperate marine ecosystems, we have examined the temporal variability in zooplankton prey capture of the ubiquitous Mediterranean gorgonian Leptogorgia sarmentosa. Prey capture was assessed on the basis of gut content from colonies collected every 2 weeks over a year. The digestion time of zooplankton prey was examined over the temperature range of the species at the study site. The main prey items captured were small (80-200 mum), low-motile zooplankton (i.e. eggs and invertebrate larvae). The digestion time of zooplankton prey increased when temperature decreased (about 150% from 21degreesC to 13degreesC; 15 h at 13degreesC, 9 h at 17degreesC, and 6 h at 21degreesC), a pattern which has not previously been documented in anthozoans. Zooplankton capture rate (prey polyp(-1) h(-1)) varied among seasons, with the greatest rates observed in spring (0.16+/-0.02 prey polyp(-1) h(-1)). Ingestion rate in terms of biomass (mug C polyp(-1) h(-1)) showed a similar trend, but the differences among the seasons were attenuated by seasonal differences in prey size. Therefore, ingestion rate did not significantly vary over the annual cycle and averaged 0.019+/-0.002 mug C polyp(-1) h(-1). At the estimated ingestion rates, the population of L. sarmentosa removed between 2.3 and 16.8 mg C m(-2) day(-1) from the adjacent water column. This observation indicates that predation by macroinvertebrates on seston should be considered in energy transfer processes in littoral areas, since even species with a low abundance may have a detectable impact.									46	0	0	0	47	1	47			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000187504900011

Previous studies showed these three species are the primary predators of young walleye pollock. The stock synthesis model was used to incorporate the three predators as sources of mortality in a single-species catch-at-age analysis. Predators were entered into the model by defining (1) a time series of predator abundance (i.e., effort) over the entire modeled period, (2) a series of pollock consumption data (i.e., catch per unit effort) for each predator for each year when food habits data were available, and (3) the age composition of pollock consumed for each year where food habits data were available. The instantaneous annual predation mortality rates estimated from cod and fur seal predation were small, ranging from about 0.02 to 0.04. However, mortality rates of age-1 pollock due to cannibalism were high.Adding cannibalism on age-1 fish increased model estimates of the number of age-1 pollock in recent years, which changed the apparent stock-recruitment relationship at age 1 from one with declining recruitment at high spawning stock sizes to one where recruitment is more asymptotic at high spawning stock sizes. Our analysis suggests that mortality due to cannibalism on pollock may be an important factor in determining recruitment into the fishery at age 3. Adding predation, and particularly cannibalism, to the model improved the fit of the stock recruitment relationship at age 1. The largest outliers from the estimated relationship were years with generally warmer temperatures and higher inshore transport of surface waters. Oceanographic conditions and predation both appear to play an important role in pollock year-class success. Simultaneously accounting for both these factors in future models of pollock population dynamics may improve our understanding of the relative importance of those factors in determining pollock recruitment.

Influence of grass species on parasitism by spring or autumn-active tiphiid wasps was further assessed on implanted grubs in open enclosures. Masked chafers (Cyclocephala spp.) were three-fold more abundant than Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, grubs in plots of Zoysia and Cynodon sp. mowed at fairway height, and P. japonica were five-fold more abundant than masked chafer grubs in cool-season turf plots mowed at rough height. Phyllophaga spp. accounted for <1% of grubs in the samples. Milky disease bacteria (Paenibacillus sp.) were the predominant pathogens of Cyclocephala spp., followed by Serratia sp. bacteria and gregarines (Stictospora cf. villani). Cyclocephala grub densities, milky disease incidence (25%), and parasitism by the native tiphiid Tiphia pygidialis Allen (10-12%) were especially high in zoysiagrass. Japanese beetle grubs were infected by Paenibacillus, Serratia, Stictospora, and microsporidia (Ovavesicula sp.), but incidence of individual pathogens was relatively low (<6%) and similar among grasses within each stand. Few nematode-infected grubs were found. Skunk damage was mainly in the cool-season fairway-height grasses, probably reflecting difficulty in foraging in the much tougher stolons and rhizomes of the warm season turfgrasses. The degree of natural suppression of scarab grubs provided by endemic pathogens or parasitoids is unlikely to be compromised by the grass species used on a particular site.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000308074900028	22928312

Common metazoans inhabiting acidic mining lakes with a pH below 3 include rotifers in the genera Cephalodella and Elosa. 2The life history response of Cephalodella acidophila to three environmental key factors, pH (2, 3.5, 5.0 and 7.0), temperature (10, 17.5 and 25 degrees C) and food concentration (10000, 35000 and 50000algal cells per mL), was investigated in a full factorial design using life-table experiments. 3The effect of each of the three environmental variables investigated on the rotifer life cycle parameters (life span, fecundity and population growth rate) differed. C.acidophila is a stenoecious species with a pH optimum in the range 34 and a comparably high food threshold. Combining the laboratory results with field data, we conclude that C.acidophila is severely growth limited in its natural habitat. However, low pH alone is not harmful as long as temperatures are moderate to warm and food is abundant. 4The population of C.acidophila in the field is maintained mainly due to release from competitors and predators.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000317625900013	23704795

To cope with this problem two experiments were carried out with predatory fish that do not reproduce in fresh water. One experiment tested the capacity of hybrid bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops) and red-drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) as predators of wild spawning of hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus x O. aureus), and the other compared predation effectiveness of red-drum of different sizes and stocking densities. Both hybrid bass and red-drum effectively reduced tilapia wild spawning and improved by 15-20% tilapia performance and food conversion ratio. These effects were obtained stocking small red-drum (20 g) or large red-drum (60-80 g) or bass (135 g) at stocking densities of 500-1000 predators/ha, together with 15000 tilapia/ha of 65-75 g. Hybrid bass stocked at 750/ha and large red-drum stocked at 500/ha presented over 90% survival. Red-drum at higher stocking density and/or lower stocking weight presented reduced survival (40-60%). Red-drum at all examined stocking weights presented better growth rates when stocked at 500/ha than at higher densities.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0967-6120			WOS:000089753900004

Their life-history strategies were greatly influenced by the characteristics of their environment, i.e., a summer dry period with relatively warm temperatures, but strategies differed among species. Guadalgenus franzi was semivoltine and probably underwent nymphal quiescence when the stream was dry. Hemimelaena flaviventris and I. curtata had relatively short univoltine life cycles that overlapped, but I. curtata was slightly ahead of H. flaviventris. Both species passed the dry period in the egg stage, probably with a diapause phase. Growth rates of H. flaviventris and I. curtata peaked before emergence, whereas growth rate of G. franzi peaked immediately before and after the dry period. The 3 species had relatively short flight periods compared with other species from seasonal streams. Guadalgenus franzi and I. curtata were mainly scrapers that fed on diatoms, whereas H. flaviventris was mainly predatory. Diet changed somewhat in relation to size, and prey electivity patterns differed among species. All 3 species preferred Chironomidae, but G.franzi preferred Chironomidae principally when smaller. All 3 species had high secondary production relative to other stonefly species from both temporary and permanent waters.									43	0	0	0	42	0	46			0887-3593			WOS:000273885900008

The relative value (e.g., size and condition of individual fish, abundance) of specific forage fish stocks to predators under temporally changing oceanographic regimes is also expected to vary. We inferred potential temporal responses in abundance, growth, and age structure of a key forage fish, sand lance, by studying across spatially different oceanographic regimes. Marked meso-scale differences in abundance, growth, and mortality existed in conjunction with these differing regimes. Growth rate within stocks (between years) was positively correlated with temperature. However, this relationship did not exist among stocks (locations) and differing growth rates were better correlated to marine productivity. Sand lance were least abundant and grew slowest at the warmest site (Chisik Island), an area of limited habitat and low food abundance. Abundance and growth of juvenile sand lance was highest at the coolest site (Barren Islands), an area of highly productive upwelled waters. Sand lance at two sites located oceanographically between the Barren Islands and Chisik Island (inner- and outer-Kachemak Bay) displayed correspondingly intermediate abundance and growth. Resident predators at these sites are presented with markedly different numbers and quality of this key prey species. Our results suggest that at the decadal scale, Gulf of Alaska forage fish such as sand lance are probably more profoundly affected by changes in abundance and quality of their planktonic food, than by temperature alone.									32	1	0	0	32	1	36			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000177288700008

Contractile performance of vertebrate muscle depends strongly on temperature, but the release of energy from elastic structures is far less thermally dependent, thus elastic recoil confers thermal robustness to whole-animal performance. Here we explore the role that muscle contractile properties play in the differences in performance and thermal robustness between elastic and non-elastic systems by examining muscle from two species of plethodontid salamanders that use elastically powered tongue projection to capture prey and one that uses non-elastic tongue projection. In species with elastic mechanisms, tongue projection is characterized by higher mechanical power output and thermal robustness compared with tongue projection of closely related genera with non-elastic mechanisms. In vitro and in situ muscle experiments reveal that species differ in their muscle contractile properties, but these patterns do not predict the performance differences between elastic and non-elastic tongue projection. Overall, salamander tongue muscles are similar to other vertebrate muscles in contractile performance and thermal sensitivity. We conclude that changes in the tongue-projection mechanism, specifically the elaboration of elastic structures, are responsible for high performance and thermal robustness in species with elastic tongue projection. This suggests that the evolution of high-performance and thermally robust elastic recoil mechanisms can occur via relatively simple changes to morphology, while muscle contractile properties remain relatively unchanged.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000424076300007	29212843

Stomach contents of 926 specimens, 11.3-29.3 cm TL, collected by beach seine from 1992 to 1993, were analyzed. Of the total number of examined stomachs, 87 were empty (9.4%). This percentage varied significantly over the year, with a maximum number of empty stomachs recorded during the winter and a minimum number recorded during the summer. Copepods constituted the main prey in all size-classes. With fish growth, the proportion of planktonic organisms decreased, while that of fish and benthic organisms increased. The mean weight of stomach contents increased significantly for fish larger than 22.0 cm TL. Diet composition showed little seasonal variation, copepods were the most prey item important in all seasons, especially during the warmer part of the year. Higher intensities of feeding activity in spring and summer could be related to temperature and maximal abundance of zoo-plankton and benthic organisms. The results indicated that the saddled bream fed on a wide range of prey items and could be considered an opportunistic predator.									19	0	0	0	21	0	21			0399-0974			WOS:000188549800004

In California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, extremely low survival of downstream-migrating juvenile salmonids has been ascribed in part to predation by abundant nonnative fishes that have become naturalized in the system. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of removing some of these predatory fish to increase the survival of juvenile salmonids in the San Joaquin River. In 2014 and 2015, we used predation event recorders (PERs) to estimate predation rates before and after localized, experimental predatory fish removals and additions. We also estimated survival of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha before and after predator manipulations in 2014 using acoustic tags. We found no statistically significant evidence for an effect of predator removals or additions on survival rates of Chinook Salmon (as measured by acoustic tags) or on predation rates (as measured by PERs), despite a one-time reduction of approximately 40-70% of all predators from "removal" sites and relocation to "addition" sites.

Immature fish (< 155 cm fork length) made up 88% of these examined. In all, 92 prey taxa were identified. Inshore, the main prey were fish (Trachurus declivis and Emmelichthys nitidus) and juvenile squid (Nototodarus gouldi). Offshore, the diversity was greater, reflecting the diversity of micronekton in these waters. Interestingly, macrozooplankton prey (e.g. Phronima sedentaria) were prevalent in tuna > 150 cm. The offshore tuna, when in subantarctic waters, ate relatively more squid than when in the East Australia Current. In the latter, fish and crustacea were more important, although there were variations between years. No relationship was found between either prey type or size with size of tuna. Feeding was significantly higher in the morning than at other times of the day. The mean weight of prey was significantly higher in inshore-caught tuna than in those caught offshore. We estimated that the mean daily ration of southern bluefin tuna off eastern Tasmania was 0.97% of wet body weight day(-1). However, the daily ration of inshore-caught tuna was similar to 3 times higher (2.7%) than for tuna caught offshore (0.8%) indicating that feeding conditions on the shelf were better than those offshore. Our results indicate that the inshore waters of eastern Tasmania are an important feeding area for, at least, immature southern bluefin tuna.									63	4	0	0	66	0	73			0378-1909			WOS:A1997YD41700005

Vierh. leaves by the large detritivorous mangrove grapsid Sesarma meinerti de Man was measured in the laboratory. This was compared with abscission rates for this mangrove species in the field (Mgazana estuary, Transkei, southern Africa) to estimate how much leaf material was directly utilised by this ecologically dominant crab. Although a significant correlation was found between crab size and dry litter mass ingested per day, no correlation was found between crab size and assimilation efficiency, which was high (82.44%). A seasonal trend in leaf litter fall was discernable with a mean annual rate of 1.79 g m-2 d-1 (653.4 g m-2 y-1). With a mean crab density of 4 m-2 and mean crab size of 40 g, leaf consumption was calculated at 0.78 g m-2 d-1 DM (284.7 g m-2 y-1 or 6462 kJ m-2 y-1), accounting for 43.58% of the leaf fall.For the entire mangrove area (150 ha) a total of 75 t of frasse (955 kJ m-2 y-1) enters the estuary per annum. This is a considerable contribution to the detrital pool of the estuary and increases leaf turnover an estimated four-fold.									102	3	0	0	103	2	114			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:A1992HW82600004

This study was undertaken to estimate the potential economic costs resulting from ocean acidification on UK wild capture and aquaculture shellfish production. Applying the net present value (NPV) and partial equilibrium (PE) models, we estimate both direct and economy-wide economic losses of shellfish production by 2100. Estimates using the NPV method show that the direct potential losses due to reduced shellfish production range from 14% to 28% of fishery NPV. This equates to annual economic losses of between o3 and o6 billion of the UK's GDP in 2013, for medium and high emission scenarios. Results using the PE model showed the total loss to the UK economy from shellfish production and consumption ranging from o23-o88 million. The results from both the direct valuation and predicted estimate for the economic losses on shellfish harvest indicate that there are regional variations due to different patterns of shellfish wild-capture and aquaculture, and the exploitation of species with differing sensitivities to ocean acidification. These results suggest that the potential economic losses vary depending on the chosen valuation method. This analysis is also partial as it did not include a wider group of species in early-life-stages or predator-prey effects. Nevertheless, findings show that the economic losses to the UK and its devolved administrations due to ocean acidification could be substantial. We conclude that addressing ocean acidification with the aim of preserving commercially valuable shellfish resources will require regional, national or international solutions using a combined approach to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions and shift in focus to exploit species that are less vulnerable to ocean acidification.									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			1462-9011	1873-6416		WOS:000435052500009

We tested this hypothesis by studying the breeding biology of pigeon guillemots during 1995-1999 while simultaneously measuring prey abundance with beach seines and bottom trawls. Our study area (Kachemak Bay, Alaska) comprises two oceanographically distinct areas. Populations of a lipid-rich schooling fish, Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), were higher in the warmer Inner Bay than in the colder Outer Bay, and sand lance abundance was higher during warm years. Populations of low-lipid content demersal fishes were similar between areas. Chick survival to age 15 days was 47% higher in the Inner Bay (high-lipid diet) than in the Outer Bay (low-lipid diet), and estimated reproductive success (chicks fledged nest(-1)) was 62% higher in the Inner Bay than in the Outer Bay. Chick provisioning rate (kJ chick(-1) h(-1)) increased with the proportion of sand lance in the diet (r(2)=0.21), as did growth rate (g day(-1)) of younger (beta) chicks in two-chick broods (r(2)=0.14). Pigeon guillemots in the Inner Bay switched to demersal prey during years of below-average sand lance abundance, and these birds reacted to 38-fold interannual changes in sand lance abundance with reductions in beta chick growth rates, with no decline in beta chick survival. In contrast, the proportion of nests experiencing brood reduction in the Outer Bay (demersal diet) increased >300% during years of below-average demersal abundance, although demersal fish abundance varied only 4-fold among years. Our results support the hypothesis that recovery of pigeon guillemot populations from the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is limited by availability of lipid-rich prey.									61	0	0	0	61	0	66			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000177242900018	28547364

The delta O-18 values at the shell margin (=last growth episode) were used as a proxy for temperature at the time closest to the organism's death. Temperature estimates suggest that most individuals died in warmer months, whereas mortality appeared to have been lower during cooler seasons (<24 degrees C). Only drilled valves yielded the coldest temperatures at the shell margin (similar to 18.1-21.3 degrees C), whereas exclusively undrilled valves exhibited the hottest temperatures at the last growth episode (similar to 25.5-26.5 degrees C). Drilled valves were significantly smaller and exhibited higher taphonomic alteration than undrilled valves, pointing to postmortem transport and sorting. While seasonal variations in predation and growth rates may have affected the observed patterns to some extent, the results, at least partly, reflect hydrodynamic variations throughout the year, which may have induced seasonal variation in postmortem sorting of drilled and undrilled valves. This study illustrates that, by combining geochemical proxies and quantitative paleoecological data, more informed ecologic and taphonomic interpretations can be achieved for subfossil and fossil assemblages.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0883-1351	1938-5323		WOS:000306304900010

We use the output of the 3-dimensional (3D) NEMURO nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model applied to the Nor-them Pacific as input to a Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) bicenergetics model, and predict herring weights-at-age and growth from 1948 to 2000 for the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI), Prince William Sound (PWS), and Bering Sea (BS) locations. The feeding parameters of the bioenergetics model were calibrated from steady-state predictions of herring weights-at-age at each location compared to observed mean weights-at-age. Herring weights-at-age were then simulated from 1948 to 2000 using the 3D-NEMURO generated time series of monthly temperature and zooplankton densities. Herring growth rates, annual temperature, and zooplankton density time series were analyzed statistically for coincident shifts in their mean values. We also simulated herring growth rates using the 1948-2000 time series and averaged (climatological) temperature and zooplankton densities to determine the relative importance of temperature and zooplankton to predicted herring growth responses. All three locations showed a shift in herring growth during the mid and late 1970s. Herring growth decreased in WCVI and PWS, and increased in BS; these changes were coincident with a warming of temperature and a decrease in predatory zooplankton density. Herring growth responses in PWS and BS were more complex than those predicted for WCVI, with additional shifts predicted besides the late 1970s shift. Interannual variation in zooplankton densities caused the herring growth response for WCVI. Temperature and zooplankton densities affected the herring growth responses in both Alaskan locations, with zooplankton dominating the response for PWS and temperature dominating the response for BS. We compare our simulated herring growth responses to observed responses, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of using the output of broadly applied lower trophic model as input to fish models in order to examine long-term responses to regime shifts at multiple locations.

On the other hand, it was not able to develop at 35+/-1degreesC, here all N-1 instars used at the beginning of the experiments had died even before moulting to N-2 instar. At alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, the predator reached the adult stage 23.7 (females) and 23.5 (males) days after egg hatching, whereas when the temperatures were increased to 35/22+/-1degreesC, it took a significantly shorter period: 20.6 (females) and 20.9 (males) days. In general, the highest mortality occurred during the first two nymphal instars. The total percentage mortality during development from N-1 to adult stage was 30% and 100% at the constant temperatures 30+/-1degreesC and 35+/-1degreesC, respectively. At the alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, it was lowest with 16.5%, while at 35/22+/-1degreesC, it was 20%.The results of the experiments on prey consumption showed that an individual D. tamaninii consumed during its development to adult stage at 30+/-1degreesC an average of 442.2 (females), 433.6 (males) aphids. At the constant temperature of 35+/-1degreesC, the average daily prey consumption started with 4 aphids and decreased continuously till it approached nil on the 9th day, where all predatory nymphs died. At the alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, the total prey consumption during development was, on average, 359.3 (females) and 297.0 (males) aphids, while at 35/22+/-1degreesC it was 348.5 (females) and 334.0 (males) aphids. The effect of the four temperatures on the prey consumption by D. tamaninii during the first 10 days after emergence was also studied. At a constant temperature of 30+/-1degreesC, a total of 446.4 (females) and 372.0 (males) aphids were consumed, compared to 40.6 (females) and 39.0 (males) at 35+/-1degreesC. At alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, the predatory adult consumed, on average, a total of 267.0 (females) and 207.0 (males) aphids. Increasing the temperature to 35/22+/-1degreesC resulted in a higher prey consumption by the adult predator, reaching 351.5 (females) and 267.7 (males) aphids over the same period.In conclusion, results indicated that D. tamaninii. is a promising predator of the melon aphid at a temperature spectrum ranging from 15+/-1degreesC up to 35+/-1degreesC.									4	2	0	0	7	0	7			1436-5693			WOS:000186361700002		
J	JUANES, F; BUCKEL, JA; CONOVER, DO								ACCELERATING THE ONSET OF PISCIVORY - INTERSECTION OF PREDATOR AND PREY PHENOLOGIES								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				45				41	54		10.1006/jfbi.1994.1213			A	DEC 1994	1994	Piscivorous fishes tend to be able to consume other fishes early in development and generally experience a dramatic increase in growth after the ontogenetic diet shift to piscine prey. Hence, an acceleration of the onset of piscivory may be favoured strongly by natural selection. Temperate freshwater piscivores, for example, becomes piscivorous at a relatively young age by spawning in advance of, and thereby achieving a size advantage over, the young of their piscine prey. Research in various North American estuaries suggests that young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, an offshore-spawning estuarine-dependent marine fish, may accelerate the onset of piscivory by being advected to higher latitudes and timing their estuarine entry with the appearance of small coastal fishes. This hypothesis was tested by: (i) determining the annual recruitment date of YOY bluefish and their prey; and (ii) examining the diet and prey size preferences, and predator size-prey size relationships, of YOY bluefish in two different estuarine systems: Great South Bay, and the lower Hudson River. Results suggest that the relationships between bluefish and their prey are determined by a complex interplay between recruitment timing of both predator and prey, prey size availability, predator selectivities, and the timing of vernal warming. It is concluded that YOY bluefish migration into northern estuaries at an advanced size provides them with a predatory size advantage over their principal piscine prey thereby facilitating an early diet shift to piscivory while minimizing the time spent as planktivores.

With an increase in temperature the time taken for development decreased from 33.7 days at 15 degrees C to 9.2 days at 28 degrees C. The threshold temperature for H. miles to complete its life cycle was between 10 degrees and 12 degrees C. When fed on Acarus sire, H., miles laid 2-3 eggs a day and unfertilized eggs only developed into males. Adults of H. miles (0-1 day old) survived for 24.0 +/- 1.4 days without food and if fed for 6 days and then starved, females lived for 65.4 +/- 2.6 days which was significantly longer than males (45.2 +/- 3.0 days). With food, 60 % of males and females survived for 142 days. All larval instars of sciarids were attacked by H.miles although the numbers consumed were dependent on the size of the larvae. Egg predation was negligible and pupae were not attacked. In productivity studies of H. miles in culture (fed on A. sire), the time taken for the mites to reach a density of 45-65,000/litre ranged from 76 to 23 days at 15 degrees and 28 degrees C respectively.									51	1	0	0	52	0	54			0013-8959			WOS:A1994QG01300011		
B	Deegan, LA; Hughes, JE; Rountree, RA					Rountree, Rodney/0000-0001-5941-8450	Weinstein, MP; Kreeger, DA		Salt marsh ecosystem support of marine transient species								CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY								333	365						2000	2000	One of the most important reasons stated in legislation for protecting salt marshes is their support of commercially and recreationally important nekton (fish and crustaceans). Yet, there is a surprising level of uncertainty among scientists regarding the role of salt marshes in supporting secondary production. The emphasis has been on "marine transient" species (in earlier literature often referred to as "estuarine dependent") because they have life histories that seem designed to place young-of-the-year or juveniles in marsh habitats and because these species are often of commercial or recreational value. Salt marshes are believed to provide: 1) trophic support resulting in high growth rates, 2) increased survivorship due to lowered mortality, and 3) a suitable physico-chemical environment for development of young fishes. In this paper, we consider the evidence for each of these, with an emphasis on the trophic and survivorship aspects. The seasonally warmer temperatures of estuaries and salt marsh creeks apparently provide a metabolic advantage that supports high growth rates. The influence of marsh-derived organic matter in estuarine food webs is apparent, and its importance to marine transient fishes is supported by dietary, behavioral, and isotopic evidence. The major pathways by which marsh organic matter is transferred to fish are largely indirect, through microbial and invertebrate intermediaries. Invertebrates are the primary link to fish consumers of marsh-associated production, transforming microphytes, organic detritus, and microbial detrital heterotrophs into available biomass. Although most detrital organic carbon entering salt marsh systems, mainly from emergent grasses, is apparently respired by heterotrophs, the support of consumers by marsh plant detritus and microalgae can be equally important. The use of salt marsh detritus in food webs usually occurs in close proximity to the salt marsh indicating that outwelling of salt marsh organic matter offshore is not the dominant way that salt marshes support offshore fisheries. Salt marsh support of offshore fisheries is more probably by direct export of juvenile fish biomass and a trophic relay involving ontogenetic and cyclic migrations of nekton species, rather than export of organic detritus. Understanding the controls on marine transient fish mortality is probably the most problematic and least studied aspect of their ecology. The few estimates of mortality rates of fishes in estuaries are as high as, or higher than, mortality rates of fishes in other marine and Freshwater ecosystems. However, because of faster growth rates, fish spend less rime in the small stages with the higher mortality rates. Within estuaries, mortality rates for some species, but not all, are lower in marsh creeks compared to more open areas. The value of marshes as refuge habitat is probably due to the interaction of temperature, turbidity, and vegetative structure in restricting the foraging of piscine predators.

Hedgehog density was estimated from distance sampling surveys applied to 43 line-transects visited monthly in 2006 and 2007. Hedgehogs were detected by using infrared binoculars. They were captured to be sexed, age-classified and marked. Earthworm, arthropod and pet food availability as well as distance to the nearest badger sett were assessed per transect through field sampling. Hedgehog population density, estimated from the detection of 127 hedgehogs, was 4.4 +/- 1.3 individuals km(-2) in the rural area and 36.5 +/- 15.2 individuals km(-2) in the urban area, where transects had lower arthropod biomass, higher pet food availability, and a greater distance from badger setts than in rural area. Adult hedgehog abundance was predicted by earthworm biomass and pet food availability. The number of young per adult female was predicted by arthropod biomass and distance to the nearest badger sett. The high urban hedgehog density did not seem to be mainly induced by an increase in reproductive rate and cannot be fully explained by food resource availability. The effect of variations in road kills and winter mortality factors between urban and rural area are discussed. We concluded that the combination of anthropogenic food and sheltered climatic conditions may provide good situations for hedgehogs and other hibernator species in urbanised environment.

J	Bonar, SA; Bolding, BD; Divens, M; Meyer, W								Effects of introduced fishes on wild juvenile coho salmon in three shallow Pacific Northwest lakes								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				134	3			641	652		10.1577/T04-154.1				MAY 2005	2005	Declines in Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. have been blamed on hydropower, overfishing, ocean conditions, and land use practices; however, less is known about the impacts of introduced fish. Most of the hundreds of lakes and ponds in the Pacific Northwest contain introduced fishes, and many of these water bodies are also important for salmon production, especially of coho salmon O. kisutch. Over 2 years, we examined the predation impacts of 10 common introduced fishes (brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus, black crappie Pomoxis nigro-maculatus, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas, green sunfish L. cyanellus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, pumpkinseed L. gibbosus, rainbow trout O. mykiss, warmouth L. gulosus, and yellow perch Perca flavescens) and two native fishes (cutthroat trout O. clarkii and prickly sculpin Cottus asper) on wild juvenile coho salmon in three shallow Pacific Northwest lakes, all located in different watersheds. Of these species, largemouth bass were responsible for an average of 98% of the predation on coho salmon in all lakes, but the total impact to each run varied among lakes and years. Very few coho salmon were eaten by black crappies, brown bullheads, cutthroat trout, prickly sculpin, or yellow perch, whereas other species were not observed to eat coho salmon. Juvenile coho salmon growth in all lakes was higher than in nearby streams. Therefore, food competition between coho salmon and introduced fishes in lakes was probably not limiting coho salmon populations. Largemouth bass are widespread and are present in 85% of lowland warmwater public-access lakes in Washington (n = 421), 84% of those in Oregon (n = 179), and 74% of those in the eight northwestern most counties in California (n = 19). Future research would help to identify the impact of largemouth bass predation across the region and prioritize takes where impacts are most severe. Nevertheless, attempts to transplant or increase largemouth bass numbers in lakes important to coho salmon would be counterproductive to coho salmon enhancement efforts.									11	0	0	0	15	0	17			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000229724300009

The warm temperate Mondego estuary (Western Portugal), in common with many other shallow estuarine areas, is exhibiting increased macroalgal growth due to nutrient enrichment. The increase of macroalgal biomass and possible shift of other primary producers resulting from eutrophication, may have profound effects on estuarine trophic chain. The present paper examined the performance of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (SDM) in predicting the tendencies of three representative trophic levels as a response to the increase of nutrient concentrations. Therefore, the proposed methodology has been developed by focusing on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as primary producers (macroalgae and seagrass), some relevant benthic macroinvertebrates, wading birds and changes in local physicochemical conditions. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure (stepwise multiple regression analysis) performed to discriminate the significant relationships between prevailing biological and environmental variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of habitat changes. The data used in the model construction was sampled between January 1993 and September 1995 in three areas of the estuary mudflats for benthic macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, environmental and physicochemical factors and from October 1993 to October 1994 for wading birds. The model validation was based on independent data collected in two different periods, from January 1996 to January 1997 and from February 1999 to April 2000 for all the variables selected. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the model reliability in capturing the trophic dynamics of the studied estuary by predicting the behavioural pattern for the most part of the components selected under a very complex and variable environmental scenario.

Where growth of phytoplankton, epiphyton and filamentous algae is excessive, all may contribute to shading that limits macrophyte growth. However, when abundant, herbivorous snails may dampen this effect by reducing the biomass of epiphyton, and perhaps also of nuisance filamentous algae, both which have the potential to become more abundant in a future warmer world. We studied the effects of herbivorous snails (Radix swinhoei) on the biomass of phytoplankton, epiphyton and filamentous algae as well as the growth of the submerged macrophyte, Vallisneria denseserrulata, under contrasting nutrient loadings (low, nitrogen (N) 113 mu g L-1.d(-1) and phosphorus (P) 10 mu g L(-1.)d(-1): high, N 339 mu g L-1.d(-1) and P 30 mu g L-1.d(-1)) in a 30 day outdoor mesocosm experiment, conducted on the shore of subtropical Lake Taihu, China. We found significant interactive effects of nutrient loading and snail presence on biomasses of epiphyton and filamentous algae and on the biomass and relative growth rate of submerged macrophytes. When snails were absent, the biomass of epiphyton and the biomass and coverage of filamentous algae all increased markedly, while the biomass, density and relative growth rate of V. denseserrulata decreased significantly with increased nutrient loading. When snails were present, biomasses of epiphyton, phytoplankton and filamentous algae were significantly reduced and growth of V. denseserrulata significantly increased under both high and low nutrient loading scenarios, and the effect was most pronounced in the nutrient-rich treatment. The present study suggests that in shallow aquatic ecosystems, herbivorous snails reduce the negative impact of nutrient loading on submerged macrophyte growth, by controlling both epiphyton and nuisance filamentous algae. How best to protect snails from fish predation in order to realize this potential under natural conditions is a matter that warrants further studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the field, the intensity of seed predation by invertebrates varies during the course of a year. One source of this variation is fluctuations in ambient temperature. Here, the effect of temperature on seed consumption is investigated for the first time, using two abundant carabid seed predators, Pseudoophonus rufipes and Harpalus affinis (Coleoptera: Carabidae), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) as a model system. Field collected individuals were sexed, kept at one of six constant temperatures between 10 and 28 degrees C and provided with a surplus of seed. Seed consumption was recorded over a period of 4 days. Averaged over all the temperatures, the smaller H. affinis consumed 12.2 seeds day(-1) and larger P. rufipes 29 seeds day(-1). On average, females consumed more seeds than males. Seed consumption by both species increased with temperature. In H. affinis the increase was linear and different for males and females. In P. rufipes the consumption was similar in both sexes but curvilinear because there was no further increase in consumption above 20 degrees C. Assuming a linear relationship between temperature and consumption at up to 20 degrees C we calculated the temperature at which seed consumption ceased (-0.1 to 0.3 degrees C in H. affinis and 6.3-6.9 degrees C in P. rufipes) and the increment in seed consumption per 1 degrees C increase in temperature above this threshold (0.4-1.0 and 1.5-4.2 seeds individual(-1) day(-1), respectively) for the two species. Thus, it is possible to calculate the average daily consumption of each species over a range of temperatures up to 20 degrees C. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In terms of bio-control, these unspecialised predators may be sustained in the field when pest populations are low by predating on other animals such as earthworms. The aim of this study was to reveal patterns in predation by a community of carabids in the field on different earthworm species with respect to anecic, endogeic and epigeic earthworm ecotypes.Materials and methods: We utilised DNA extracted from the gut content of 23 carabid species to reveal predation on earthworms directly in the field, comparing spring and autumn active species. The DNA was then screened using PCR with five earthworm species-specific primers.Results and discussion: Our results show that 20 species, which accounted for 53% of all tested individual beetles, were positive for earthworms, with similar proportions in the spring and autumn samples and between the sexes. Earthworms from all three ecotypes were confirmed within the predator guts and were widely consumed within the carabid community.Conclusions: These results suggest that predation on earthworms might be an important mechanism sustaining populations of generalist predatory carabids in the field, which can be advantageous for biological control. Therefore, management systems that maintain a healthy soil with all three ecotypes of earthworm present is likely to be beneficial for carabids and indirectly for control of plant pests.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0031-5362			WOS:000390572000014

To evaluate the effect of hypoxia on pelagic striped bass ( Morone saxatilis), we quantified the growth rate potential ( GRP) of age- 2 and age- 4 fish in Chesapeake Bay during 1996 and 2000 using observed temperature, dissolved oxygen, and prey abundance information in a spatially explicit bioenergetics modeling framework. Regions of the Bay with bottom hypoxia were generally areas with high quality habitat ( i. e., GRP > 0 g center dot g(-1) center dot day(-1)), primarily because prey fish were forced into warm, oxygenated surface waters suitable for striped bass foraging and growth. In turn, by concentrating fish prey above the oxycline and removing bottom waters as a refuge, hypoxia likely enhanced striped bass predation efficiency and contributed to the recovery of striped bass during the mid- 1990s, a time when the striped bass fishery also was closed. This short- term positive effect of hypoxia on striped bass, however, appears to have been counterbalanced by a long- term negative effect of hypoxia in recent years. Ultimately, hypoxia- enhanced predation efficiency, combined with an abundance of striped bass due to restricted harvest, appears to be causing overconsumption of prey fishes in Chesapeake Bay, thus helping to explain poor growth and health of striped bass in recent years.									43	0	0	0	42	0	44			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000255671700017		
J	Yoklavich, MM; Loeb, VJ; Nishimoto, M; Daly, B								Nearshore assemblages of larval rockfishes and their physical environment off central California during an extended El Nino event, 1991-1993								FISHERY BULLETIN				94	4			766	782						OCT 1996	1996	Rockfish are among the most prevalent members of nearshore ichthyoplankton assemblages off central California, yet their abundance varies greatly from year to year. Warm events, like El Nino, can have pronounced effects on the success of a year class. We evaluate distribution, abundance, and species composition of rockfish larvae on small spatial and temporal scales in the upwelling center north of Monterey Bay during an extended El Nino (December 1991 through June 1993) relative to regional hydrography.Anomalously warm, low-salinity water to depths greater than 50 m during much of our study was indicative of an onshore displacement of the California Current; Upwelling was reduced and delayed relative to other years. The two years differed, however, in the intensity, duration, frequency, and direction of wind events. Larval rockfish abundance was similar in both years of the El Nino, peaking in early February, and was among the highest when compared with estimates from CalCOFI surveys off central California (1951-84). Using larval ages, we determined that median birthdates of shortbelly rockfish were in early- to mid-February both years. Growth rates of larval shortbelly rockfish did not differ among months or between years. Relative to 1993, rockfish larvae were more abundant; and sizes of larval shortbelly were significantly greater at onshore stations in 1992. This coincided with onshore advection of water during the onset of the El Nino, suggesting retention of larvae nearshore. Initiation of upwelling in March and April 1993 and fewer larvae at onshore stations are indicative of greater offshore transport during the second year.Juvenile rockfishes were extremely rare in summer of 1992; in 1993 they were twenty times more abundant and larger. Surviving juvenile shortbelly rockfish were born late during both years; upwelling occurred coincidentally during this period in 1993 but not in 1992. We suggest that substantially higher survival and recruitment of juvenile rockfishes in 1993 was due to increased offshore transport and perhaps lower predation during the larval stages.									44	0	0	0	28	0	44			0090-0656	1937-4518		WOS:A1996VM74500015

However, several counteracting mechanisms can buffer the effect of reduced IGP. Here, we investigated whether the cardboard bands installed in pear trees in early winter improve the suppression of the serious pest pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyre) by winter-active spiders (Anyphaena accentuate and Philodromus spp.). We also investigated in laboratory experiments whether the increased abundances of some predators (Philodromus sp.) would result in negative or positive predator-predator interactions and whether the type and/or intensity of interaction is temperature dependent. On average, pear trees with cardboard bands hosted less psylla than control trees. This pattern can be attributed to predation by winter-active spiders, as 45% of individuals were psylla positive using molecular gut-content analysis. However, 58% of Anyphaena spiders were also Philodromus positive. The suppression efficiency for psylla increased asymptotically with the increasing density of winter-active spiders. In the laboratory, the per capita capture rate of philodromids decreased with the density of conspecifics, which translated in an asymptotic increase in predation pressure on the pear psylla. Non consumptive intra-trophic-level interference was more intense at 12 degrees C than at 7 degrees C. The results show that artificially increasing habitat complexity by installing corrugated cardboard bands around the trunks and branches of pear trees increased predation pressure on the pear psylla as it most likely reduced IGP among winter-active spiders. However, increased intra-trophic-level interference due to increased abundances of spiders reduced their per capita capture rate and caused only an asymptotic increase in the overall predation pressure on the pest. The installation of corrugated cardboard bands around trees could represent an environmentally friendly management practice in fruit orchards that improves the biocontrol service provided by generalist predators.									21	0	0	0	18	1	23			0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000403033400004

In this review we focus on how life-history attributes influence the production dynamics of stream insects and other macroinvertebrates. Annual production of macroinvertebrate communities in streams world-wide ranges from approximately 10(0) to 10(3) g dry mass m(-2). High levels are reported for communities dominated by filter feeders in temperate streams. Filter feeding enables the accrual and support of high biomass, which drives the very highest production. Frequently disturbed communities in warm-temperate streams are also highly productive. Biomass accrual by macroinvertebrates is limited in these streams, and production is driven by rapid growth rates rather than high biomass. The lowest production, reported for macroinvertebrate communities of cool-temperate and arctic streams, is due to the constraints of low seasonal temperatures and nutrient or food limitation. Geographical bias, paucity of community-wide studies, and limited knowledge of the effects of biotic interactions limit current understanding of mechanisms controlling stream productivity.									203	10	2	0	196	7	224			0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000086173900004	10761571

The dry mass of this species in the Sundays Estuary during 1986/87 ranged from 11 g . m(-3) in the lower reaches to 178 g . m(-3) in the middle reaches. The average total biomass of G. aestuaria in the estuary was 219 kg, with a maximum value of 723 kg dry mass recorded in November 1986. Daily food consumption by the estuarine round herring ranged from 0,6 mg . m(-3) . day(-1) in the lower reaches to 20,4 mg . m(-3).day(-1) in the middle reaches. On average, G. aestuaria consumed almost 19 kg dry mass of food per day in the Sundays Estuary during 1986/87, or 6,9 tons dry mass per year. Most food consumption occurred during summer (37 kg . day(-1)), compared to only 1 kg . day(-1) in winter. The higher summer consumption coincides with increased zooplankton abundance in the Sundays system during the warmer months. Calculations indicate that production by the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei in the Sundays Estuary could provide at least 50% of the food requirements of the resident G. aestuaria population.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0257-7615			WOS:000168876300006

Mites preferred second-stage juveniles of plant parasitic nematodes but predaceous nematodes resisted predation comparatively better than others. Physical and behavioural characteristics have been attributed to the cause of resistance. Predation by T. putrescentiae is density dependent which required essentially a contact between the chelecerae and the body of prey. Chelecerae are the main killing and feeding organs. Legs are used to hold the prey during attack and feeding. An injured prey, if escaped, attracted other mites which aggregated at feeding site. The aggregation of mites at feeding site often resulted in struggle amongst them in order to snatch the prey and feed. Factors like temperature, agar concentrations, agar thicknesses and test arena governed predation by T. putrescentiae. The mites turned coprophagous (feeding on their own excreta) in the absence of prey. No cannibalistic behaviour was observed in T. putrescentiae either in the presence or absence of prey nematodes.									16	1	0	0	15	2	18			1164-5571			WOS:A1994NZ62700001

Efficiency in nitrogen uptake from prey was evaluated by tracing N-15 from N-15-enriched Drosophila flies fed to the plants. The in situ uptake efficiency differed somewhat between species and ranged from 29 to 41% of prey N. This efficiency was not affected by different feeding levels or plant reproductive status (flowering or non-flowering). A test of the amount of N absorbed from prey caught on flower stalks of Pinguicula villosa and P, vulgaris showed that both species took up little of what was available in prey (2.5% or less). The uptake efficiency found in greenhouse grown plants was higher than in plants in situ (40-50% vs. 30-40% respectively). This could probably best be explained by the absence of rain and a higher temperature in the greenhouse. The prey-derived N-15 was traced to reproductive organs and winter buds, Non-flowering individuals allocated 58-97% of the N derived from prey to their winter buds. Flowering individuals allocated 17-43% of the N income from prey to reproduction, while 34-71% were allocated to buds. Root uptake of nitrogen was stimulated by increased prey capture, This increase in uptake of nitrogen from the substrate was larger than the potential direct uptake of nitrogen from captured prey.									41	0	1	0	39	0	42			0029-8549			WOS:A1996UP60000010	28307324

We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to examine how detection of prey DNA in the gut content of predators was influenced by digestion time and temperature. Such knowledge is critical before applying PCR-based gut content analysis to field collected predators. Larvae of the two-spotted ladybeetle (Adalia bipunctata L.) were fed with the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) at either 21 degrees C or 14 degrees C. After consuming one aphid, the predators were allowed to digest the prey for a range of time periods up to 24 hours. The influence of temperature on A. bipunctata feeding behavior was also recorded. From the fed larvae, total DNA was extracted and PCR reactions with R. padi specific primers were run. The number of A. bipunctata that tested positive for R. padi DNA was negatively related to the length of digestion time. Temperature influenced larval feeding behavior but did not have a significant effect on R. padi DNA detection. After pooling the data from both temperature treatments we estimated the time point when R. padi DNA could be amplified from 50% of the fed A. bipunctata by PCR to be 4.87 hours. With such a rapid decrease in prey DNA detection success, positive PCR reactions will most likely be the result of predation events occurring shortly before capture. If a defined digestion temperature range has proven not to influence prey detection, PCR data obtained from predators collected within that particular range can be interpreted in the same way.									23	2	0	0	23	0	24			1672-9609			WOS:000249883300001

Defensive polyps protruding from the skeleton are numerous and highly toxic and for this reason millepores are popularly known as "stinging corals" or 'fire corals. " In shallow tropical seas millepore colonies are conspicuous on coral reefs and may be locally abundant and important reef-framework builders. The history of systematic research on the Milleporidae and the sister family Stylasteridae is rich and full with the works of early naturalists beginning with Linnaeus. Seventeen living millepore species are recognised. Marked phenotypic variation inform and structure of colonies is characteristic of the genus Millepora. The first published descriptions of the anatomy and histology of millepores were by H. N. Moseley in one of the Challenger Expedition reports. These original, detailed accounts by Moseley remain valid and, except for recent descriptions of the ultrastructure of the skeleton and skeletogenic tissues, have not needed much modification.Millepores occur worldwide on coral reefs at depths of between I and 40 m and their distribution on reefs is generally zoned in response to physical factors. Colonies may be abundant locally on coral reefs but usually comprise < 10% of the overall surface cover. Growth rates of colonies are similar to the measured rates of branching and platelike scleractinian corals. Millepores are voracious zooplankton feeders and they obtain part of their nutrition from autotrophic sources, photosynthetic production by symbiotic zooxanthellae.Reproduction in millepores is characterised by alternation of generations with a well-developed polypoid stage that buds off planktonic medusae. Sexual reproduction is seasonal for known species and the medusae have a brief planktonic life. Asexual production is achieved by sympodial growth, the production of new skeleton and soft tissue along a growing edge or branch tip, and by the reattachment, regeneration and repair of damaged or broken colony fragments.The physiological and ecological responses of species of millepores are similar to those of the species of scleractinian corals over a broad range of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Severe damage to colonies may occur during major storms. Delicately branching species are more susceptible than massive and bladed species. The ability of broken fragments to regenerate can ameliorate the extent of damage. Widespread bleaching and mortality of millepores has been reported during mass bleaching events that have affected many coral reefs. Millepores are often the first to recover after short-term bleaching events. Harmful effects of oil spills, chronic oil pollution and oil-spill detergents have been widely reported for millepores.Although the hydrozoan coenosarc, with its fiercely stinging zooids, does not appear to be an attractive substratum for attachment and settlement Of epizooans, a number of sessile and errant forms commonly occur on millepores. These include barnacles, amphipods, tanaid and alpheid crustaceans, polychaetes and gastropods. Burrowing molluscs, polychaetes and crustacea also abound. Many of these species or their close relatives also occur on scleractinian corals. A variety of predators, grazers and fouling organisms occur on millepores. These include errant polychaetes, several coral-feeding fish and a gastropod mollusc. Various invasive green, red and brown algae are widespread, growing on dead branches of millepores and overgrowing live coral tissue. Various "band diseases" associated with microorganisms that appear to cause lesions on millepores and loss of tissue have been documented but are not of widespread occurrence. Infestations of endolithic algae and fungi growing within the skeletons have been reported in a number of millepore species.									61	0	0	0	58	2	62			0065-2881		0-12-026151-0	WOS:000238223900001	16782450

We examined length, mass, and condition index of age-0 juveniles collected in the ocean during June and September across 11 years in relation to conditions in the river, estuary, and coastal ocean and to future adult returns. Characteristics of juveniles in September, but not June, were related to adult returns. During years when coastal waters were relatively cool and productive, juveniles captured in September displayed relatively low condition and reduced otolith growth compared with years when coastal waters were relatively warm and unproductive; this contrast indicates that top-down effects such as selective mortality or competition are important during early marine residence. Key physical (river plume volume during emigration) and biological (condition) variables and their interaction accounted for >95% of the variation in adult returns. Future research should focus on evaluating predators and competitors and understanding how river plume structure influences survival.									35	1	0	0	35	0	39			0706-652X			WOS:000317750700013

Understanding how environmental variables influence its abundance and movement is important for better decision-making. This study used mark-recapture to examine the association between abiotic (temperature, salinity, wind speed, tides moon phase, and sediment coarseness) and biotic (presence of predators and bottom vegetation) variables with bonefish movement and abundance in Corozal-Chetumal bay and the adjacent Caribbean coast of southern Mexico and northern Belize. We used seines to capture bonefish, marked 9657 using dart tags and recaptured 595 fish (6.2% recapture rate) during 16 sample periods between January 2016 and February 2018. Marked bonefish size ranged 19.5-56.4 cm and recaptured 23.9-49.4 cm. Total abundance for each seine sample and distance between mark and recapture locations were used in two separate multiple stepwise regression analyses. Movement was negatively associated with temperature and predator presence, while sediment coarseness and moon phase were positively associated. Temperature increases were associated with short-distance movements. Temperature decreases and high-illumination lunar phases were associated with longer-distance movement and likely related to spawning migrations. Presence of predators, like barracuda, was associated with low bonefish abundances and was likely an adaptive response to form multiple schools of low density by bonefish to avoid predation. These spatiotemporal movement and abundance patterns are recommended to be taken into account in fisheries and protected areas management and to inform the decision-making process in urban and tourism development in coastal habitats.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000490197100001		
J	KOBLUK, DR; LYSENKO, MA								HURRICANE EFFECTS ON SHALLOW-WATER CRYPTIC REEF MOLLUSKS, FIJI ISLANDS								JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY				67	5			798	816		10.1017/S0022336000037069				SEP 1993	1993	An assemblage of 343 species of cryptic, shelled molluscs was identified in three large samples from shallow subtidal and intertidal shelter habitats under rubble and corals at Malololailai Fiji in 1983, 1984, and 1985. One species was apolyplacophoran, 273 were gastropods (38 families), and 69 were bivalves (21 families). Cryptic gastropods were more abundant than bivalves, but showed a reduction in abundance relative to bivalves from 1983 to 1985. The abundances of many cryptic molluscs show dramatic adjustments from 1983 to 1985, chiefly due to hurricanes in 1983 and 1985, showing a decrease in equitability with increased physical disturbance. The abundance and diversity of molluscan predators in the crypts means that predation in these habitats may be substantial.The gastropod sample diversity showed the greatest change during the 1984 post-hurricane recovery period. The 1985 hurricanes affected the sample diversity by shifting the gastropod diversity closer to what it was after the 1983 hurricane. The bivalves underwent a similar shift in sample diversity, although larger numbers of individuals in proportionately more species survived the hurricanes.The cryptic bivalves exploited space in new crypts, while maintaining their rate of increase in abundance in the recovery period after the 1983 hurricane and through the two hurricanes in 1985. The gastropods declined in abundance after the 1983 hurricane. They recovered after the 1985 hurricanes by doubling their abundance, showing that they could exploit new resources in crypts. This increase in the gastropod population was not proportional to the increase in available cryptic space. This may mean they were still recovering in August 1985, or they may have been unable to capture their portion of cryptic space in competition with other organisms during recovery.The 1985 hurricanes did not have much effect on the overall molluscan diversity, a possible result of pruning by the 1983 hurricane of molluscs unable to survive storms. Because there was only a short interval between the hurricanes, many molluscs that survived the 1983 event were still in the population, so that the cryptic molluscs probably were better able to deal with the effects of the 1985 hurricanes than they would have been before the 1983 hurricane. The result was that the sample diversity after the 1983 hurricane increased during the recovery period but did not decline later even though the population was devastated by hurricanes in 1985. This lends support to intermediate disturbance models linking increasing or stable diversity with disturbances spaced at intervals allowing recovery.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0022-3360			WOS:A1993LY34700007

Skeels (Ericales: Sapotaceae) is an endemic and emblematic tree growing in the centre and the southwest of Morocco. Argan fruits are frequently infested by the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata Wied (Diptera: Tephritidae). To date, no control program has been undertaken in the Argan forest. This research is the first investigation of natural mortality factors of C. capitata larvae in the Argan forest. The study was conducted at two localities near the city of Essaouira with different climatic conditions. Observations were conducted using 260 late instar larvae which were individually deposited on the ground, under fruiting host trees, where they naturally fall to find a suitable pupation site. Overall, 42% of the larvae died before being able to burrow into the ground, irrespectively of the location. Larval survival and their likelihood of burrowing decreased with increasing ground temperature, as 53% of all the larvae deaths occurred at temperatures over 48 degrees C. However, at lower ground temperature, predation by ants and spiders accounted for 47% of all mortality. Four species of ants carried out 94% of the captures. Monomorium subopacum Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), which frequently forages under Argan trees, was by far the most efficient predator, due to a powerful sting that rapidly immobilizes the prey. Our results suggest that the burrowing performance of larvae is constrained by high thermal conditions and the presence of ant predators at lower temperatures.									13	0	0	0	14	0	14			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000278497600008

The Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella (AFS), a marine predator in the Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem with a circumpolar distribution, exhibits a short, 4 mo lactation coinciding with increased summer marine productivity. The diet of AFS, and the distance to significant and productive oceanographic features, such as the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), varies considerably between populations. We studied the foraging activity, foraging efficiency and the pup provisioning strategies of lactating AFS at a key breeding site in the southern Indian Ocean, the Kerguelen Archipelago. Foraging parameters were examined in relation to interannual variability in oceanographic conditions and prey availability in the PFZ over 3 consecutive breeding seasons (1998 to 2000). The location of foraging zones, diving activity, diet and foraging efficiency varied significantly between years, concurrently with annual changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) and prey availability. The strongest recorded El Nino Southern Oscillation event in 1997-1998 coincided with anomalously warm waters in the vicinity of the Archipelago. Deeper diving by females, reduced maternal and pup body condition, and minimal pup growth rates and low catch per unit effort of the primary prey species, lanternfishes (Myctophidae) were all recorded in this period. Maternal size was positively related to the growth performance of pups only in this period, indicating the importance of age/size and/or experience in mediating environmental fluctuations. Foraging efficiency over a foraging cycle and variability in mean provisioning rates (trip duration), were identified as proxies of prey availability within the foraging range of seals, emphasising the effectiveness of the use of AFS foraging behaviour as an indicator of both food and oceanographic variability and climatic anomalies. The increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST events in sectors of the SO, however, may elicit specific behavioural responses from 'central place foragers' (i.e. species that return to breeding sites to feed their young) to avoid sustained poor body condition of females and their weaned offspring.									65	0	0	0	55	0	67			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000237558000008		
J	SAULICH, A. Kh.; MUSOLIN, D.L.							Саулич, А.X.; Мусолин, Д.Л.	DIAPAUSE IN THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF STINK BUGS (HETEROPTERA, PENTATOMIDAE) FROM THE TEMPERATE ZONE]				ДИАПАУЗА В СЕЗОННОМ ЦИКЛЕ ЩИТНИКОВ (HETEROPTERA, PENTATOMIDAE) УМЕРЕННОГО ПОЯСА				Entomological Review	Энтомологическое обозрение			90	4			740	774						2011	2011	For the first time in the world literature, this paper reviews the data on diapause and related phenomena in stink bugs (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). The family includes about 4700 species (i. e. more than 10 % of the described world Heteroptera fauna). Using stink bugs as examples, the consecutive stages of the complex dynamic process of diapause (such as diapause preparation, induction, initiation, maintenance, termination, post-diapause quiescence, and resumption of direct development) are described and discussed. Out of 43 pentatomid species studied in relation to diapause in the Temperate Zone up to date, the majority (38 species) overwinter as adults, two species - as eggs, and another two species - as nymphs. <i>Pentatoma rufipes </i>is believed to be able to overwinter at different stages of its life cycle. Less than 5% of pentatomid species are probably able to overwinter twice. Only five species have obligate diapause, others have the facultative one. Day-length and temperature are the main diapause inducing factors in the majority of species. The role of food in the control of seasonal development is essential in the pentatomid species feeding on plant seeds. In different species, different stages are sensitive to day-length. Some pentatomids retain sensitivity to photoperiod even after diapause, others lose it and become photo-refractory (temporarily or permanently). In the pentatomid family, such seasonal adaptations as photoperiodic control of nymphal growth rates, seasonal body colour change, migrations, and summer diapause (aestivation) are widely represented, whereas wing and/or wing muscle polymorphism has not been reported yet. Species from the subfamily Podopinae overwinter in adult diapause and induction of facultative reproductive winter is under the control of photoperiod and temperature. All of these species feed on seeds and their seasonal development to a great extent reflects availability of food. However, the same food preferences and pattern of seasonal development are characteristic to many species from the subfamily Pentatominae (in particular, to most members of the tribe Aeliini). All species of the subfamily Asopinae are predators. Among them, <i>Picromerus bidens </i>and <i>Apateticus cynicus </i>have obligate embryonic (egg) winter diapause, which is rear among true bugs, although these two species belong to different tribes (Platinopini and Amyoteini, respectively). At the same time, <i>A. cynicus </i>and <i>Podisus maculiventris </i>belong to the same tribe (Amyoteini) but have different types of diapause: obligate embryonic diapause in <i>A. cynicus </i>and facultative adult diapause in <i>P. maculiventris. </i>Other Asopinae species studied up to date have facultative adult diapause controlled by photoperiod and temperature. Probably, there is only one exception: in <i>Andrallus spinidens, </i>adult diapause is controlled by temperature, and photoperiod plays only a secondary role. Thus, in spite of the similar habits and feeding types among Asopinae (all of them are predators), the species within this subfamily have different types of diapause and the latter is controlled by different factors. In the subfamily Pentatominae, on the contrary, most of the species overwinter as adults and induction of their diapause is controlled the long-day type photoperiodic response, in spite of the differences in their feeding preferences (within phytophagy). However, there are some exceptions in this subfamily, too: <i>Palomena prasina, P. angulosa </i>and <i>Menida scotti </i>have obligate diapause, which conditions univoltinism in these pentatomids. In <i>M. scotti, </i>only females have obligate adult diapause, whereas males remain physiologically active through the whole winter, this pattern being unusual for Heteroptera. The presence of <i>Pentatoma rufipes </i>with obligate nymphal diapause and <i>Nezara viridula </i>with facultative adult diapause in the same tribe Pentatomini seems unexpected. Among all studied species in the tribe Aeliini, only <i>Aelia rostrata </i>has obligate adult diapause. The univoltine seasonal cycle of this species with summer diapause (aestivation) and apparent migrations is similar to that of shield bugs (Scutelleridae). According to the analysis of seasonal development, the evolution of seasonal adaptations in Pentatomidae does not directly reflect their phylogeny. However, individual genera (e. g., <i>Palomena </i>with obligate diapause and photoperiodic control of nymphal growth rates or <i>Euschistus </i>with photoperiodic control of coloration), small tribes (such as Aeliini) or even subfamilies (Podopinae) have similar complexes of seasonal adaptations. At the same time, Pentatominae is a large and apparently collected taxon, but most of species in this subfamily have the same facultative adult diapause. In general, in spite of the intensive studies of seasonal adaptations in Pentatomidae and other Heteroptera families during the recent decades, diapause and ecological mechanisms of its regulation are still studied in less than 1 % of described pentatomid species.			Обзор содержит первое в мировой литературе обобщение материалов по диапаузе и сопряженным с ней явлениям в семействе щитников (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), насчитывающем около 4700 видов (более 10 % мировой фауны полужесткокрылых насекомых). На примере щит-ников рассмотрены последовательные этапы диапаузы (как сложного динамического процесса), состоящие в подготовке к диапаузе, ее индукции, становлении, развитии, реактивации, постдиапаузном оцепенении и возобновлении активного развития. Из 43 видов щитников, исследованных в отношении диапаузы в зоне умеренного климата, подавляющее большинство (38 видов) зимуют на стадии имаго, два вида зимуют на стадии яйца и два вида - на стадии личинки. Вероятно, только <i>Pentatoma rufipes </i>способен зимовать на разных стадиях жизненного цикла. Не более 5 % видов, возможно, способно зимовать дважды. Лишьу5изизученных видов диапауза облигатная, у остальных она факультативная. Основными факторами, индуцирующими диапаузу у большинства видов, являются длина дня и температура. У щитников, питающихся семенами, в регуляции сезонного развития велика роль пищи. Чувствительность к длине дня у разных видов приурочена к разным стадиям, при этом у одних видов она сохраняется и после диапаузы, у других в процессе диапаузно-го развития наступает временная или постоянная фоторефрактерность. В семействе широко представлена фотопериодическая регуляция скорости роста личинок, сезонное изменение окраски, миграции и летняя диапауза, но пока не известен полиморфизм крыльев или крыловой мускулатуры. Подсем. Podopinae объединяет виды, зимующие в состоянии имагинальной диапаузы, наступление которой регулируется длиной дня и температурой. Все они питаются содержимым семян, и характер их сезонного развития во многом определяется доступностью корма. Однако такой же тип питания и характер сезонного развития свойствен многим видам подсем. Pen-tatominae (в частности большинству представителей трибы Aeliini). Все виды подсем. Asopinae - хищники, два из них, <i>Picromerus bidens </i>и <i>Apateticus cynicus, </i>имеют редко встречающуюся у полужесткокрылых облигатную диапаузу на эмбриональной стадии. Виды эти относятся к разным трибам: <i>P. bidens </i>относится к Platinopini, а <i>A. cynicus </i>- к Amyoteini. В то же время включенные в одну трибу <i>A. cynicus </i>и <i>Podisus maculiventris </i>имеют различные типы диапаузы: облигатная эмбриональная диапауза - у первого вида и факультативная имагинальная - у второго. Для остальных исследованных видов этого подсемейства характерна факультативная имагинальная диапауза, контролируемая длиной дня и температурой. Исключение составляет только <i>Andrallus spinidens, </i>имагинальная диапауза которого регулируется температурой, а реакция на длину дня, возможно, имеет второстепенное значение. Таким образом, несмотря на сходный образ жизни и режим питания видов подсемейства Asopinae (все они хищники), диапауза у них приурочена к различным стадиям, и ее наступление определяется разными факторами. Большинство представителей подсем. Pentatominae, наоборот, несмотря на разнообразие типов питания в пределах фитофагии, зимуют на имагинальной стадии, и наступление диапа-узы них регулируется длиннодневной фотопериодической реакцией. Но и здесь есть отдельные виды с облигатной диапаузой, определяющей моновольтинизм, например <i>Palomena prasina, Palomena angulosa </i>и <i>Menida scotti. </i>У последнего обнаружена необычная особенность: обли-гатную репродуктивную диапаузу имеют только самки, а самцы остаются физиологически активными в течение всей зимовки. Неожиданным кажется сосуществование <i>Pentatoma rufi-pes </i>с облигатной личиночной диапаузой и <i>Nezara viridula </i>с факультативной имагинальной диапаузой в одной трибе Pentatomini. В трибе Aelini среди исследованных видов лишь у <i>Aelia rostrata </i>обнаружена облигатная имагинальная диапауза, а моновольтинный сезонный цикл с эстивацией и выраженными сезонными миграциями вполне идентичен сезонному развитию клопов-черепашек (сем. Scutelleridae). Эволюция сезонных адаптаций у щитников, согласно результатам анализа их сезонного развития, не является непосредственным отражением эволюции филогенетической, но в пределах отдельных родов (например, <i>Palomena </i>с облигатной диапаузой и фотопериодической регуляцией скорости роста личинок или <i>Euschistus </i>c фотопериодически регулируемыми цветовыми формами) и небольших триб (как Aeliini) или даже подсемейств (Podopinae) появляются однотипные комплексы сезонных адаптаций. Наряду с этим существует большое подсемейство Pentatominae, представляющее собой явно сборную, но достаточно однообразную по типу диапаузы - факультативной имагинальной - у большинства входящих в него видов, группу. В целом, несмотря на интенсивное исследование сезонных адаптаций пентатомид и других семейств полужесткокрылых в последние десятилетия, доля видов, изученных в отношении диапаузы и экологических механизмов еt регуляции, остается ничтожной и пока не достигает даже1%отобщего количества известных видов щитников						2	0	3	0	5	0	5			0367-1445			RSCI:17103009		
J	Emmett, RL; Brodeur, RD; Miller, TW; Pool, SS; Krutzikowsky, GK; Bentley, PJ; McCrae, J					Brodeur, Richard/0000-0002-6629-5564			Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) abundance, distribution, and ecological relationships in the Pacific Northwest								CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS				46				122	143						DEC 2005	2005	During the 1930s and 1940s, Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax) supported an important fishery in Pacific Northwest waters, but after their population crashed in the mid-1950s, they were rarely observed in this region. Starting in the mid-1990s, sardines resumed migrating into Northwest waters to spawn and feed. Pacific sardines now support a relatively large purse seine fishery centered off the Columbia River. From 1994 to 1998, we 1 led the abundance and distribution of Pacific sardine eggs and larvae in Northwest waters. The highest egg densities were observed in June 1996. During all years, eggs were associated with surface temperatures between 14 degrees and 15 degrees C. From 1998 to 2004, surface-trawl surveys, primarily on the continental shelf, identified the temporal and spatial distribution and abundance patterns of juvenile and adult Pacific sardines. Adult sardines generally do not over-winter off the Northwest, but migrate north from California in the spring (May-June) when surface temperatures exceed 12 degrees C. However, juvenile sardines over-winter in nearshore coastal waters. During most years, few 0-age juveniles were captured, indicating relatively poor spawning success; however, high densities of 0-age sardines were observed in fall of 2003 and 2004, indicating successful spawning. During the summer, sardines are most abundant on the shelf in cool (<16 degrees C) and high salinity (>30 S) coastal waters, with their highest densities occurring in northern Oregon/Washington waters. Sardines are non-selective planktonic filter feeders; prey include copepods, euphausiids, and phytoplankton. Sardines are important prey of Northwest fishes, such as sharks, salmon, Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and Jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus).									103	0	0	0	72	3	106			0575-3317			WOS:000235967800010		
J	DeVries, Maya S.; Wainwright, Peter C.				Wainwright, Peter/A-7882-2013				The effects of acute temperature change on prey capture kinematics in Largemouth Bass, Micropterus salmoldes								COPEIA					3			437	444						SEP 15 2006	2006	The effects of temperature on prey capture kinematics were investigated in the Largemouth Bass, Micropterus salmoides. Five individuals were first acclimated to 22 C and then acutely exposed to temperatures of 15, 20, 25, and 30 C. At each temperature, feeding events were recorded using high-speed video at 500 frames s(-1). An analysis of variance on the five fastest feeding events from each individual at each temperature resulted in a significant trend for the fastest feeding events to occur at 25 C. This effect confirmed the expectation of thermal dependence of mouth opening movements, which was based on an inverse relationship between water viscosity and temperature and the assumption that temperatures outside optimum decrease muscular power and contraction rates. However, the Q(10) value between 15-25 C was only 1.28, well below the minimum expected value of 2.0. Thus, we suggest the possibility that Largemouth Bass partially compensate for the effects of acute temperature changes by recruiting additional motor units at lower temperatures. The capacity of Largemouth Bass to mitigate the impact of acute temperature change on muscle physiology and the physical properties of water may represent a physiological adaptation to a predatory lifestyle in a thermally variable environment.									12	0	0	0	13	0	13			0045-8511	1938-5110		WOS:000240652400012

The correlation between these variables and the aggregations of each sex was low. A priori juvenile males and females were not highly discriminated by any of these environmental variables (depth, temperature and salinity) based on a multivariate analysis. The best discriminated groups were the new recruits, and depth and longitude were the variables that contributed most to their segregation, while adult males had some preference for shallower and warm waters. Diet composition varied with body size but it was quite similar in both sexes among which no significant differences were observed. An increase in feeding intensity and abundance of Euphasiacea prey taxa was found in adult females compared to males.									30	0	0	0	29	0	33			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000245813000018		
J	Svensson, JE								Sex differences in habitat distribution of a planktonic copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis								ECOGRAPHY				20	4			407	416		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00386.x				AUG 1997	1997	The spatial distribution of adult males and females in a population of the copepod Eudiaptomus gracilis was studied throughout one year. The sexes were markedly segregated in spring and under ice in late winter. This skewed distribution was mainly due to a strong concentration of females in deep water in the lake centre. Males were more evenly distributed but dominated in relative terms strongly over females near the surface and the littoral zone. Among females, those carrying eggs were most concentrated in deep regions. Also during summer, females in the lake centre showed a marked abundance peak in deep water but the distribution of egg-carrying females did not differ from ether females. During autumn and early winter, differences in the distribution of the sexes were minor. The distribution of the sexes is discussed in relation to predators, temperature, food, and mates. Female copepods are susceptible to fish predation when carrying eggs. Fish may contribute to the over-representation of females in deep regions by eating or scaring away this category of vulnerable prey from littoral areas and from the surface waters. The fish predation hypothesis does not accurately predict the seasonal occurrence of the skewed distribution, however. Feeding rate of fish is most likely low under ice. Reproductive advantages in the warmer deep water may have contributed to female choice of habitat in late winter. In spring and late winter proportionally fewer females near the surface and shore carried eggs, but they carried more spermatophores. This indicates that these females were more receptive to matings. Phytoplankton biomass was higher near the surface. Thus, males may have gained mating advantages and more food by avoiding deep water in the centre of the lake.									10	0	0	0	7	1	10			0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:A1997XN46600010

Based on calculations of indexes of relative importance of different food items we aimed at identification of diet overlaps, which define the resource competition between anchovy juveniles and Mnemiopsis. In the summer diets of both predatory groups the cladocerans' representative Penilia avirostris dominates (55%-70%). The average daily ratio of ctenophores represents 0.73% of body weight in summer 2003-2004, whereas it is 17.87% of body weight for anchovy. The ctenophore predation rate amounts to 2.31-3.74% of the daily mesozooplankton C-biomass with maximum of 6.45%, which reveals mitigated pressure on zooplankton community exerted by M. leidyi during the investigated period.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0324-0770			WOS:000264562500034

Olfactory information is crucial for risk assessment in aquatic organisms as predators release odours when they capture prey that lead to an alarm response in conspecific prey. Recent studies show some coral reef fishes are unable to use alarm odours when surrounded by dead-degraded coral. Our study examines the spatial and temporal dynamics of this alarm odour-nullifying effect, and which substratum types may be responsible. Field experiments showed that settlement-stage damselfish were not able to detect alarm odours within 2 m downcurrent of degraded coral, and that the antipredator response was re-established 20-40 min after transferral to live coral. Laboratory experiments indicate that the chemicals from common components of the degraded habitats, the cyanobacteria, Okeania sp., and diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia sp.prevented an alarm odour response. The same nullifying effect was found for the common red algae, Galaxauria robusta, suggesting that the problem is of a broader nature than previously realised. Those fish species best able to compensate for a lack of olfactory risk information at key times will be those potentially most resilient to the effects of coral degradation that operate through this mechanism.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			2045-2322			WOS:000417050200027	29208978

Study of these as well as recently re-organized collections from Mary Leakey's 1972 HWK EE excavations here provides a synthetic view of the faunal community of Olduvai during Middle Bed II at similar to 1.7-1.4 Ma, an interval that captures the local transition from Oldowan to Acheulean technology. We expand the faunal list for this interval, name a new bovid species, clarify the evolution of several mammalian lineages, and record new local first and last appearances. Compositions of the fish and large mammal assemblages support previous indications for the dominance of open and seasonal grassland habitats at the margins of an alkaline lake. Fish diversity is low and dominated by cichlids, which indicates strongly saline conditions. The taphonomy of the fish assemblages supports reconstructions of fluctuating lake levels with mass die-offs in evaporating pools. The mammals are dominated by grazing bovids and equids. Habitats remained consistently dry and open throughout the entire Bed II sequence, with no major turnover or paleoecological changes taking place. Rather, wooded and wet habitats had already given way to drier and more open habitats by the top of Bed I, at 1.85-1.80 Ma. This ecological change is close to the age of the Oldowan-Acheulean transition in Kenya and Ethiopia, but precedes the local transition in Middle Bed II.The Middle Bed II large mammal community is much richer in species and includes a much larger number of large-bodied species (>300 kg) than the modern Serengeti. This reflects the severity of Pleistocene extinctions on African large mammals, with the loss of large species fitting a pattern typical of defaunation or 'downsizing' by human disturbance. However, trophic network (food web) analyses show that the Middle Bed II community was robust, and comparisons with the Serengeti community indicate that the fundamental structure of food webs remained intact despite Pleistocene extinctions. The presence of a generalized meateating hominin in the Middle Bed II community would have increased competition among carnivores and vulnerability among herbivores, but the high generality and interconnectedness of the Middle Bed II food web suggests this community was buffered against extinctions caused by trophic interactions.

Distribution and habitat switching was measured with bimonthly bottom-trawl surveys repeated throughout the summer. Patterns of daily growth increments on otoliths were used to measure the history of habitat residence, individual size at the time of the habitat switch, and habitat-specific growth rates. Laboratory experiments and known-age fish confirmed daily increment formation of otoliths. After dispersing during an initial pelagic larval stage, postlarval juveniles settled in both the warm, food-rich littoral zone and the cold, unproductive profundal zone. During summer, initial profundal-zone inhabitants underwent a unidirectional habitat shift to the more productive littoral zone. Fish that moved to the littoral zone grew twice as fast as those in the profundal zone and encountered little apparent predation mortality risk there. Habitat shifts were therefore consistent with both growth optimization and predatory avoidance. However, shifts occurred at a wide range of body sizes throughout the summer. The large spatial scale of the lake, limited swimming ability of juvenile fish, diel migratory behavior, and lack of complex habitat structure may preclude shifts at discrete body sizes for this species.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0002-8487			WOS:000089184000015

A review of Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) studies in the Kongsfjorden area, Svalbard Norway								POLAR BIOLOGY				39	11	SI		2169	2178		10.1007/s00300-016-1949-3				NOV 2016	2016	Herein, we review and synthesize results from a series of research projects that were conducted to evaluate the role of Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) in the marine ecosystem in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Norway. A total of 76 sharks were caught on baited lines during the summers of 2008 and 2009 for these investigations. All of these animals, including the largest shark, a female weighing 700 kg, were sexually immature. Approximately half of the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs, N = 33) examined contained seal tissue (42.3 %), and some also contained minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) tissue (18.2 %). Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) were the dominant fish species consumed by the sharks. These fish species were found in 39.4, 18.2 and 18.2 % of the GITs, respectively. Many of the fishes were swallowed whole, including an Atlantic wolffish weighing 8.6 kg. Satellite pop-up tags deployed on 20 of the sharks showed that they travelled in the water column from the surface to depths greater than 1500 m, encountering temperatures from -1.5A degrees to 7.4A degrees. Accelerometers deployed on six of the sharks showed that they swim extremely slowly, with average speeds of 0.34 m/s and burst speeds of only twice this value. Various types of circumstantial evidence, including the condition of the seals and fishes found in the sharks' stomachs, indicate that they are not only scavengers, but also active predators of both fish and mammalian prey. Given the swim speed of these sharks, we suggest that the only way they could successfully capture a healthy seal is via cryptically approaching seals that are asleep in the water. Greenland sharks clearly play a significant role as large predators in the Kongsfjorden marine ecosystem, a fact that has been largely overlooked until recently.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000390030500018		
J	Kokubun, Nobuo; Yamamoto, Takashi; Sato, Nobuhiko; Watanuki, Yutaka; Will, Alexis; Kitaysky, Alexander S.; Takahashi, Akinori								Foraging segregation of two congeneric diving seabird species breeding on St. George Island, Bering Sea								BIOGEOSCIENCES				13	8			2579	2591		10.5194/bg-13-2579-2016				2016	2016	Subarctic environmental changes are expected to affect the foraging ecology of marine top predators, but the response to such changes may vary among species if they use food resources differently. We examined the characteristics of foraging behavior of two sympatric congeneric diving seabird: common (Uria aalge: hereafter COMUs) and thick-billed (U. lomvia: hereafter TBMUs) murres breeding on St. George Island, located in the seasonal sea-ice region of the Bering Sea. We investigated their foraging trip and flight durations, diel patterns of dive depth, and underwater wing strokes, along with wing morphology and blood stable isotope signatures and stress hormones. Acceleration-temperature-depth loggers were attached to chick-guarding birds, and data were obtained from 7 COMUs and 12 TBMUs. Both species showed similar mean trip duration (13.2 h for COMUs and 10.5 h for TBMUs) and similar diurnal patterns of diving (frequent dives to various depths in the daytime and less frequent dives to shallow depths in the night-time). During the daytime, the dive depths of COMUs had two peaks in shallow (18.1 m) and deep (74.2 m) depths, while those of TBMUs were 20.2 m and 59.7 m. COMUs showed more frequent wing strokes during the bottom phase of dives (1.90 s(-1)) than TBMUs (1.66 s(-1)). Fish occurred more frequently in the bill loads of COMUs (85 %) than those of TBMUs (56 %). The delta N-15 value of blood was significantly higher in COMUs (14.5 parts per thousand) than in TBMUs (13.1 parts per thousand). The relatively small wing area (0.053 m(2)) of COMUs compared to TBMUs (0.067 m(2)) may facilitate their increased agility while foraging and allow them to capture more mobile prey such as larger fishes that inhabit deeper depths. These differences in food resource use may lead to the differential responses of the two murre species to marine environmental changes in the Bering Sea.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000377276700023

This study examined the independent and combined effects of short-term exposure to elevated CO, and boat noise on the predator prey interactions of a pair of common coral reef fishes (Pomacentrus wardi and its predator, Pseudochromis fuscus). Successful capture of prey by predators was the same regardless of whether the pairs had been exposed to ambient control conditions, the addition of either playback of boat noise, elevated CO2 (925 mu atm) or both stressors simultaneously. The kinematics of the interaction were the same for all stressor combinations and differed from the controls. The effects of CO2 or boat noise were the same, suggesting that their effects were substitutive in this situation. Prey reduced their perception of threat under both stressors individually and when combined, and this coincided with reduced predator attack distances and attack speeds. The lack of an additive or multiplicative effect when both stressors co-occurred was notable given the different mechanisms involved in sensory disruptions and highlights the importance of determining the combined effects of key drivers to aid in predicting community dynamics under future environmental scenarios.									6	1	0	0	5	0	7			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000428940600006	29563262

We assessed the diel vertical migrationDVM(UV/predation-avoidance strategy), numerical response, and starvation resistance (physiological strategies to cope with food scarcity) of the copepod Leptodiaptomus garciai and the rotifers Hexarthra jenkinae and Brachionus sp. Mexico, which constitute the zooplankton assemblage of Alchichica, a high-altitude, deep, oligotrophic, hyposaline, warm-monomictic lake located in Mexico. L. garciai followed the normal pattern of DVM in all seasons; with organisms concentrated approximate to 20 m deeper than the depth of 1% photosynthetically active radiation at mid-day, with evasion from the planktivore Poblana alchichica as the most probable driver. However, copepods could not evade the euphotic zone owing to the anoxic conditions of the hypolimnion during the well-established stratification period. Rotifers did not migrate vertically. The dominance of copepods throughout the year can be explained by their low food threshold, high proportion of usable reserves and the lowest rate of mass loss at food deprivation. Contrastingly, rotifers are scarce and intermittent due to frequent resource limitation and because they lose mass at higher rates. However, they are able to suddenly increase due to their high growth rates. We demonstrated that the interaction between environmental constraints and the specific combinations of traits can explain zooplankton structure in the lake. This study enlightens the necessity to improve current limnological models with data from tropical lakes.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000363888400022

Great Lakes lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) have demonstrated dramatic changes in growth and life history traits since the appearance of dreissenid mussels in the Great Lakes, but the role of habitat occupancy in driving these changes is poorly understood. To better understand temporal changes in lake whitefish depth of capture (D-w), we compiled a database of fishery-independent surveys representing multiple populations across all five Laurentian Great Lakes. By demonstrating the importance of survey design in estimating D, we describe a novel method for detecting survey-based bias in D-w and removing potentially biased data. Using unbiased D-w estimates, we show clear differences in the pattern and timing of changes in lake whitefish D-w between our reference sites (Lake Superior) and those that have experienced significant benthic food web changes (lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario). Lake whitefish D-w in Lake Superior tended to gradually shift to shallower waters, but changed rapidly in other locations coincident with dreissenid establishment and declines in Diporeia densities. Almost all lake whitefish populations that were exposed to dreissenids demonstrated deeper D-w following benthic food web change, though a subset of these populations subsequently shifted to more shallow depths. In some cases in lakes Huron and Ontario, shifts towards more shallow D-w are occurring well after documented Diporeia collapse, suggesting the role of other drivers such as habitat availability or reliance on alternative prey sources.

Two important nursery grounds for these species juveniles have been identified in the Tagus estuary, one in the upper part of the estuary (nursery A) and another in the south bank (nursery B). While S. solea is only present at the uppermost nursery area, S. senegalensis is present at both nurseries. Although they are among the most important predators in these nursery grounds, there are no estimates on their food consumption or on the carrying capacity of the system for soles. The Elliott and Persson [1978. The estimation of daily rates of food consumption for fish. Journal of Animal Ecology 47, 977-993] model was used to estimate food consumption of both species juveniles in both nursery areas, taking into account gastric evacuation rates (previously determined) and 24 h sampling surveys, based on beam-trawl catches carried out every 3 h, in the summer of 1995. Monthly beam trawls were performed to determine sole densities over the summer. Density estimates and daily food consumption values were used to calculate total consumption over the summer period. Sediment samples were taken for the estimation of prey densities and total biomass in the nursery areas. Daily food consumption was lower for S. solea (0.030 g wet weight d(-1)) than for S. senegalensis (0.075 g wet weight d(-1)). It was concluded that thermal stress may be an important factor hindering S. solea's food consumption in the warmer months. Total consumption of S. solea over the summer (90 clays) was estimated to be 97 kg (wet weight). Solea senegalensis total consumption in nursery A was estimated to be 103 kg, while in nursery B it was 528 kg. Total prey biomass estimated for nursery A was 300 tonnes, while for nursery B it was 58 tonnes. This suggests that food is not a limiting factor for sole in the Tagus estuary. However it was concluded that more in-depth studies into the food consumption of other species and prey availability are needed in order to determine the carrying capacity of this system for sole juveniles.

However, it is unclear if increased mortality results from changes in the dynamics of predator-prey interactions or due to prey increasing activity levels. Here we demonstrate that ocean pCO(2) projected to occur by 2100 significantly effects the interactions of a predator-prey pair of common reef fish: the planktivorous damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis and the piscivorous dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 (880 mu atm) or a present-day control (440 matm) interacted with similarly exposed predators in a cross-factored design. Predators had the lowest capture success when exposed to elevated CO2 and interacting with prey exposed to present-day CO2. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 had reduced escape distances and longer reaction distances compared to prey exposed to present-day CO2 conditions, but this was dependent on whether the prey was paired with a CO2 exposed predator or not. This suggests that the dynamics of predator-prey interactions under future CO2 environments will depend on the extent to which the interacting species are affected and can adapt to the adverse effects of elevated CO2.									69	2	0	0	65	0	71			1932-6203			WOS:000316936100120	23484032

We hypothesized that the dynamics of movements powered by elastic recoil have a lower thermal dependence than muscle-powered movements. We examined the prey capture behavior of toads (Bufo terrestris) using high speed imaging and electromyography to compare the effects of body temperature (11-35 degrees C) on the kinematics, dynamics and motor control of two types of movement: (1) ballistic mouth opening and tongue projection, which are powered by elastic recoil, and (2) non-ballistic prey transport, including tongue retraction and mouth closing, which are powered directly by muscle contraction. Over 11-25 degrees C, temperature coefficients of ballistic mouth opening and tongue projection dynamics (Q(10) of 0.99-1.25) were not significantly different from 1.00 and were consistently lower than those of prey transport movements (Q(10) of 1.77-2.26), supporting our main hypothesis. The depressor mandibulae muscle, which is responsible for ballistic mouth opening and tongue projection via the recovery of elastic strain energy stored by the muscle prior to the onset of the movement, was activated earlier and for a longer duration at lower temperatures (Q(10) of 2.29-2.41), consistent with a slowing of its contractile rates. Muscle recruitment was unaffected by temperature, as revealed by the lack of thermal dependence in the intensity of activity of both the jaw depressor and jaw levator muscles (Q(10) of 0.754-1.12). Over the 20-35 degrees C range, lower thermal dependence was found for the dynamics of non-elastic movements and the motor control of both elastic and non-elastic movements, in accord with a plateau of high performance found in other systems.									28	0	0	0	28	0	29			0022-0949			WOS:000288696500020	21430211

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 424 pp.) has been adapted to describe the dynamics of growth and reproduction of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared in different areas under conditions ranging from controlled to natural. The values of the model parameters were estimated from available physiological data and from published information. The sets of data used to validate the model came from three long-term growth experiments (> 5 months) performed on Pacific oysters reared under different conditions of food and environment. The forcing variables were temperature and phytoplankton densities, the latter being assessed from in vivo fluorescence and chlorophyll-a concentration measurement. The successful validation of the model on the three data sets demonstrated its ability to capture the dynamics of the energy budget in the Pacific oyster in various environments with the same set of parameters. The only parameter that varied between simulations was the half-saturation coefficient (X(K)), because of a different diet composition between the three environments under test. The model successfully reproduced quantitatively the growth and reproduction and the timing of spawning.

J	CRAIG, NI								GROWTH OF THE BIVALVE NUCULA-ANNULATA IN NUTRIENT-ENRICHED ENVIRONMENTS								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				104	1-2			77	90		10.3354/meps104077				JAN 1994	1994	Measured changes in shell length and in the oxygen isotopic composition of shell growth bands were used to determine growth rates and season of maximum growth of the bivalve mollusc Nucula annulata from unstressed and nutrient-enriched environments in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA). Clams from unenriched environments grew between 0.55 and 0.9 mm yr(-1). Significant growth was limited to temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees C, in late spring and early fall. Populations in unstressed environments were dominated by high abundances of small clams (< 1 mm in length). Populations from nutrient-enriched environments consisted of fewer, larger clams. Data from a 2.3 yr nutrient gradient experiment and a 2 mo growth experiment suggest the larger individuals are simply older clams rarely found in unenriched environments. delta(18)O temperature values from shell growth bands indicated a shift in the season of maximum growth from spring to summer for clams in eutrophic environments. Peak spawning activity of N. annulata usually coincides with the summer maxima in temperature (22 degrees C) in Narragansett Bay, The low numbers of juveniles found in enriched environments coupled with warmer shell growth temperatures imply a decline in successful reproduction and/or recruitment in eutrophic areas. Deteriorating environmental conditions associated with nutrient enrichment, i.e. low water column oxygen levels, may also enhance the survivorship of older, larger N. annulata possible through a reduction in predation pressure.									17	0	0	0	12	1	17			0171-8630			WOS:A1994MV23900007

Due to predation and competition, biological invaders can cause extinctions and imperil the status of native species, and this phenomenon is enhanced by habitat alteration, for example, dam construction. In addition to river fragmentation caused by dam construction, the impact of non-native species migrating from reservoirs on native assemblages in their tributaries should be considered from a long-term perspective. The present study focused on asp (Leuciscus aspius), an artificially introduced piscivorous cyprinid that became established in the Lipno Reservoir (Czech Republic). Asp regularly occur in a tributary, the Vltava River, where twenty-five individuals were captured, radio-tagged, and tracked for five consecutive years. Asp occurrence in the tributary was highest during spring due to the upstream migration of spawning fish, and this was interconnected with a movement activity peak in March when the temperature reached 6 degrees C. The fish migrated a maximum distance of 31 km, and the probability of asp occurrence in the tributary was sex-dependent, with more females than males. Some individuals occupied the Vltava River not only for spawning but remained until the temperatures dropped below 10 degrees C. This study shows how non-native predators use reservoirs for wintering but feed and spawn in tributaries.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2073-4441			WOS:000475346300194

We explored hypoxia's influence on two pelagic zooplanktivores in Lake Erie that have different thermal preferences: cold-water rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and warm-water emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides). To assess acute effects, we combined predictive bioenergetics-based modeling with field collections made across the hypoxic season in central Lake Erie during 2005 and 2007. To assess chronic effects, we related fishery-independent and fishery-dependent catches with hypoxia severity and top predator (walleye, Sander vitreus) abundance during 1986-2014. As our modeling predicted, hypoxia altered rainbow smelt movement and distributions, leading to avoidance of cold, hypoxic bottom waters. In response, diets shifted from benthic to pelagic organisms, and consumption and energetic condition declined. These changes were lacking in emerald shiners. Our long-term analyses showed rainbow smelt abundance and hypoxia to be negatively related and suggested that hypoxia avoidance increases susceptibility to commercial fishing and walleye predation. Collectively, our findings indicate that hypoxia can negatively affect pelagic fish populations over the long term, especially those requiring cold water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000543742600003

This rotifer is grown between 20 and 25 degreesC (its optimal growth temperature) and then introduced into the 10 degreesC water in which larvae are reared. The rapid thermal difference between the two media is thought to reduce B. plicatilis quality and consequently affect larval rearing efficiency. In order to optimize larval rearing, a study was conducted to compare the effects of two different diets on larval growth performance and nutritional condition: (1) larvae fed B. plicatilis reared at 24 degreesC and (2) larvae fed B. plicatifis reared at 24 degreesC but acclimated overnight at 10 degreesC. Comparisons were undertaken using morphometric measurements, nucleic acid (RNA/DNA) ratios, total protein content, trypsin activity, and triacylglycerol/sterol ratios. Fatty acid composition of larvae was also studied with a focus on the levels and ratios of three essential fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid or DHA, cicosapentaenoic acid or EPA, and arachidonic acid or AA). Unique information regarding trypsin activity and lipid components (phospholipid, triacylglycerol, and sterol) of winter flounder larvae is provided in this study. Trypsin activity was detected very early in larvae and was not affected by acclimation of prey. Phospholipid, triacylglycerol, and sterol composition showed no significant difference between the two diets tested and was characterized by high phospholipid content as well as low triacylglycerol and sterol contents. EPA, DHA, AA, DHA/EPA, and DHA/ AA decreased from days 12 to 26. Interestingly, DHA content was significantly higher in larvae fed acclimated rotifers and AA content decreased significantly in 26-day-old larvae fed acclimated B. plicatilis. Overall, results indicate that overnight acclimation of B. plicatilis at 10 degreesC is not important for optimizing the rearing of winter flounder larvae although it does influence the fatty acid composition.

J	Engelbrecht, Derek								Galagos as avian nest predators in South Africa								PRIMATES				57	4			455	458		10.1007/s10329-016-0559-6				OCT 2016	2016	Galagos are generally regarded as dietary specialists that feed predominantly on insects and gum. The diet of the thick-tailed greater galago is more varied and also includes fruit and small vertebrates, although the latter is rare and restricted to certain populations. The southern lesser galago is seemingly a more specialist forager, but frugivory was recently reported in two separate populations, suggesting at least some dietary plasticity in this species. The species is not known to consume vertebrates. Here I report on observations of avian nest predation by both thick-tailed greater and southern lesser galagos in Roodewal State Forest Reserve in South Africa. Galagos were responsible for 56 % of nest losses captured on trail cameras. Both species consumed eggs and nestlings of six species of passerines ranging in size from recently hatched to similar to 30 g nestlings almost ready to fledge. The consumption of vertebrates by the southern lesser galago represents an extension of its diet, as this has not been reported before. The results suggest that eggs and nestlings comprise part of the regular diet of thick-tailed greater galagos in the study area, albeit only seasonal. The consumption of vertebrate prey by southern lesser galagos may represent the expression of latent behavior which is only expressed under certain environmental conditions, e.g., a severe drought, when its regular food base may be diminished.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0032-8332	1610-7365		WOS:000384579100004	27503202

We addressed two research questions in this study: (i) Does the relative abundance of individual copepod species life history stages differ across warm and cold periods and (ii) Do estimated secondary production rates for copepods differ across warm and cold periods? For most copepod species, warmer conditions resulted in increased abundances in May, the opposite was observed in colder conditions. Abundances of smaller-sized copepod species did not differ significantly between the warm and cold periods, whereas abundances of larger-sized Calanus spp. increased during the cold period during July and September. Estimated secondary production rates in the warm period were highest in May for smaller-sized copepods; production in the cold period was dominated by the larger-sized Calanus spp. in July and September. We hypothesize that these observed patterns are a function of temperature-driven changes in phenology combined with shifts in size-based trophic relationships with primary producers. Based on this hypothesis, we present a conceptual model that builds upon the Oscillating Control Hypothesis to explain how variability in copepod production links to pollock variability. Specifically, fluctuations in spring sea-ice drive regime-dependent copepod production over the southeastern Bering Sea, but greatest impacts to upper trophic levels are driven by cascading July/September differences in copepod production.									12	0	0	0	5	0	12			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000424893400004

Growth rates of colonies (number of polyps and number of buds in the colony) and individuals (number of buds per active scyphistomae) significantly increased with temperature, but were not affected by salinity. Survival was high in all treatment combinations indicating a wide tolerance to environmental conditions. However, scyphistomae at the lowest temperature had a greater percentage of larger individuals and slower population growth rate than those at warmer temperatures. These results suggest that the reproductive strategy to maximise production of Aurelia sp. is to increase the size of scyphistomae colonies by asexual budding when conditions are good (warmer temperatures and abundant food generally during spring and summer). Budding activity slows, but the size of scyphistomae increases, during the colder winter period leading up to strobilation, resulting in the production of a greater number of ephyrae. The trigger for strobilation is possibly stressful conditions. However, if trigger conditions do not occur, the colony of scyphistomae can continue to grow and survive through a broad range of conditions spanning many seasons, thus ensuring survival of the population.

J	Donohoe, CJ								Age, growth, distribution, and food habits of recently settled white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, off San Diego County, California								FISHERY BULLETIN				95	4			709	721						OCT 1997	1997	White seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, is a valuable recreational and commercial species, but much of its early life history is undescribed. The coast and two bays of San Diego County were sampled each month for two years with a depth-stratified sampling design to determine habitat, food habits, age, and growth rate of recently settled fish. Age was estimated from otolith increments and validated with fish of known age, reared in the laboratory. A few recently settled fish were caught in the bays at depths <1 m, but most inhabited shallow water (4-8 m) along the coast from May to October. This depth distribution coincides with that of the mysid Metamysidopsis elongata. Fish abundance in this zone was low, however, reaching a maximum of 24/ha in July. The smallest white seabass collected were about 7 mm SL and 26 d old, but previous studies indicate that smaller and presumably younger fish were probably extruded through the trawl. According to combined results, most larvae settled 2-3 weeks after being spawned. Juveniles remained at a depth of 4-8 m for 2-3 months, fed primarily on abundant mysids, and associated with drifting macrophytes (r=0.52, P=0.015, n=21). Growth during this period was 1.3 mm/d, similar to that observed in the laboratory. At about 100 mm SL (similar to 100 d old), juveniles appeared to move out of the area. The shallow waters just beyond the breaking waves may be preferred by young white seabass because abundant food and warm water promote rapid growth and drifting macrophytes provide a refuge from predators.									11	0	0	0	13	0	13			0090-0656	1937-4518		WOS:A1997YA86300007

This marine flatworm is one of the most common polyclads within warm temperate to tropical west Atlantic, yet it has been misidentified consistently as a pseudocerotid. Animals were kept alive in the laboratory for 3 weeks for biological observations. Findings indicated that these euryleptids employ hypodermic insemination, with multiple copulations occurring over several days. Sperm was transferred in sperm bundles bilaterally with little apparent damage to the epidermis of the copulating worms. Copulation sessions were variable and lasted an average of 15.4 min. In situ and laboratory observations indicated that M. crozieri fed exclusively on the mangrove ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata Herdman, 1880, an individual consuming one prey zooid in an average of 17 min and an average of 19 zooids over 24 h.									25	0	0	0	23	0	26			0022-2933			WOS:000087397700001

Many studies addressed the long-term effects of mammalian grazing on insect herbivores, yet few examined the effects during grazing (or right after it takes place). We investigated the immediate and long-term effects of cattle grazing on the abundance and distribution of the herbivorous spring webworm caterpillar (Ocnogyna loewii), via excluding cattle (by fencing) within a grazed paddock. In addition, we estimated the caterpillar density in replicated grazed and non-grazed paddocks (maintained as so for dozens of years), in moderate and heavy grazing intensities. Since the caterpillars develop during the cold winter months, we predicted that cattle grazing would positively affect them by reducing plant height and increasing their exposure to direct warm sunlight. Therefore, we examined caterpillar preference for sun-exposed areas using shade-manipulation experiments. Overall, cattle grazing positively affected the caterpillars, increasing their numbers two-fold on average, regardless of grazing intensity. This effect was immediate, as the caterpillars rapidly responded to exclusion of cattle by moving away from non-grazed areas. Caterpillar growth rate was similar when feeding on grazed and non-grazed vegetation. Most caterpillars (over 80%) preferred sun over manipulated shaded microhabitats. Furthermore, we found that cattle usually do not ingest caterpillars while feeding. Cattle grazing likely benefited the caterpillars that develop under low temperatures by reducing plant cover, thus creating a warmer habitat. This study demonstrates how changes in vegetation structure caused by mammalian herbivores can rapidly and positively affect the abundance and distribution of herbivorous insects.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000432511600005

However, these habitats are highly threatened by anthropogenic activities, such as land-use changes, the introduction of exotic species, and global warming. Further understanding on the spatiotemporal use of wetlands and their surrounding areas by migrating birds is essential to predict how these changes might affect avian en route ecology. We selected a habitat-generalist passerine, the Bluethroat Luscinia svecica, as model of how migratory birds exploit a highly anthropogenic river basin in southwestern France (i.e. Barthes de la Nive) during autumn migration. We captured and radiotracked 29 young Bluethroats in this region to shed light on different aspects of their stopover ecology and behavior such as stopover duration, habitat selection, and home-range size. We also characterized Bluethroat diet and arthropod availability in different habitats. Bluethroats positively selected pure or mixed reed beds (associated with sedge), hydrophilous tall grasslands, and corn crops. Birds staying more than one day, 8.4 days on average, used preferably corn crops. Home-range sizes were on average 5.8 ha (fixed kernels K95) and high-occupancy area (K50) was 1.36 ha with large individual variation. Bluethroats stopping over with low fuel loads tended to have larger home ranges and used preferentially corn crops, wet, or mesotrophic grasslands and rural paths. Reed beds were typically used as roosting habitat for the majority of birds, being on average 397 m apart from their daytime core areas. Short-staying birds tended to show higher fuel loads and restricted their activities to a smaller home range (1 ha) in pure and mixed reed beds. The diet of Bluethroats was dominated by ants, spiders, and beetles that were particularly abundant in corn crops. The use of corn crops by autumn-migrating Bluethroats in our study site seems to be a reasonable solution in a highly altered environment. Reducing the use of insecticides in these crops and delaying the harvesting time after mid-October are two supplemental measures that, together with a good management of the remaining wetland patches, could greatly favor Bluethroats and other migratory species in this region.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2193-7192	2193-7206		WOS:000511854700008

The two specialist predators are part of a biological control program for A. tsugae, and the potential for competition among these species and previously established generalist predators in the field is unknown.2 Adult predators were evaluated in branch cages during spring and summer at two field sites infested with A. tsugae. Using females only in 2003 and sexual pairs in 2004, predator survival and net reproduction were examined, as well as their feeding and impact on A. tsugae when present alone and in conspecific and heterospecific groupings.3 Predator survival was not affected by the presence of additional predators. Total feeding was greater for all species when placed in predator groupings, suggesting that interactions do not significantly interfere with feeding activity. Net reproduction per predator was negatively affected by conspecifics, but unaffected by heterospecifics, indicating that direct or indirect intraspecific interference may occur. In spring, L. nigrinus showed the greatest impact on A. tsugae, and H. axyridis had the greatest impact during summer.4 These results suggest that it would be beneficial to utilize multiple predator species combinations over single species when implementing biological control for A. tsugae. Low-density releases are also recommended to reduce intraspecific interference.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000240172900008

In this study two long-term data sets on summer diets of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in international waters of the central North Pacific Ocean (CNP; 19912009) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA; 19932002) were evaluated to identify potential drivers of steelhead productivity in the North Pacific. Stable isotopes of steelhead muscle tissue were assessed to corroborate the results of stomach content analysis. We found the composition of steelhead diets varied by ocean age group, region, and year. In both the GOA and CNP, gonatid squid (Berryteuthis anonychus) were the most influential component of steelhead diets, leading to higher prey energy densities and stomach fullness. Stomach contents during an exceptionally warm year in the GOA and CNP (1997) were characterized by high diversity of prey with low energy density, few squid, and a large amount of potentially toxic debris (e.g., plastic). Indicators of good diets (high proportions of squid and high prey energy density) were negatively correlated with abundance of wild populations of eastern Kamchatka pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the CNP. In conclusion, interannual variations in climate, abundance of squid, and density-dependent interactions with highly-abundant stocks of pink salmon were identified as potential key drivers of steelhead productivity in these ecosystems. Additional research in genetic stock identification is needed to link these potential drivers of productivity to individual populations.									10	0	0	0	11	0	12			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000306736000001

In this analysis, we complement previous studies on possible causes of this decline by considering a suite of environmental parameters, potential change in predation pressure, and post-smolt growth. Marine survival estimates were found to be negatively correlated with temperature, indicating that warming conditions have not favoured survival. Survival was also found to be positively correlated with dissolved oxygen levels and regionally related to shifts in salinity. These relationships were further studied in context to the potential predation on post-smolts by one of the main piscivores in the Baltic, Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias). Concomitant with changes in environmental conditions, Baltic cod has changed its latitudinal range, moving northward in the Baltic, possibly in response to warming conditions. These changes lead us to hypothesize that predation pressure on salmon may have increased in recent years as cod has now occupied habitats used by salmon post-smolts during their southward feeding migrations. This predation may have been intensified as a result of anoxic conditions in the central basin by concentrating predation interactions in coastal waters and/or the upper water column typically occupied by salmon post-smolts. Indicators of post-smolt growth were applied to test the alternate hypothesis that mortality is growth-mediated; these indicators lacked a time series trend, which supports the contention that shifting predation pressure rather than feeding opportunities is responsible for the decline in post-smolt survival in Baltic salmon.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000404450700011

The Acropora coral-eating flatworm (AEFW), Prosthiostomum acroporae (Platyhelminthes: Polycladida: Prosthiostomidae) feeds on wild and cultivated Acropora species and its inadvertent introduction into reef tanks can lead to the rapid death of coral colonies. To guide the treatment of infested corals we investigated the flatworm's life cycle parameters at a range of temperatures that represent those found in reef tanks, coral aquaculture facilities and seasonal fluctuations in the wild. We utilized P. acroporae from a long-term in vivo culture on Acropora species to examine the effects of temperature (3 degrees C increments from 21 to 30 degrees C) on flatworm embryonation period, hatching success, hatchling longevity, and time to sexual maturity. Our findings show that warmer seawater shortened generation times; at 27 degrees C it took, on average, 11 days for eggs to hatch, and 35 days for flatworms to reach sexual maturity, giving a minimum generation time of 38 days, whereas at 24 degrees C the generation time was 64 days. Warmer seawater (24-30 degrees C) also increased egg hatching success compared to cooler conditions (21 degrees C). These results indicate that warmer temperatures lead to higher population densities of P. acroporae. Temperature significantly increased the growth rate of P. acroporae, with individuals reaching a larger size at sexual maturity in warmer temperatures, but it did not influence hatchling longevity. Hatchlings, which can swim as well as crawl, can survive between 0.25 and 9 days in the absence of Acropora, and could therefore disperse between coral colonies and inter-connected aquaria. We used our data to predict embryonation duration and time to sexual maturity at 21-30 degrees C, and discuss how to optimize current treatments to disrupt the flatworm's life cycle in captivity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2296-7745		WOS:000483814000001

Using a dryland-vegetation model for plant species that display different tradeoffs between fast growth and tolerance to droughts, we find that ecosystems subjected to strong seasonal variability, typical for drylands, exhibit a temporal period-doubling route to chaos that results in early collapse to bare soil. We further find that fast-growing plants go through period doubling sooner and span wider chaotic ranges than stress-tolerant plants. We propose the detection of period-doubling signatures in power spectra as early indicators of ecosystem collapse that outperform existing indicators in their ability to warn against climate extremes and capture the heightened vulnerability of newly-formed drylands. The proposed indicator is expected to apply to other types of ecosystems, such as consumer-resource and predator-prey systems. We conclude by delineating the conditions ecosystems should meet in order for the proposed indicator to apply.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000508872700023	31862940

Disentangling the processes and determinants that cause these traits to vary helps to understand species' responses to changing environments. This is particularly urgent for exploited populations, where size-selective harvest can induce life-history evolution. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are an exploited fish with a life history adapted to low-productivity freshwaters of northern North America, which makes them highly vulnerable to ecosystem changes and overfishing. We characterized life-history variation across a broad and diverse landscape for this iconic northern freshwater fish and evaluated whether clinal variation was consistent with hypotheses for local adaptation or growth plasticity. We estimated growth-associated traits for 90 populations exposed to a diversity of environments using a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model. We tested for clinal variation in their somatic growth, size at maturity and reproductive allocation along environmental gradients of lake productivity, climate, prey and exploitation clines under competing hypotheses of plasticity and local adaptation. Clinal life-history variation was consistent with growth plasticity and local adaptations but not harvest-induced evolution. Variation in somatic growth was explained by exploitation, climate and prey fish occurrence. Increased exploitation, from pristine to fully exploited conditions, led to increased somatic growth (from 32 to 45mm/year) and adult life spans, and reduced age at maturity (from 11 to 8years). Variation in size at maturity was explained by climate and, less certainly, prey fish occurrence, while reproductive allocation was explained by evolutionary trade-offs with mortality and other traits, but not environment. Lake trout life-history variation within this range was as wide as that observed across dozens of other freshwater species. Lake trout life histories resulted from evolutionary trade-offs, growth plasticity and local adaptations along several environmental clines. Presuming a plastic response, we documented similar to 1.4-fold growth compensation to exploitationlower growth compensation than observed in many freshwater fishes. These results suggest that harvested species exposed to spatially structured and diverse environments may have substantial clinal variation on different traits, but due to different processes, and this has implications for their resilience and successful management.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000471342700006	30784045

No morphological criteria for determining larval competence in this slug are reliable; thus competence has been established by inducing metamorphosis with the hydroid Tubularia crocea. The competence period lasts approximately three weeks at 12-17 degrees C, the best time for inducing metamorphosis being from days 31-50 within a given egg mass, and more precisely from day 41 to 50, as concluded from several egg masses. Within-clutch and between-clutch variability exists in both Tubularia-induced and spontaneous metamorphosis. Variability within egg masses in Hermissenda is probably due to the gradual acquisition of metamorphic competence. Spontaneous metamorphosis increases significantly as larvae age within a given egg mass. Metamorphosis is non-specific, since the larvae are able to metamorphose with several natural inducers, such as other hydroids (Pennaria sp.) and anemones (Metridium senile and Haliplanella luciae). Combinations of Tubularia with glutamate at 10(-4) M or with Mg2+ at 20 mM significantly increased the metamorphic yields, while NH4+ was ineffective. K+ at 30 mM and Cs+ at 1 mM also increased the metamorphic yields, although Cs+ at 30 mM was toxic. Several combinations of the natural inducers and some cations also produced high metamorphic yields, up to 25%. The effect of epinephrine at 10(-5) M in increasing the metamorphic yields, when used in combination with Tubularia, was equal to that obtained when using aged epinephrine, indicating that the oxidized products of epinephrine are probably responsible for this activity. Increasing the temperature from 12 degrees C up to 17 degrees C also had a significant effect in increasing the metamorphic yields with several inducers. The extracts of Tubularia with several organic solvents did not have an inducing effect. The natural inducer from Tubularia seems to be a water-soluble compound. Aqueous extracts of Tubularia at high concentrations (about eight-times the normal amounts) produced yields up to 50+/-8.3% metamorphosis, i.e., five-times the maximum yields ever reported for Hermissenda.

Native warm-season grasses (NWSG) are promoted as sustainable forage alternatives. To examine nesting suitability for tall structure specialists such as Dickcissels (Spiza americana) we established an operational-scale study in northeastern Mississippi, USA, with 4 treatments along a gradient of beef production intensity. Treatments included grazed exotic forages, 2 grazed NWSG treatments including Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) monoculture and NWSG polyculture of Indiangrass, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), and an ungrazed NWSG polyculture treatment. We monitored 208 Dickcissel nests in 2011 and 2012 to evaluate effects of treatment, vegetation structure, fire ants (Solenopsis spp.), and arthropod prey biomass on nest-site selection and nest survival. Survival rates varied among treatments and increased with pasture-scale visual obstruction reading (VOR), being lowest among grazed exotic grass, intermediate in grazed NWSG, and highest in ungrazed NWSG. Although Dickcissels selected nest sites with greater VOR, we found little support for effects of nest-site vegetation on survival. However, nest survival was lower for nests in shrubs that also occurred in pastures with greater shrub cover, and selection for shrubs declined as pasture-scale VOR increased, suggesting a functional response in selection. We found little support for food availability influencing nest survival. These results suggest NWSG pastures increase Dickcissel nest success through greater pasture-scale VOR by reducing Dickcissel selection of shrubs for nest sites, and possibly by reducing predator efficiency. Incorporating NWSG into beef production systems while maintaining availability of tall vegetation could benefit Dickcissels and other tall structure specialists.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-5422	1938-5129		WOS:000488044400004

Four release sites, including one in the Central Valley and three along the Monterey Bay, were monitored from 1999 to 2015. Lygus spp. and P. relictus populations were monitored in alfalfa, weedy non-crop vegetation, and commercial strawberries. An experimental field cage study was also conducted to measure the contribution of both P. relictus and resident predators to Lygus spp. mortality. Results from both caging and longitudinal studies demonstrated that P. relictus had a negative impact on Lygus spp. nymphal densities.Annual percent parasitism peaks ranged from 45 to 71% in alfalfa or non-crop vegetation, which were either correlated with host densities or demonstrated a delayed density dependent response. Lygus spp. population reductions of over 90% were recorded at five of six sampling locations by 2011-2012. An increase in Lygus spp. densities was observed at two release sites during the last two years of monitoring in the Monterey Bay region and may be related to climate. In-season nymphal densities were correlated with winter temperatures, as warmer than average winters may have affected diapause and accelerated population growth rates. We consider this study, which corroborates the preference by P. relictus for congeneric North American host species, the biological control value of this parasitoid's establishment, and climate as a possible contributor to Lygus spp. population dynamics, to be a valuable contribution to understanding biological control of Lygus spp. by P. relictus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000411473000005

Since the mid-1990s, the species has spread along the entire Estonian Baltic coastline. Growth rate in the brackish water population does not differ much from freshwater populations, but the freshwater populations are gynogenetic (or show high dominance of females) in contrast to the Baltic Sea population, which presents a normal sex ratio. The recent explosion of this species in the Baltic Sea could be explained by unusually warm summers during the 1990s and by the low abundance of predatory fish.					11th European Congress of Ichthyology11th European Congress of Ichthyology	SEP 06-10, 2004SEP 06-10, 2004		Tallinn, ESTONIATallinn, ESTONIA	50	0	0	0	44	0	52			0175-8659			WOS:000231508000006		
J	Harms, Chelsea A.; Turingan, Ralph G.								Dietary flexibility despite behavioral stereotypy contributes to successful invasion of the pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, in Florida, USA								AQUATIC INVASIONS				7	4			547	553		10.3391/ai.2012.7.4.011				NOV 2012	2012	It is well known that the establishment of invasive-fish populations depends on the ability of introduced individuals to adapt to environmental conditions in the invaded ecosystem, including the ability to feed on diverse, locally available prey resources. Furthermore, the current invasive-biology paradigm postulates that having a generalist-food habit is key to the successful invasion of a novel community by exotic species. This study investigated how the invasive pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, has succeeded in establishing exotic populations in Florida, USA despite having a feeding apparatus that is characteristic of a specialized piscivore (i.e., fish-eating fish). Pike killifish collected from their point of introduction in south Florida were (1) filmed using high speed video while feeding on live fish-and shrimp-prey to determine whether prey type affects prey-capture kinematics and then (2) subjected to a prey-selectivity experiment to determine which prey type (live fish or shrimp) the invasive pike killifish eats when both prey are available in the environment. Results indicated that (1) prey-capture kinematics were not affected by prey type, indicating that consumption of fish and shrimp prey was accomplished using a stereotypical feeding repertoire, and (2) pike killifish consumed fish and shrimp when both prey were available in the feeding environment. It is concluded that the invasive pike killifish has the ability to feed on alternative, locally available prey using its piscivorous feeding functional morphology and prey-capture kinematics. This study contributes a new perspective to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie success of exotic fishes in invaded communities. That is, the ability of a functional-morphological specialist to utilize stereotypical prey-capture kinematics (= behavior) in consuming alternative, locally available prey types (= dietary flexibility) contributes to the establishment of invasive populations. It is evident that these functional specialists are not constrained in their diet, thus, enabling them dietary flexibility and enhancing their invasive potential.									3	0	0	0	3	0	4			1798-6540			WOS:000310725000011

Both species are prey for other fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals in Prince William Sound. We identified critical time-space linkages between the juvenile stages of pink salmon and herring rearing in shallow-water nursery areas and seasonally varying ocean state, the availability of appropriate zooplankton forage, and the kinds and numbers of predators. These relationships defined unique habitat dependencies for juveniles whose survivals were strongly linked to growth rates, energy reserves, and seasonal trophic sheltering from predators. We found that juvenile herring were subject to substantial starvation losses during a winter period of plankton diminishment, and that predation on juvenile pink salmon was closely linked to the availability of alternative prey for fish and bird predators. Our collaborative study further revealed that juvenile pink salmon and ages herring exploit very different portions of the annual production cycle. Juvenile pink salmon targeted the cool-water, early spring plankton bloom dominated by diatoms and large calanoid copepods, whereas young-of-the-year juvenile herring were dependent on warmer conditions occurring later in the postbloom summer and fall when zooplankton was composed of smaller calanoids and a diversity of other taxa. The synopsis of our studies presented in this volume speaks to contemporary issues facing investigators of fish ecosystems, including juvenile fishes, and offers new insight into problems of bottom-up and top-down control. In aggregate, our results point to the importance of seeking mechanistic rather than correlative understandings of complex natural systems.									71	0	0	0	51	0	74			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000173709000002

During the 1990s, estimates of relative year-class strength of capelin were similar to estimates in the 1980s, capelin spawned later and matured younger, mean fish size was smaller, and there were large-scale distributional shifts of capelin. Most of these changes were linked to below-normal sea temperatures during the early 1990s, but the changes have persisted even though temperatures have returned to normal. Seabirds bred later in the 1990s and changed diets and foraging strategies. Off eastern Newfoundland, the breeding success of black-legged kittiwakes declined during the early 1990s owing to a suite of factors, including their inability to dive to capture capelin, the late arrival of capelin inshore and predation by gulls. Common murres and puffins did not suffer breeding failures because they could dive and catch capelin at depth. Off Labrador, black-legged kittiwakes experienced breeding failures because of the lack of capelin while common murres were able to find alternate prey and bred successfully. The diets of gannets in the 1990s contained a higher proportion of cold-water prey than in earlier periods when warm-water prey predominated. The population sizes of all seabird species remained stable or increased, with the exception of gulls. Increasing populations of seabirds are related in part to their lessened mortality from gillnets since the closures of the eastern Canadian groundfishery in 1992, whereas declining populations of gulls can be related to reduced food availability from fishery discards and offal. This food limitation has led gulls to switch much of their foraging effort from scavenging to predation on seabird adults and chicks before capelin arrive inshore.Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

This theory predicts that individuals should gain the most energy for the lowest cost in terms of time and energy when foraging, in order to maximize their fitness. However, during a foraging trip, central-place foragers could face different trade-offs during the commuting and searching parts of the trip, influencing behavioral decisions. Using the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) as an example we study the time and energy costs of different behaviors during the commuting and searching parts of a foraging trip. Lesser kestrels are small insectivorous falcons that behave as central-place foragers during the breeding season. They can commute by adopting either time-saving flapping flights or energy-saving soaring-gliding flights, and capture prey by using either time-saving active hovering flights or energy-saving perch-hunting. We tracked 6 lesser kestrels using GPS and tri-axial accelerometers during the breeding season. Our results indicate that males devoted more time and energy to flight behaviors than females in agreement with being the sex responsible for food provisioning to the nest. During the commuting flights, kestrels replaced flapping with soaring-gliding flights as solar radiation increased and thermal updrafts got stronger. In the searching part, they replaced perch-hunting with hovering as wind speed increased and they experienced a stronger lift. But also, they increased the use of hovering as air temperature increased, which has a positive influence on the activity level of the preferred prey (large grasshoppers). Kestrels maintained a constant energy expenditure per foraging trip, although flight and hunting strategies changed dramatically with weather conditions, suggesting a fixed energy budget per trip to which they adjusted their commuting and searching strategies in response to weather conditions.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000402880700016	28591181

In old field systems, the common woodlouse may have an indirect effect on a nursery web spider. Woodlice and nursery web spiders feed in different food chains, yet previous work demonstrated that the presence of woodlice is correlated with higher predation success by nursery web spiders upon their grasshopper prey. This finding suggested a new hypothesis which links two seemingly disparate food chains: when woodlice are present, the spider predator or the grasshopper prey changes their location in the vegetative canopy in a way that increases their spatial overlap and therefore predation rate. However, warming temperatures may complicate this phenomenon. The spider cannot tolerate thermal stress, meaning warming temperatures may cause the spider to move downwards in the vegetative canopy or otherwise alter its response to woodlice. Therefore, we would expect warming and woodlice presence to have an interactive effect on predation rate.Methods. We conducted behavioral experiments in 2015, 2017, and 2018 to track habitat domains-the use of the vegetative canopy space by grasshoppers and spiders- in experimental cages. Then, we used three models of spider movement to try to explain the response of spiders to woodlice: expected net energy gain, signal detection theory, and individual-based modelling.Results. Habitat domain observations revealed that spiders shift upward in the canopy when woodlice are present, but the corresponding effect on grasshopper prey survival was variable over the different years of study. Under warming conditions, spiders remained lower in the canopy regardless of the presence of woodlice, suggesting that thermal stress is more important than the effect of woodlice. Our modelling results suggest that spiders do not need to move away from woodlice to maximize net energy gain (expected net energy gain and signal detection theory models). Instead spider behavior is consistent with the null hypothesis that they move away from unsuccessful encounters with woodlice (individual-based simulation). We conclude that mapping how predator behavior changes across biotic (e.g. woodlouse presence) and abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature) may be critical to anticipate changes in ecosystem dynamics.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2167-8359			WOS:000537133200004	32547862	
J	Allen, LG; Hovey, TE; Love, MS; Smith, JTW								The life history of the spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) within the Southern California Bight								CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS				36				193	203						OCT 1995	1995	Spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) are under increasing angling pressure in the shallow waters off southern California. In southern California, spotted sand bass are largely restricted to shallow, warm-water areas such as bays, estuaries, and harbors, which appear to serve as warm-water refuges for this basically subtropical species. Rod-and-reel sampling from June 1991 to August 1993 yielded 639 individuals from seven locations. Specimens ranged from 51 to 400 mm SL, with only 8 fish below 150 mm SL and 10 above 330 mm SL. Analysis of otolith sections revealed that a single opaque zone was laid down each summer. The oldest fish was 14 years old; the vast majority of the large specimens were 6 to 10 years old. Growth rate was sharply asymptotic, with some fish reaching 200 mm SL in their first year. Because growth rates varied significantly among the four locations tested, the overall growth model was highly variable (R(2) = 0.67). Half of the female spotted sand bass matured very early (age class 0) and at a small size (155 mm SL). Males matured later (50% maturity at 1.4 years) and at a somewhat larger size (50% at 180 mm SL). Gonosomatic indices indicated that spawning occurred from June through August in southern California. Spotted sand bass inhabiting the northern Gulf of California are believed to be protogynous hermaphrodites, and populations from San Diego Bay showed an age/sex composition pattern consistent with protogyny However, populations from the six other southern California locations had roughly equal representation of the sexes throughout the age structure, and many of the oldest individuals were females. This pattern is more consistent with gonochorism or ''partial'' protogyny. Southern California spotted sand bass seem to have a complex reproductive strategy which may include flexible rates of female sex change among populations and sneaking males that mimic females within spawning aggregations.Back-calculation of annual recruitment success from otolith data revealed that almost all of our fish came from two pulses during 1984-85 and 1989-90. These pulses occurred during post-El Nino years. Recruitment into southern California during El Nino years (1982-83, 1986-87, and 1992-93) appears to have been extremely low to nonexistent. However, summer sea-surface temperatures at the Scripps Pier peaked one to two years after these El Nino events, resulting in a highly significant correlation (r = 0.723, df = 13, P = 0.002) between recruitment (corrected for mortality) of spotted sand bass and mean summer sea-surface temperature off southern California over the past 15 years.									32	0	0	0	25	1	34			0575-3317			WOS:A1995TR42800020

Consumptive effects of fish reduce wetland crayfish recruitment and drive species turnover								OECOLOGIA				168	4			1111	1121		10.1007/s00442-011-2162-2				APR 2012	2012	Predators and dry-disturbances have pronounced effects on invertebrate communities and can deterministically affect compositional turnover between discrete aquatic habitats. We examined the effect of sunfish (Lepomis spp.) predators on two native crayfish, Procambarus alleni and P. fallax, that regionally coexist in an expansive connected wetland in order to test the hypotheses that sunfish predation limits crayfish recruitment (both species) and that it disproportionately affects P. alleni, the species inhabiting temporary wetlands. In replicate vegetated wetlands (18.6 m(2)), we quantified summertime crayfish recruitment and species composition across an experimental gradient of sunfish density. Separately, we quantified effects of sunfish on crayfish growth, conducted a complimentary predation assay in mesocosms, and compared behavior of the two crayfish. Sunfish reduced P. alleni summertime recruitment by > 99% over the full sunfish gradient, and most of the effect was caused by low densities of sunfish (0.22-0.43 m(-2)). P. alleni dominated wetlands with few or no sunfish, but the composition shifted towards P. fallax dominance in wetlands with abundant sunfish. P. fallax survived better than P. alleni over 40 h in smaller mesocosms stocked with warmouth. Sunfish reduced P. fallax recruitment 62% in a second wetland experiment, but growth rates of caged crayfish (both species) were unaffected by sunfish presence, suggesting predatory effects were primarily consumptive. Consistent with life histories of relatively fish-sensitive invertebrates, P. alleni engaged in more risky behaviors in the laboratory. Our results indicate that sunfish predators limit recruitment of both species, but disproportionately remove the more active and competitively dominant P. alleni. Spatially and temporally variable dry-disturbances negatively co-varying with sunfish populations allow for regional coexistence of these two crayfish and may release populations of either species from control by predatory fishes.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000301604200021	22011844

Handley, John/0000-0001-9790-7300			Anatomy of a cline: dissecting anti-predatory adaptations in a marine gastropod along the US Atlantic coast								ECOGRAPHY				40	11			1285	1299		10.1111/ecog.02444				NOV 2017	2017	The scope of anti-predatory adaptation is expected to be greater in warm than in cold environments. High temperatures lower the costs associated with the production and maintenance of energetically expensive traits and enable ecological interactions to intensify. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the expression of anti-predatory morphology within a marine gastropod species (the knobbed whelk Busycon carica) over a large (> 1400 km) geographic area that spans more than 10 degrees C annual temperature variation. We also conducted experimental predation studies with a powerful durophagous predator, the stone crab Menippe, to verify the anti-predatory advantages of a heavily ornamented shell morphology (e.g. increased thickness, pronounced spines), and we used repair scar data to assess clinal variation in selective pressure from predators. We predicted that repair scar rates would be greatest in warm southernmost latitudes, and that expression of energetically costly anti-predatory morphology would peak in concert with elevated predation pressures. Experiments confirmed that whelks with energetically costly, heavily ornamented shells had higher survivorship rates than those with weakly ornamented shells. As predicted, we also found that the expression of anti-predatory traits was greatest in the southern part of B. carica's range. After standardizing shells for size, shape, and exposure time to enemies, repair scar rates also peaked to the south. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of anti-predatory traits along the geographic cline is governed by the interaction of two selective factors: temperature and predation, with the former acting as the ultimate control on the scope of adaptation both by escalating predation pressure in the southern part of B. carica's range and by physically limiting (to the north) and facilitating (to the south) the production of anti-predatory traits. Feedbacks between temperature and predation thus causally interact to enable and drive, respectively, the observed geographic cline in energy-intensive anti-predatory shell traits.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:000413580700005

Emergence during the spring in cages placed over overwintered individuals occurred between 100 and 300 degree-days (DD) when temperature units were accumulated beginning 1 March. Fifty percent emergence occurred at 210 DD5degrees-C. Emergence was 2.3, 46.7, and 95.8% complete by the half inch green, pink, and the petal fall stages of 'Yorking' apple development, respectively. Most adults emerged on days of average, minimum, and maximum air temperatures of 15-20, 5-15, and 20-30-degrees-C, respectively. Temperatures in overwintering habitat were similar to ambient air temperature. Counts in the tree canopy were highly correlated with capture in the emergence cages in a warm year, but were too low to relate to capture in the other two cooler years. Capture of adults on yellow sticky boards was an efficient monitoring method; first capture occurred at 20-30% emergence. Yellow traps were more effective than white, and addition of ammonium carbonate did not significantly increase capture with yellow traps, but inhibited capture with white traps.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0046-225X			WOS:A1995QG51600018

Age data suggest it was released into Big Brook Dam (Warren River) in 1992 or 1993, where it has since played a role in eliminating the native teleosts. Its success here is attributed to a young age at maturity, rapid growth (compared with populations elsewhere), predatory nature, large size (compared with native fish), broad environmental and habitat tolerances, and absence of predators. Gonadal development initiates in late summer, with peak spawning between August and September. Males and females attained maturity in their first and second years, respectively, which is earlier than reported for most Northern Hemisphere populations and can be attributed to their rapid growth here because of the warmer climate. At ages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, males, on average, attained 102, 159, 206, 246 and 280 mm total length (TL) and females had attained 104, 166, 228, 290 and 351 mm TL at the respective ages. Diets of fish 50-200 mm TL comprised mainly small aquatic invertebrates, whereas larger fish preyed almost exclusively on decapods, mainly marron (Cherax tenuimanus), and teleosts.									36	0	0	0	38	0	40			1323-1650			WOS:000180748100008

However, in equatorial regions, where day length is nearly constant, other factors such as rainfall and temperature are thought to determine timing of reproduction. Rainfall can vary at small spatial and temporal scales, providing a highly fluctuating and unpredictable environmental cue. In this study we investigated the extent to which spatio-temporal variation in environmental conditions can explain the timing of breeding of Red-capped Lark, Calandrella cinerea, a species that is capable of reproducing during every month of the year in our equatorial east African study locations. For 39 months in three climatically-distinct locations, we monitored nesting activities, sampled ground and flying invertebrates, and quantified rainfall, maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperatures. Among locations we found that lower rainfall and higher temperatures did not coincide with lower invertebrate biomasses and decreased nesting activities, as predicted. Within locations, we found that rainfall, Tmax, and Tmin varied unpredictably among months and years. The only consistent annually recurring observations in all locations were that January and February had low rainfall, high Tmax, and low Tmin. Ground and flying invertebrate biomasses varied unpredictably among months and years, but invertebrates were captured in all months in all locations. Red-capped Larks bred in all calendar months overall but not in every month in every year in every location. Using model selection, we found no clear support for any relationship between the environmental variables and breeding in any of the three locations. Contrary to popular understanding, this study suggests that rainfall and invertebrate biomass as proxy for food do not influence breeding in equatorial Larks. Instead, we propose that factors such as nest predation, female protein reserves, and competition are more important in environments where weather and food meet minimum requirements for breeding during most of the year.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000399875200015	28419105

We tested three species of California hawks from autumn 2004 to spring 2006 for haemosporidian blood parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon spp.). We screened 323 Red-tailed Hawks (Boles jamaicensis), 100 Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii), and 21 Red-shouldered Hawks (B. lineatus) for blood parasites using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among these hawks, 221 (50%) were infected with Haemoproteus, 134 (30%) with Leucocytozoon, and none with Plasmodium species. We compared blood parasite prevalence results to identify infection patterns in two populations (birds captured during autumn at a migration watchsite in the Mann Headlands [Golden Gate Raptor Observatory] vs. birds captured during winter in the Central Valley) and between years, seasonal periods, and sex and age classes. In 2004, Mann Red-tailed Hawks were more likely to test positive for blood parasites if sampled late in the migration; however, we observed the opposite pattern in Cooper's Hawks. The prevalence of both Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon followed the same seasonal trends in each host species, which suggested a possible effect of infection status on raptor migration. We also observed different patterns of variation in parasite prevalence between years at the two sampling sites, but, no significant differences between juvenile and adult birds at either site. In addition, using a simple measure of body condition, we observed significant differences between males and females with regard to the effects of parasite infection and sampling location. These results provide a baseline for future studies monitoring long-term changes in parasite prevalence and effects on California's migrating hawks.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0892-1016			WOS:000281630500007

PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				76	2			676	684		10.1002/ps.5565		AUG 2019		FEB 2020	2020	BACKGROUND Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are a problematic pest in global sweet pepper cultivation. Control of aphids often relies on insecticides, leading to widespread resistance. Biological control of aphids is mainly based on releasing specialist natural enemies, but they often fail to control outbreaks. Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur (Hemiptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophagous generalist which attacks several sweet pepper pests, including aphids. Previous research showed that M. pygmaeus is capable of strongly reducing aphid populations in sweet pepper, but complete control was seldom achieved. Sweet pepper plants continue to grow during the season, reaching > 3 m high in Belgian and Dutch greenhouses. Dense foliage and large vertical distance from the flowers to the lower leaves impede the search efficiency of the predator. Leaf pruning may improve aphid predation by M. pygmaeus by increasing the probability of encountering prey. RESULTS Four and five treatments (foliage range: 100 cm to full length) respectively were tested in a semi-commercial sweet pepper greenhouse in 2017 and 2018. Aphid populations in pruned treatments grew more slowly than in the control and M. pygmaeus was eventually able to control aphids in all pruned treatments in 2018. There was no difference in aphid control between the pruned treatments. Sweet pepper production was lower in the treatments with the shortest foliage lengths. CONCLUSION Leaf pruning up to 160 or 190 cm foliage length improves aphid control by M. pygmaeus in sweet pepper without affecting production.

J	Jochmann, Ralf; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.								Non-target effects of ivermectin on trophic groups of the cow dung insect community replicated across an agricultural landscape								BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY				17	4			291	299		10.1016/j.baae.2016.01.001				JUN 2016	2016	Environmental stressors can have unintended negative effects on beneficial organisms. Testing environmental effects of pharmaceutical residues is therefore often mandated in form of single-species ecotoxicological laboratory tests, yet differential sensitivity of species can ultimately disturb the entire community. A more realistic approach is to directly assess toxicity in the field to account for spatio-temporal variation in climate and habitat. We conducted the first field study at the landscape scale, replicated al 24 Swiss farms north of the Alps, to test the impact of a realistically low concentration (6,6 mu g/kg fresh dung) of the popular parasiticide ivermeain on the beneficial cow dung insect community over the season, We found a graded negative impact of ivermectin on many but not all species, with significant reductions in ca. one third of 32 evaluated fly (Diptera) and wasp (Hymenoptera) taxa, No taxon benefited from ivermectin presence. Small hymenopteran parasitoids particularly decreased in numbers (62%), with large dipteran predators (38%) being reduced more than primary coprophagous dung consumers (234), This supports theoretical expectations that the [op trophic levels of a community are particularly vulnerable to environmental disturbance because their numbers tend to be low and their body size large, hut also because pollutants can biomagnify in the food chain. Sensitivity to pollutants may further exhibit a phylogenetic signal. Ivermectin residues thus generally reduced the biodiversity of the dung insect community, but impact varied among farms, years and over the season, being lowest in autumn. We conclude that spatio-temporal replication of such higher-tier field studies is advised to capture the full extent of effects in realistic natural settings, as even low concentrations of a pharmaceutical can have varying impact on the different organisms comprising an ecosystem.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1439-1791	1618-0089		WOS:000375569900002

In total, 1400 stomachs of 7 batoids species were analyzed and 29 prey items were identified (grouped in food category: shrimp, crabs, peracarids, stomatopods, cephalopods, fish and polychaetes). The main prey items were the shrimps (Ogyrididae, Penaeidae and Processidae), serpulid polychaete (Serpullidae) and portunid crabs (Portunidae). According to Smith's index values, the 7 batolds species were generalist with a broad trophic spectrum. During the warm season the highest values of the diet overlap were recorded, mainly between species of the same family (Narcinidae, Rhinobatidae and Urotrygonidae). This pattern might be associated with the opportunism and preference to consume the most abundant prey, which reduces competence for food when resource is scarce.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0717-3326	0718-1957		WOS:000366288000010		
J	Stamp, NE; Yang, YL; Osier, TL				Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011				Response of an insect predator to prey fed multiple allelochemicals under representative thermal regimes								ECOLOGY				78	1			203	214						JAN 1997	1997	We examined the effects of three allelochemicals found in tomato (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21 degrees:10 degrees C and 26 degrees:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer, respectively) on the performance of a generalist insect predator (Podisus maculiventris: Pentatomidae) fed prey containing those allelochemicals. The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that the effects of these thermal and dietary conditions were distinctly different for prey and predators, which suggests that such conditions would promote developmental asynchrony between prey and predator populations.									28	0	0	0	26	2	29			0012-9658			WOS:A1997WD34500016

Acute changes in environmental temperature are known to impact the rate at which animals change colour, and therefore may affect their survival.Many ectotherms have the ability to acclimate performance traits such as locomotion, metabolic rate and growth rate with changes in seasonal temperature. However, it remains unclear how other functional traits that are directly linked to behaviour and survival respond to long-term changes in temperature (within an individual's lifetime).We assessed whether the rate of colour change is altered by long-term changes in temperature (seasonal variation) and if rate of colour change can acclimate to seasonal thermal conditions. We used an intertidal rock-pool goby Bathygobius cocosensis, to test this and exposed individuals to representative seasonal mean temperatures (16 or 31 degrees C, herein referred to cold- and warm-exposed fish respectively) for 9 weeks and then tested their rate of luminance change when placed on white and black backgrounds at acute test temperatures 16 and 31 degrees C. We modelled rate of luminance change using the visual sensitives of a coral trout Plectropmus leopardus to determine how well gobies matched their backgrounds in terms of luminance contrast to a potential predator.After exposure to long-term seasonal conditions, the warm-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their background more closely when tested at 31 than at 16 degrees C. Similarly, the cold-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their backgrounds more closely at 16 degrees C than at 31 degrees C. This demonstrates that rate of luminance change can be adjusted to compensate for long-term changes in seasonal temperature.This is the first study to show that animals can acclimate rate of colour change for background matching to seasonal thermal conditions. We also show that rapid changes in acute temperature reduce background matching capabilities. Stochastic changes in climate are likely to affect the frequency of predator-prey interactions which may have substantial knock-on effects throughout ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000525986000001	32227334

Therefore, we have little idea about their generality, scales of variability, or reliance on local conditions. Transplant experiments and surveys conducted at 14 sites spanning across similar to 900 km of the central Chilean coast demonstrate that alongshore variation in upwelling, occurring over 10s to 100s of kilometers, explains among-site differences in growth rates of the turf-forming alga Gelidium chilense, which drives predictable landscape patterns in turf height. At upwelling centers, turf algae grew faster and attained taller heights than at warmer downstream locations, where the algal turf remained short because it grew slower and was pruned-back in winter. Replicated, reciprocal transplants of tall and short algal turf, combined with manipulations that controlled predator access to turf, revealed that recruitment of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus was differentially enhanced by the turf; benefits were strong when the turf was short, but disappeared when the turf was tall. By determining mussel prey supply to higher trophic levels, upwelling-controlled facilitation has important consequences for community regulation. This is the first study to identify upwelling as a physical mechanism generating environmental conditions that (1) control trait-dependent habitat modification and (2) regulate the relative importance of facilitation in marine rocky intertidal communities.									67	0	0	0	60	8	68			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000233569700004		
J	MURRAY, AM; GILLER, PS								LIFE-HISTORY AND OVERWINTERING TACTICS OF VELIA-CAPRAI TAM (HEMIPTERA, VELIIDAE) IN SOUTHERN IRELAND								AQUATIC INSECTS				13	4			229	243		10.1080/01650429109361450				1991	1991	Velia caprai Tamanini (Hemiptera: Veliidae) is predominantly a stream dweller, and has been considered univoltine in the British Isles, with adults overwintering in a reproductively immature state. This study reveals a far more complex life-cycle. Dissections of females captured between October 1986 and March 1987 revealed that while 17% of individuals had deposits of adipose tissue and showed no reproductive development (diapause individuals), the majority of females examined (83%) revealed mature ovaries. This presence of a non-diapause overwintering subpopulation of reproductively mature females has not been previously recorded for this species. The absence of adipose tissue in these latter females, plus the presence of obviously full guts in 24% of cases - indicating very recent feeding - supports this non-diapause overwintering. Sampling also revealed that fifth instar larvae overwintered and these comprised 2.3% of all individuals (excluding first instar larvae) captured between November 1986 and March 1987.Three different overwintering tactics were therefore identified with early spring populations therefore consisting of mature egg-bearing females, immature females and some fifth instar larvae. Information from less complete data of spring 1986 confirmed that the variation in the overwintering status of females in 1987 was not a once-off response to unusual climatic conditions. This distinct within-population temporal variability in the attainment of reproductive maturity by the females of Velia caprai extended the reproductive season of the species, and may help buffer populations from being overly affected by adverse weather conditions during the late autumn and early spring months.First instar larvae were encountered in the field by mid-March - two months earlier than previous records. New-generation adults were subsequently captured in mid-June, and there is indirect evidence to suggest a partial second generation may sometimes occur under suitable circumstances. Growth experiments over a range of temperatures indicated faster development at the higher temperatures, although a reduced survival rate at temperatures above 20-degrees-C was noted.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0165-0424			WOS:A1991HD28900006

Investigations of parental breeding strategies under variable environmental conditions can illustrate how parents trade-off the benefits and costs of these two extreme strategies. White-collared Blackbirds Turdus albocinctus can breed twice a year on the Tibetan Plateau. We show that both life-history traits and parental feeding behaviour differ between these two breeding attempts. In the first attempt, the birds produced small clutches and fledged a small number of nestlings of high body condition. In the second attempt, they produced larger clutches and fledged more nestlings of lower body condition. Males made greater contributions to brood provisioning compared with females in the first attempt but there was no sex difference in brood provisioning in the second attempt. In the first attempt, producing smaller clutches can shorten the nestling period, and the increased male contribution to brood provisioning can protect the energy reserves of females. Thus, females can begin a second attempt sooner and produce larger clutches. During the second nesting attempt, when conditions are warmer and wetter, parents rely on a broader array of food types (both invertebrates and plant material, primarily berries) than during the first attempt, which includes only animal food such as arthropods and annelids. We suggest that this difference in breeding strategies between nesting attempts and sexes is in part influenced by marked seasonal variation in food availability.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0019-1019	1474-919X		WOS:000410649500014

The central and western shelf are warmer, experienced a cold period during the 1960s, and then warmed to. above average until 1998 when an intrusion of cold Labrador Shelf water caused significant cooling. The eastern shelf cooled from about 1983 to the early 1990s and bottom temperature has remained below average since then. This cold period is associated with increased abundance of cold water fish (capelin, turbot) and invertebrates (snow crab, shrimp) usually more prevalent in colder Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland waters. Colder temperatures are also implicated in reductions in growth rates of demersal fishes. Phytoplankton greenness and total copepod indices are higher and show peaks earlier in the year during the early 1990s than during the 1960s. An increase in the abundance of arctic copepod species also accompanied the cooling of the eastern shelf.Trawlable demersal biomass has declined on both portions of the shelf but most rapidly on the eastern shelf since the early 1980s. However, total finfish biomass (corrected for relative catchabilities) shows a variable increase since the mid-1980s. Pelagic fish biomass has increased, and the ratio of demersal to pelagic biomass has decreased, especially in the east. Average size of demersal fishes decreased by 60 to 70% since 1970 in both systems, and both have shown significant changes in the integrated community size frequency (ICSF) with a reduction in numbers of large fish. Fishing effort, which increased rapidly following the 1977 establishment of Canada's 200-mile exclusive economic zone, was negatively correlated with community size structure. A reduction in effort in the early 1990s is associated with an apparent reversal in the trend of decreasing ICSF The decrease in ICSF was more rapid in the colder eastern shelf and was considered to be related to differences in growth rates between the two systems. Grey seal abundance has increased exponentially since the 1960s, especially on the eastern shelf, however, the impact of this increase on levels of predation remains uncertain due to the paucity of comparative diet information prior to the mid-1980s.

J	Aukema, BH; Clayton, MK; Raffa, KF								Modeling flight activity and population dynamics of the pine engraver, Ips pini, in the Great Lakes region: effects of weather and predators over short time scales								POPULATION ECOLOGY				47	1			61	69		10.1007/s10144-004-0202-z				APR 2005	2005	Ascertaining the relative effects of factors such as weather and predation on population dynamics, and determining the time scales on which they operate, is important to our understanding of basic ecology and pest management. In this study, we sampled the pine engraver Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and its predominant predators Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Paykull) (Coleoptera: Histeridae) in red pine plantations in Wisconsin, USA, over 2 years. We sampled both the prey and predators using flight traps baited with the synthetic aggregation pheromone of I. pini. Flight models were constructed using weather variables (temperature and precipitation), counts of bark beetles and their predators, and temporal variables to incorporate possible effects of seasonality. The number of I. pini per weekly collection period was temperature dependent and decreased with the number of predators, specifically T. dubius in 2001 and P. cylindrica in 2002. The number of predators captured each week was also weather dependent. The predators had similar seasonal phenologies, and the number of each predator species was positively correlated with the other. Including a term for the number of prey did not improve the model fits for either predator for either year. Our results suggest that exogenous weather factors strongly affect the flight activity of I. pini, but that its abundance is also affected by direct density-dependent processes acting over weekly time scales. Adult predation during both colonization and dispersal are likely processes yielding these dynamics.									25	0	0	0	21	0	25			1438-3896			WOS:000229109900008

JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY				74				181	186		10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.024				MAY 2018	2018	Wormlions are sit-and-wait insect predators that construct pit-traps to capture arthropod prey. They require loose soil and shelter from direct sun, both common in Mediterranean cities, and explaining their high abundance in urban habitats. We studied different aspects of thermal acclimation in wormlions. We compared chill-coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat-shock recovery time (HSRT) of wormlions from urban, semi-urban and natural habitats, expecting those originating from the urban habitat to be more heat tolerant and less cold tolerant. However, no differences were detected among the three habitats. We then examined whether maintenance temperature affects CCRT and HSRT, and expected beneficial acclimation. However, CCRT was unaffected by maintenance temperature, while temperature affected HSRT in an opposite direction to our prediction: wormlions maintained under the higher temperatures took longer to recover. When testing with two successive thermal shocks, wormlions took longer to recover from both cold and heat shock after applying an initial cold shock. We therefore conclude that cold shock inflicts some damage rather than induces acclimation. Finally, both cold- and heat-shocked wormlions constructed smaller pits than wormlions of a control group. Smaller pits probably translate to a lower likelihood of capturing prey and also limit the size of the prey, indicating a concrete cost of thermal shock. In summary, we found no evidence for thermal acclimation related either to the habitat-of-origin or to maintenance temperatures, but, rather, negative effects of unfavorable temperatures.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0306-4565			WOS:000436526200024	29801625

Process-based modeling can help to explore these interactions and identify under which conditions biological control is likely, and when not. Here, we present a process-based model for population interactions between the phytophagous mite, Tetranychus urticae, and its predator, Typhlodromus pyri, on apple trees. Temperature and leaf nitrogen concentration influence T. urticae rates of development and reproduction, while temperature and rate of ingestion of prey and pollen influence T. pyri rates of survival and reproduction. Predator and prey population dynamics are linked through a stage structured functional response model that accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density throughout the trees. T. urticae biomass-days (BMD's), which account for sizes of larvae, nymphs and adults, indicate level of mite-induced leaf damage. When BMD's exceed 290 per leaf, there are economic losses. When BMD's exceed 350 per leaf, T. urticae population growth is curbed and eventually the population decreases. Simulations were run to determine which conditions would lead to current year economic loss and increased risk of loss in the following year, i.e. where more T. urticae than T. pyri are present at the end of September. Risk was high with one or more of the following initial conditions: a high prey: predator ratio (10:1 or more); a low to intermediate (0.04-0.2 T. urticae per leaf) initial density; T. urticae with a higher initial proportion of adult females than T. pyri; and a delayed first detection of mites, whether in late July, or sometimes in late June, but not in early June. Warm summer weather, higher leaf nitrogen and T. urticae immigration into trees were also risk factors. Causes for these patterns based on biological characteristics of T. urticae and T. pyri are discussed, as are counter measures which can be taken to reduce risk.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0168-8162			WOS:000318497000005	23299914	
J	Samocha, Yehonatan; Scharf, Inon								Comparison of wormlion behavior under man-made and natural shelters: urban wormlions more strongly prefer shaded, fine-sand microhabitats, construct larger pits and respond faster to prey								CURRENT ZOOLOGY				66	1			91	98		10.1093/cz/zoz006				FEB 2020	2020	Urban habitats differ from their natural surroundings in various aspects, such as a higher temperature and a distinct species composition. It is therefore not surprising that animal behavior too differs between these habitat types. We studied the foraging and habitat selection behavior of a pit-building predator, a wormlion, originating from either an urban or a more natural site. Wormlions occur in nature under structures that provide shelter from sunlight and rain, such as caves, and are also common in cities, occurring under artificial shelters. Wormlions construct pit-traps to hunt arthropods, and the pits constructed by urban wormlions were larger than those constructed by wormlions from caves. Urban wormlions responded faster to prey falling into their pit, probably leading to a higher capture success. We suggest that these 2 findings indicate the higher investment of urban wormlions in foraging, resulting from the higher abundance of potential prey in the city. Urban wormlions were choosier regarding their preferred microhabitat. While both fine sand and shaded microhabitats were preferred by wormlions, urban wormlions demonstrated a greater preference for such conditions. We suggest that relocation is more likely to lead wormlions in cities to find microhabitats of a higher quality compared with wormlions inhabiting caves. This is probably due to the larger areas in the city available for wormlions. Wormlions from the caves possessed more lipids, suggesting that they employ a conservative growth strategy, intended to contend with the uncertainty of prey arrival, in contrast to the city, where potential prey are more abundant.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1674-5507	2396-9814		WOS:000515146700011	32467709

Before ice cover, algal concentration was low and uniformly distributed with depth, as it is in open Lake Michigan. During ice cover (February and March), a bloom of a typical winter-spring phytoplankton community developed in the upper 40 m, resulting in a 4 to 7-fold increase in feeding rate of adult Diaptomus spp. High algal concentration and zooplankton feeding persisted after ice melt (April). During and after ice cover, lipid concentrations of Diaptomus dropped rapidly from 34% of dry weight to 17% because of egg production. High incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), high (45-50%) PAR transmittance of the ice due to little snow on the ice, and water column stability were probably responsible for the bloom. High ice transparency may be a common feature of large lakes and bays, where strong winds blow snow cover off the ice, or at low latitudes where snowmelt due to occasional rains and warm temperature is common. Winter reproducing calanoid copepods use these blooms to increase their reproductive output.

Spiders were captured with pit-fall traps in 3 representative environments of the park, for 2 seasons (2011-2012): native forest (BN), exotic forest (BE) and grasslands (P), characterized by graminiform plants. 1,398 spiders were collected (26 families and 120 species/morphospecies). The highest spider abundance was registered in P (678 individuals), followed by BE (501) and BN (219), while species richness was higher in BN. Diversity indexes showed statistically significant differences among the environments sampled. Heterogeneity variables used in this study showed a higher heterogeneity in BN, followed by P and BE as the most homogenous. Eight guilds were registered. All of the guilds were present in BN, while the sensing web weavers were not recorded in the BE, as well as the ambush hunters in P. This work constitutes the first approach about the importance and changes undergone by the diversity of ground spiders in environments with different degrees of heterogeneity, as a result of the advance of exotic species in a park from Entre Rios.

The investigation considered feeding activity, dietary composition and foraging strategy. Feeding activity,measured by stomach fullness, was unrelated to age, sex or reproductive status and showed little variation during the warmer months; in winter feeding was greatly reduced. N. ocellatus exhibits flexible foraging behaviour; a wide variety of terrestrial arthropods is taken opportunistically in accordance with a wide ranging foraging strategy. However, the consistent occurrence of cryptic and hidden prey indicates that active search foraging is also utilised. No evidence for ambush predation was found and, unlike many other small skinks, few arboreal or aerial prey are included in the diet, even though the habitat is rock scree and woodland where such prey abound. No evidence for any in a specific partitioning of diet based on kind or size of prey was obtained although a slight, but significant, correlation exists between maximum prey size and lizard size.									24	1	0	0	26	0	27			0004-959X			WOS:A1996UM91100009		
J	Ryer, Clifford H.								A review of flatfish behavior relative to trawls								FISHERIES RESEARCH				90	1-3			138	146		10.1016/j.fishres.2007.10.005				APR 2008	2008	Trawls harness the innate avoidance behavior of fish to affect their capture. As such, effective bycatch reduction relies, in part, upon knowledge of behavioral differences between target and non-target species. The behavior of flatfish during herding, net entry and passage through trawls differs substantially from that of many roundfish. These differences result from the unique body morphology of flatfish and the constraints this morphology places upon their natural predator avoidance and evasion tactics. Paramount, in this regard, is the intimate association between flatfish and the seafloor. Flatfish utilize a detection minimization strategy that combines burial, highly evolved cryptic capabilities and low activity. Additionally, the maximum sustained swimming speeds and endurance of flatfishes are low compared to most roundfish. As a result, flatfish typically respond to trawl ground-gear at shorter distances, remain closer to the seafloor during herding and herd in the net mouth for a shorter time, prior to net entry, than roundfish. As is the case for roundfish species, light and temperature influence flatfish reactivity and herding behavior. At low ambient light levels herding behavior in flatfish breaks down, as fish initially respond to ground-gear by rising off the bottom, which removes them from the ground-gear's zone of influence. Similarly, at low temperatures some flatfish display reduced herding. Differences in behavior between flatfish and roundfish have spurred development of selective flatfish trawls, with low rise head ropes and/or open or large mesh intermediates that allow rising roundfish to exit the net opening, while flatfish remain close to the net floor, passing into the net and back to the codend. Lastly, a conceptual design for a counter-herding device is presented, which takes advantage of the longer reactive distances of roundfish, and their tendency to herd farther of the seafloor, thereby allowing them to be herded out of the path of the net, while not influencing the normal inward herding of flatfish.

J	BEA, A; BRANA, F; BARON, JP; SAINTGIRONS, H				Brana, Florentino/A-4368-2008				DIET AND ALIMENTARY CYCLES OF EUROPEAN VIPUS (REPTILIA, VIPERIDAE) - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY								ANNEE BIOLOGIQUE				31	1			25	44						MAR 1992	1992	The dietary of european vipers belonging to the genus Vipera differs according to the species, the life-stage and the environment attended. Most of the species feed exclusively or essentially on tetrapod vertebrates among which the small mammals and chiefly the Microtinae represent the majority of the preys of the adults. However, V. monticola feeds exclusively on Lizards and V. ursinii is the only species of the genus which swallows regularly and sometimes uniquely invertebrates, essentially Orthoptera. Except in the case of V. monticola, the dietary of the adults is liable to variation according to the environment and the availability of the preys. In case of necessity kinds of preys which are not habitually eaten such as Amphibians may occupy a dominant share in the dietary.The important ontogenic variations of the dietary are most frequently linked with the capacities of ingestion, therefore with the size of the vipers and not with modifications of the alimentary habits. However, except with V. ursinii and V. monticola, the lizards become more and more rare in the dietary during the growth and as a general rule finish but not being any more eaten by the adults.The digestion is only possible during the sufficiently warm seasons. In this frame the length of the period or periods of alimentation is dependent on the sexual condition and the males do not feed during the mating period. In most of the species it is the same with the pregnant females, whereas the non reproductive females and the immatures feed during all the potential feeding season. There are however short alimentary cycles of which the rhythm depends only partially of the molts. V. ursinii represents a particular case according to the place occupied by Orthoptera in its dietary and the females carry on their feeding during the gestation. Besides, in the populations feeding exclusively on Orthoptera, the feeding season starts only with the apparition of larvae over 16 mm, at the end of June, but there are apparently no short term feeding cycles.									30	0	0	0	33	0	35			0003-5017			WOS:A1992HV48800003

There was clear geographic differentiation in mercury concentrations, with specimens from the South Orkney Islands having total mercury concentrations 5 to 7 times higher than Antarctic krill from South Georgia and the Antarctic Polar Front. Mercury did not appear to accumulate with life-stage since juveniles had higher concentrations of total mercury (0.071 mu g g(-1) from South Orkney Islands; 0.014 mu g g(-1) from South Georgia) than adults (0.054 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.048 mu g g(-1) in males from South Orkney Islands; 0.006 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.007 mu g g(-1) in males from South Georgia). Results suggest that females may use egg laying as a mechanism to excrete mercury, with eggs having higher concentrations than the corresponding somatic tissue. Organic mercury makes up a minor percentage of total mercury (15-37%) with the percentage being greater in adults than in juveniles. When compared to euphausiids from other parts of the world, the concentration of mercury in Antarctic krill is within the same range, or higher, highlighting the global distribution of this contaminant. Given the high potential for biomagnification of mercury through food webs, concentrations in Antarctic krill may have deleterious effects on long-lived Antarctic krill predators.

For this pest, defoliation thresholds were established based on large forest tracts, although these may yield inaccurate predictions in urban and suburban landscapes.3 Analyses of defoliation and fall cankerworm sticky band traps in Fairfax County, Virginia, U.S.A., indicate that trees with >200 female moths have >50% probability of being defoliated at moderate or greater intensity. This threshold is much larger than the threshold of 45 females previously established for large forest tracts, and a statistical model based on this established threshold proved an extremely poor fit to the data. In addition, we found little spatial correlation in fall cankerworm abundance among trap locations, in contrast to an established rule of thumb proposing that one trap per 40 ha can estimate fall cankerworm abundance for areas over 400 ha.4 These findings highlight the importance of the ecological context in which management recommendations are made.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000373777800006

Food diets and trophic interactions between of the flatfish species are described as well. Flatfishes are distributed between 20 and 60 m depth. Bothus leopardinus showed the greatest abundance during the cold season (January-May), the other species did not show significant differences between seasons (cold and warm). The diet of the flatfish species consist of crustaceans, fishes and cephalopods. B. leopardinus and Syacium ovale are consumers of crustaceans, such as crabs, shrimps and stomatopods. Cyclopsetta panamensis, C. querna and Monolene assaedae based their diet in fishes and cephalopods. The feeding strategy of the five species analyzed is considered to be generalist, consuming a high number of preys in both seasons. Between the flatfish species, low values of overlapping in the diets were observed in size class and periods of the year. The flatfish species consume the available food resources and could change the preys consumed, according to prey availability, to avoid intra and interspecific competition.									4	0	0	0	4	3	4			0718-560X	0717-7178		WOS:000322262000006

These bivalves are common prey items for benthivorous predators such as Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), and diving seaducks, such as Spectacled Eiders (Somateria fischeri. We investigated the effects of decreased pH and food availability on growth (% change in length and wet weight and allometric growth characterizations) and oxygen consumption (mg/L/hour) of three common Arctic bivalves, Macoma calcarea, Astarte montagui, and Astarte borealis. Two sets of experiments were run for seven and eleven weeks, exposing the bivalves to control (8.05 +/- 0.02 and 8.19 +/- 0.003, respectively) and acidified (7.76 +/- 0.01 and 7.86 +/- 0.01, respectively) pH treatments. Length, weight, and oxygen consumption were not significantly different among the varying treatments after the seven-week exposure and only one significant effect of decreased pH and one significant effect of decreased food availability were observed after the end of the eleven-week exposure. Specifically, shells of A. borealis displayed a decrease in length in response to decreased pH and M. calcarea showed a decrease in length in response to limited food. The negative effects of pH observed in the experiments on growth and oxygen consumption were small, suggesting that at least two of these species are generally resilient to decreasing pH.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0967-0645	1879-0100		WOS:000413800300010		
J	FISCHER, GW; GRANT, WE								USE OF A NATIVE PREDATOR TO CONTROL OVERCROWDING IN WARM-WATER POLYCULTURE PONDS - SIMULATION OF A TUCUNARE (CICHLA-MONOCULUS) TILAPIA (OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS) SYSTEM								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				72	3-4			205	227		10.1016/0304-3800(94)90084-1				APR 1994	1994	In this paper we describe an ecologically mechanistic simulation model representing the use of native predators (tucunare, Cichla monoculus) to control overcrowding of the primary culture species (tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus). The model consists of a prey submodel representing population dynamics and growth of tilapia, a predator submodel representing the predation process and subsequent population dynamics and growth of tucunare, and an economic submodel that calculates total net revenue.Simulated harvest weights of tilapia and tucunare were not distinguishably different from field observations, although tilapia weights were overestimated slightly. Results of sensitivity analysis suggest that the model could benefit most from refined estimates of tilapia growth rate and a better understanding of the dynamic size relationships between predator and prey that determine prey availability. Simulation of 21 different management scenarios suggests that stocking 10 tucunare weighing either 2 g or 10 g yields the highest total net revenue at the earliest harvest date. Stocking 20 tucunare weighing either 2 g or 10 g yields only slightly less total net revenue, but postpones harvest time by 3 weeks.Given the complexity of predator-prey relationships within polyculture systems, the interpretation of field observations on fish survival and growth can be enhanced greatly when viewed within the framework of an ecological model. From a management perspective, ecological models provide a means of explicitly relating pond production, and hence net revenue, to the underlying ecological processes that ultimately drive system dynamics.									13	0	0	0	15	1	15			0304-3800			WOS:A1994NH37700004

Whilst differences in weight at age across the North Sea have been investigated previously, the scale and cause of this variation as well as the potential link to spatial differences in predator performance remains unknown. This study presents an analysis of spatial patterns in length and condition of the lesser sandeel in the North Sea and the relationship of these with physical and biological factors. Both mean length at age and condition was higher on warmer, deeper and central/north eastern fishing grounds. Sandeel in the water column exhibited large changes in condition over the season, having an initially low condition following spring emergence rising to a pronounced peak by June. Weight at age varied considerably both spatially and temporally, resulting in 4 fold and 1.9 fold variations in the number of sandeels required to obtain a specific weight, respectively. Hence, the value of sandeel as prey to single load predators varies considerably with values in central and northeastern North Sea being substantially higher than in northwestern and southern areas.

J	Han, Bo-Ping; Lin, Xian; Lei, Lamei; Gu, Jiguang								Survivals of D. galeata in sub-tropical reservoirs: harmful effects of toxic cyanobacteria in food source								ECOTOXICOLOGY				21	6	SI		1692	1705		10.1007/s10646-012-0940-1				AUG 2012	2012	In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that massive occurrence of cyanobacteria as food source is one of the factors limiting the distribution of the zooplankton Daphnia galeata in the warm water reservoirs of South China. D. galeata was fed with Chlorella pyrenoidosa, 4 strains of cyanobacteria (three strains of Microcystis aeruginosa: MC1, MC2 and MC3, and one strain of Pseudoanabaena sp. :PA), a mixture of C. pyrenoidosa and cyanobacterial strains, and natural particles from the reservoir where the animal was initially collected. On medium and high food levels (1 and 1.5 mg C L-1) of C. pyrenoidosa, D. galeata showed a typical Type III of survivorship, and had a high intrinsic rate of population increase (0.37-0.41). On low food levels, the intrinsic rate of population increase declined but lifespan largely increased (84 days). When feeding with natural particles, the intrinsic rate of increase was evidently reduced (0.19), but the maximal body length (2 mm) was much longer than that of individuals observed in the fields implying that D. galeata was strongly preyed upon by size-selective predators. Applying a mixture of Chlorella and cyanobacteria, the strain and proportion of cyanobacteria significantly affected life history variables of the animal and its somatic growth. On the sole diet of each stain of cyanobacteria, D. galeata failed to reproduce. Microcystin and colonial morphology of Microcystis strains reduced clutch size and somatic growth rate. In comparison, the less negative effect of the strain MC3 indicates that the morphology was critical for actual ingestion of toxic cyanobacteria by the zooplanktons. Pseudoanabaena sp. had a short filament (15 mu m), can be easily used as a food by D. galeata. Composition of phytoplankton community plays a significant role in survival and population sizes of D. galeata and massive occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms limits the distribution of D. galeata in the reservoirs of South China.									10	1	0	0	12	0	12			0963-9292	1573-3017		WOS:000306592100014	22678553

Although winter has been recognized as an important period for many warmwater fishes and for stream-dwelling salmonids, winter limitations have only recently been studied for coolwater and coldwater species. Ice and snow cover in winter limited light penetration. As a result, chlorophyll-a and zooplankton density were lower in ice-covered periods than during ice-free periods. The weight of stomach contents was often below a maintenance ration, yet the incidence of empty stomachs was extremely low (I of 63) and the weight of stomach contents increased as energy reserves declined, indicating that kokanee were actively foraging during winter. Kokanee length and weight remained constant during the winter of 1993-1994 but increased from November through May in 1994-1995. Condition factors, however, declined significantly over the winter in both years, and lipid content approached levels associated with mortality. Differences in growth patterns may have been caused by a combination of changes in zooplankton density and kokanee abundance and in kokanee behavior to defend energy reserves or avoid predation. Results demonstrated the ambiguity of some growth measurements and the importance of choosing the correct metric for measuring growth in fishes. Because juvenile kokanee and sockeye salmon are ecologically similar, management efforts to restore the endangered Snake River sockeye salmon to the Sawtooth Valley lakes should recognize that winter conditions might be a bottleneck for this species.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			0002-8487			WOS:000186618100004

Noctiluca and copepods grazing on the phytoplankton community in a nutrient-enriched coastal environment along the southwest coast of India								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				189	7					351	10.1007/s10661-017-6061-9				JUL 2017	2017	The relative grazing impact of Noctiluca scintillans (hereafter referred only Noctiluca) and copepods (Acrocalanus gracilis, Paracalanus parvus, Acartia danae and Oithona similis) on the phytoplankton community in an upwelling-mudbank environment along the southwest coast India is presented here. This study was carried out during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (April-May) to the Late Southwest Monsoon (August) period in 2014. During the sampling period, large hydrographical transformation was evident in the study area (off Alappuzha, Southwest coast of India); warmer Pre-Southwest Monsoon water column condition got transformed into cooler and nitrate-rich hypoxic waters during the Southwest Monsoon (June-August) due to intense coastal upwelling. Copepods were present in the study area throughout the sampling period with a noticeable increase in their abundance during the Southwest Monsoon. On the other hand, the first appearance of Noctiluca in the sampling location was during the Early Southwest Monsoon (mid-June) and thereafter their abundance increased towards the Peak Southwest Monsoon. The grazing experiments carried out as per the food removal method showed noticeable differences in the feeding preferences of Noctiluca and copepods, especially on the different size fractions of phytoplankton. Noctiluca showed the highest positive electivity for the phytoplankton micro-fraction (av. 0.49 +/- 0.04), followed by nano-fraction (av. 0.17 +/- 0.04) and a negative electivity for the pico-fraction (av. -0.66 +/- 0.06). In total ingestion of Noctiluca, micro-fraction contribution (83.7%) was significantly higher compared to the nano-(15.7%) and pico-fractions (0.58%). On the other hand, copepods showed the highest positive electivity for the phytoplankton nano-fraction (av. 0.38 +/- 0.04) followed by micro-(av. -0.17 +/- 0.05) and pico-fractions (av. -0.35 +/- 0.05). Similarly, in total ingestion of copepods, nano-fraction (69.7%) was the highest followed by micro-(28.9%) and pico-fractions (1.37%). The grazing pressure of Noctiluca on the total phytoplankton was found to be 27.7% of the standing stock and 45.6% of the production, whereas in the case of copepods, it was 9.95% of the standing stock and 16.6% of the production. The study showed that the grazing pressure of Noctiluca on the total phytoplankton as well as larger phytoplankton fraction was 2.8-and 8-folds higher than that of the copepods. This suggests the leading role of Noctiluca as an effective grazer of larger phytoplankton along the southwest west coast of India, especially during the Peak/Late Southwest Monsoon.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0167-6369	1573-2959		WOS:000404652900048	28646438

Using 12 km transects, doliolid blooms were encountered at a horizontal scale of about 2-3 km, which corresponds to submesoscale physical events. Doliolids were also consistently encountered in the subsurface layer above the pycnocline in warmer (> 14 degrees C) and higher-salinity (> 34) water masses, and seawater density was the most critical factor affecting distribution depth. Compared to previous studies, the density and biomass of the blooms observed in this study (77 mgC m(-3) and 4600 inds m(-3)) were highest in the open ocean. Bloom formation consisted of two phases; first, the seeding population of a nurse stage increased rapidly to 2000 inds m(-3) by asexual reproduction, followed by asexual production of phorozooids. Estimated population clearance rates revealed that these dense patches could potentially sweep the surrounding water within 2-3 d. The incidence of exhausted and shrunken zooids was significantly correlated with patch density, suggesting that mortality was due to overgrazing. Shrunken doliolids appeared to sink below the pycnocline, corresponding to 8-17% of the particulate organic carbon flux at 150 m. Hydromedusae, pelagic polycheates, and sapphirinid copepods preyed on the doliolids. These results indicate that doliolids, which were seeded by populations originating from the Kuroshio, formed dense blooms in response to submesoscale physical events and would alter the sinking particle properties (i.e., biological pump) and the epipelagic food web structure through their grazing and mortality.									10	0	0	0	10	0	11			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000362227500021

And, these habitats are affected by anthropogenic influences such as agriculture conversion and production of livestock. In our four-year field study, we examined the space use and habitat selection of Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) during the nonbreeding season in an area of private grasslands managed for livestock production within the Northern Campos ecoregion of Uruguay. We radio-tracked sandpipers during the nonbreeding season to test the hypothesis that space use, habitat selection, and flock size were determined by vegetative structure in managed grasslands with different grazing and agricultural management regimes. We captured and tagged 62 sandpipers during the nonbreeding season in the austral summer, and recorded a total of 506 locations for our sample of radio-marked birds. Foraging Upland Sandpipers primarily selected two types of native grasslands associated with shallow, rocky soils. The vegetation configuration of disturbed pastures were open landscapes that were good for detection of arthropod prey but offered little cover for avoidance of predators. Sandpipers were usually found in small groups of 2-20 birds, and the largest flocks of 40-50 birds were found in pastures with relatively short grass cover (20 to 40% tall grass cover). Low to moderate stocking densities of domestic livestock created variation in vegetation height and cover in large areas and allowed for coexistence of grassland birds with different habitat requirements. Upland Sandpipers preferred disturbed areas, which may not support the needs of other species of grasslands birds. Our results emphasize the need for habitat heterogeneity and disturbance forces such as grazing in grassland systems. Our research contributes new information on the ecology of migratory grassland birds and provides insights for biodiversity conservation on private lands used for livestock production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1712-6568			WOS:000510174100018

An in situ enclosure experiment was conducted in a deep reservoir of southern China to examine (i) the effects of a low biomass (4 g wet weight m-3) of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and nutrients on the plankton community and (ii) the response of Daphnia to eutrophication. 2. In the absence of fish, Daphnia galeata dominated the zooplankton community, whereas calanoids were dominant in the fish treatments, followed by D. galeata. Silver carp stocking significantly reduced total zooplankton biomass, and that of D. galeata and Leptodorarichardi, but markedly increased the biomass of smaller cladocerans, copepod nauplii and rotifers. In contrast, nutrient enrichment had no significant effect on the plankton community except for cyclopoids. 3. Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta were dominant phytoplankton groups during the experiment. Chlorophyta with high growth rates (mainly Chlorella vulgaris in the fish enclosures and Ankyra sp. in the fishless enclosures) eventually dominated the phytoplankton community. Total phytoplankton biomass and the biomass of edible phytoplankton [greatest axial linear dimension (GALD) < 30 mu m], Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cyanobacteria showed positive responses to fish stocking, while inedible phytoplankton (GALD = 30 mu m) was significantly reduced in the fish enclosures. However, there was no significant effect on the plankton community from the interaction of fish and nutrients. 4. Overall, the impact of fish on the plankton community was much greater than that of nutrients. High total phosphorus concentrations in the control treatment and relatively low temperatures may reduce the importance of nutrient enrichment. These results suggest it is not appropriate to use a low biomass of silver carp to control phytoplankton biomass in warmer, eutrophic fresh waters containing large herbivorous cladocerans.									15	1	0	0	13	0	16			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000312538400008

The study encompassed the warmest period on record, with large cod stock and both low (2004-2007) and high (2008-2013) abundance of Barents Sea cod's main prey, capelin (Mallotus villosus). Feeding on capelin was most important in winter. Energy acquisition (kJ . day(-1)) was higher during fall, but in years with high capelin abundance the seasonal difference was smaller. There was no difference in energy acquisition in years with high and low capelin abundance, underpinning recent findings on decoupling between capelin abundance and cod demography. Compensatory feeding on alternative prey takes place in fall, but not in winter. These findings were consistent across age groups. The results found for energy acquisition was mirrored in growth; in years with low capelin abundance, there was a seasonal difference in growth, whereas in years with high capelin abundance, the difference was absent.

To determine if depth distributions shifted coincident with the early 1990s colonization of Lake Ontario by exotic Dreissena mussels, we calculated mean depth of capture for each of the three species during trawl surveys conducted annually during 1978-1997 and examined the means for significant deviations from established patterns. We found that mean capture depth of alewives, rainbow smelt, and age-2 lake trout shifted deeper during the build up of the dreissenid population in Lake Ontario but that timing of the shift varied among seasons and species. Depth shifts occurred first for rainbow smelt and age-2 lake trout in June 1991. In 1992, alewives shifted deeper in June followed by age-2 lake trout in July-August. Finally, in 1993 and 1994, the distribution of lake trout and alewives shifted in April-May. Reasons why the three fishes moved to deeper water are not clear, but changes in distribution were not linked to temperature. Mean temperature of capture after the depth shift was significantly lower than before the depth shift except for alewives in April-May. Movement of alewives, rainbow smelt, and age-2 lake trout to colder, deeper water has the potential to alter growth and reproduction schedules by exposing the fish to different temperature regimes and to alter the food chain, increasing predation on Mysis relicta in deep water and decreasing alewife predation on lake trout fry over nearshore spawning grounds in spring.									57	0	0	0	58	0	59			0002-8487			WOS:000165422300003

We estimated consumption dynamics of walleye, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass during 3 years that differed in age-0 yellow perch year-class strength and evaluated the relative contribution of each predator to age-0 yellow perch mortality, in Oneida Lake, New York, USA. Habitat-specific diet composition and population densities were integrated with temperature and growth rates to parameterize a bioenergetics model and estimate annual consumption of major diet items. Walleye were the dominant predator in both offshore and inshore habitats, while smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were also important inshore predators. Consumption of age-0 yellow perch by all three predators was positively correlated to age-0 yellow perch year-class strength, but our ability to account for age-0 yellow perch mortality decreased during years when year-class strength was strong. Within each year, predation by the three species accounted for all observed age-0 yellow perch mortality in late summer and fall, but not in the early summer, suggesting other predators in the lake likely predate on the youngest, most vulnerable yellow perch. These results are important for understanding how diverse predator communities can alter the spatial and temporal availability of prey refuges and influence mortality of a shared prey.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000419644500003

Pitfall-trapping was used to survey lizards across the northern edges of four forest fragments, to determine if lizards displayed characteristic responses across the edge, and whether these could be explained by the different habitat conditions. At each site, 11 equally spaced drift fences (each parallel to the edge) were arranged in a transect running perpendicular to the edge, and stretching 50 m into each habitat type. Captures of Amphibolurus muricatus (Agamidae) decreased substantially across the edge from the mine-path to the forest so that it was identified as a mine-path specialist lizard species. Captures of two skink species decreased across the mine-path before reaching the edge, and were not caught (Ctenotus taeniolatus) or were seldom caught (Ctenotus robustus) in the forest, so they were identified as mine-path specialist, edge avoiding, lizard species. Captures of Lampropholis delicata (Scincidae) increased across edges into the forest, consistent with the expectation for a forest specialist. Regression analyses indicated the responses to edges of three lizard species (A. muricatus, C. robustus and C. taeniolatus) were negatively correlated with canopy cover (probably due to its influence on temperature, as captures of A. muricatus and C. robustus were also correlated positively with mean daily temperature). In addition, the response of C. robustus correlated negatively with a vegetation factor (dense, even vegetation in the first 50 cm from ground level). The response of L. delicata correlated positively with understorey height. We have identified edge response strategies for four species of lizards across edges delimiting temperate open-forest and mined areas, and identified habitat and microclimate variables that may have driven these responses.									18	0	0	0	16	0	18			1442-9985	1442-9993		WOS:000227837500006

Here, we evaluate biogeographic shell shape variation in the marine gastropod Trophon geversianus across most of its distributional range, covering 14 degrees of latitude. Samples come from death assemblages which have the potential to unveil biogeographic patterns along spatio-temporal scales and are not affected by short-term volatility in comparison with living assemblages. We performed morphometric analyses on shells from death assemblages, and compared shape variation between mid-Holocene and modern shells from one southern site. Multivariate analyses identified two morphotypes matching the biogeographic regions of the Argentine Sea that segregates a warm-temperate from a cold-temperate zone. The Magellan province morphotype is characterized by a larger shell, lower spire height, and higher aperture length than the Argentinean province morphotype. This change in shell shape is significantly correlated to sea surface temperature, even after accounting for spatial autocorrelation, which could be indirectly influencing intraspecific morphoclines via shifts in growth rates. On the other side, shell size and shape variations were also detected (size increase over recent geological time) between mid-Holocene and modern specimens at the Beagle Channel, which could be attributed to paleoenvironmental changes and to shifts in predator-prey relationships. Our study illustrates the usefulness of death assemblages for revealing large-scale patterns of shell-shape variability in mollusk species, and highlights the spatial coincidence of intraspecific morphological differentiation with the transition zone between biogeographic provinces of the Argentine Sea.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0883-1351	1938-5323		WOS:000451814300002

To determine the effect of prey quantity and temperature on nest demography of social wasps (Polistes fuscatus ), field experiments were conducted, in which wasps were provided with a low quantity of caterpillars (approximately nest subsistence level) or high quantity (three times as much). In addition, in the third year, the nest boxes were modified to be relatively cool (white and insulated) or warm (black).2. In 1997 and 1998, high-food nests had a high proportion of cells containing developing offspring, produced more offspring, and had disproportionately more female offspring compared with low-food nests.3. In 1999, the cool and warm nest boxes exhibited a daily average difference of 1.3 degreesC and a maximum difference of 6.9 degreesC. The warm high-food nests produced more offspring than any other treatment. The cool high-food nests produced similar numbers of offspring as the cool low-food and warm low-food treatments.4. As indicated by a surplus of uncapped cells, foundresses of low-food nests, which would have had the egg-laying potential to produce many offspring, apparently sacrificed eggs to provide a food supplement for the developing offspring. This pattern plus more time observed foraging suggests considerable expenditure of energy by foundresses, in response to the low supply of food.5. Importantly, these results indicate that an interactive effect of prey quantity and temperature on offspring production occurred, which may reflect the different effects on developmental rate and growth rate at cool versus warm nest temperatures.									13	0	1	0	12	0	14			0307-6946			WOS:000183157100008

J	Loeng, Harald; Drinkwater, Ken								An overview of the ecosystems of the Barents and Norwegian Seas and their response to climate variability								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY				54	23-26			2478	2500		10.1016/j.dsr2.2007.08.013				2007	2007	The principal features of the marine ecosystems in the Barents and Norwegian Seas and some of their responses to climate variations are described. The physical oceanography is dominated by the influx of warm, high-salinity Atlantic Waters from the south and cold, low-salinity waters from the Arctic. Seasonal ice forms in the Barents Sea with maximum coverage typically in March-April. The total mean annual primary production rates are similar in the Barents and Norwegian Seas (80-90 g cm(-2)), although in the Barents, the production is higher in the Atlantic than in the ice covered Arctic Waters. The zooplanklon is dominated by Calanus species, C. finmarchicus in the Atlantic Waters of the Norwegian and Barents Seas, and C glacialis in the Arctic Waters of the Barents Sea. The fish species in the Norwegian Sea are mostly pelagics Such as herring (Clupea harengus) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), while in the Barents Sea there are both pelagics (capelin (Mallotus uillosus Muller), herring, and polar cod (Boreogadus saida Lepechin)) and demersals (cod (Gadus morhua L.) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus)). The latter two species spawn in the Norwegian Sea along the slope edge (haddock) or along the coast (cod) and drift into the Barents Sea. Marine mammals and seabirds, although comprising only a relatively small percentage of the biomass and production in the region, play an important role as consumers of zooplankton and small fish. While top-down control by predators certainly is significant within the two regions, there is also ample evidence of bottom-up control. Climate variability influences the distribution of several fish species, such as cod, herring and blue whiting, with northward shifts during extended warm periods and southward movements during cool periods. Climate-driven increases in primary and secondary production also lead to increased fish production through higher abundance and improved growth rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A dense population of filter-feeding ascidians Ciona intestinalis (up to 270 individuals m(-2)) had a significant controlling impact on the phytoplankton biomass. Also, small jellyfish Aurelia aurita were present in extremely high densities (up to 300 individuals m(-3)) controlling the zooplankton population. During a long period of calm and warm weather in the summer of 1992 the filamentous algal mat rose from the sediment surface. High amounts of nutrients were then released to the water column causing a phytoplankton bloom (up to 120 mu g chlorophyll a l(-1)), but the zooplankton biomass remained low due to intense predation by the A. aurita population. It is concluded that Kertinge Nor is an unstable eutrophic ecosystem in which interactions between suspension-feeding organisms and mobilization of nutrients from the sediment pool (enhanced by a former sewage disposal) control the biological structure.

Spring collections from 2 consecutive years of El Nino conditions, 1997 and 1998, 1 year of La Nina conditions, 1999, and 1 non-anomalous year, 1995, were examined. During spring of 1997, the first year of the El Nino event, early-juvenile hake appeared to compensate for anomalous ocean conditions by ingesting a wider variety of zooplankton taxa and sizes. Continuation of El Nino conditions through spring 1998 appeared to have a strong impact on the 1998 year class. Very low levels of macrozooplankton biomass in February 1998 resulted in poor growth and reduced survival of hake from early spawns.									10	0	0	0	8	0	11			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000178457600022

Foraging trip duration, diet, energy expenditure, and chick growth of Streaked Shearwaters Calonectris leucomelas were compared between two colonies, one on Mikura Island located in the warm and less productive waters of the Kuroshio current, and the other on Sangan Island located in the cold and more productive waters of the Kuroshio/Oyashio transition zone. Parent shearwaters breeding on Mikura alternated between short (<= 3 days) trips to Kuroshio waters in order to provision their chicks and long (>3 days) trips to the cold Oyashio region in order to accumulate energy reserves for themselves. Shearwaters breeding on Sangan mainly took short trips (<= 2 days) to the nearby Kuroshio/Oyashio transition zone, but also took longer trips (>2 days) to the cold Oyashio region. Parent shearwaters breeding on Mikura, however, made more frequent long trips (24%) than those breeding on Sangan (9%). Parents at both colonies commonly brought Japanese Anchovy Engraulis japonica and Darkedged-wing Flyingfish Cypselurus hiraii for their young, while parents on Mikura also brought Pacific Saury Cololabis saira and stomach oil after long trips. Parents on Mikura delivered energy at a lower rate, resulting in lower chick growth rates and smaller fledging masses than on Sangan. Unlike other Procellariiformes seabirds, shearwater parents on Sangan accumulate their own body reserves even during the chick rearing period because of better foraging efficiency than on Mikura. This may indicate that chicks were satiated by the meals delivered to them allowing parents to utilize the remaining provisions for their own body reserves.									2	0	0	0	2	1	2			1347-0558			WOS:000380826600013		
J	BOON, PJ								DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF TRICHOPTERA LARVAE IN THE RIVER NORTH TYNE FOLLOWING THE COMMENCEMENT OF HYDROELECTRIC POWER-GENERATION								REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT				8	3			211	224		10.1002/rrr.3450080302				AUG 1993	1993	Following turbine installation at the Kielder dam, the River North Tyne downstream is now characterized by large daily fluctuations in flow. A survey of trichopteran populations (Hydropsychidae, Rhyacophilidae and Polycentropodidae) was carried out to assess the impact of hydroelectric power generation (Phase III), and to compare the results with similar pre-impoundment (Phase I) and post-impoundment (Phase II) surveys. Benthic samples were collected quarterly upstream from the reservoir and at four stations downstream. Although the same three species (Hydropsyche siltalai, Hydropsyche pellucidula and Rhyacophila dorsalis) continue to dominate, there were some notable differences found between sampling sites. Species diversity was drastically reduced at the station nearest the dam, where 99% of all larvae collected were R. dorsalis. At the next station 5 km downstream, where previously H. siltalai had been dominant, R. dorsalis now constitutes 65% of collections. At the two stations farthest away from the dam the former prevalence of H. siltalai was re-established. It is suggested that the unstable, high flows at the reservoir outlet are likely to favour the predatory R. dorsalis rather than the filter feeding hydropsychids whose nets may be susceptible to damage. Upstream from Kielder Water, R. dorsalis was prominent in benthic samples, whereas numbers of H. siltalai were 10 times lower than in Phase II and 60 times lower than in Phase I. The extent to which such upstream changes may be related to altered patterns of community structure below the dam is not known, but these observations may warrant a more cautious approach when considering upstream areas as unaffected 'reference sites'. Instar analyses suggested that winter-warm, summer-cool discharges were continuing to modify larval growth rates, as noted in Phase II. The results of this study are discussed in relation to present trends in water resource development in Britain, especially with regard to future needs in monitoring and research.									22	0	0	0	17	0	22			0886-9375			WOS:A1993LV74400001

Migration to deeper water layers during the day to escape visually hunting predators is most likely to require physiological adaptations to periodically changing temperatures. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) play crucial roles in membrane temperature acclimation. Exposure to cold temperatures typically results in an increase in the relative abundance of PUFA in cell membranes and PUFA requirements of Daphnia increase with decreasing temperatures. To assess the role of dietary PUFA in coping with temperature fluctuations experienced during DVM, we reared Daphnia magna at either constantly warm or fluctuating temperatures, simulating DVM both with and without dietary PUFA supplementation. We show that the well-known positive effect of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation on offspring production and population growth rates of D. magna is more pronounced at alternating temperatures than at constantly warm temperatures. Exposure to alternating temperatures caused modification in body PUFA concentrations and, consequently, increased lipid peroxidation. However, detrimental effects of lipid peroxidation were not evident. Our data demonstrate that the capacity to cope with the distinct temperature fluctuations experienced during DVM increases with dietary eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation, suggesting that an adequate dietary PUFA supply is crucial especially for migrating Daphnia populations. A dietary deficiency in long-chain PUFA may thus severely constrain predator evasion, potentially resulting in increased mortality and cascading effects on lower trophic levels.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000479882000001

Eagles nesting on the west coast had less frequent prey-delivery rates (3.2 +/- 1.0 deliveries/d, N = 6 nests) than those nesting on the east coast (7.2 +/- 2.8 deliveries/d, N = 7 nests). Prey-delivery rates were negatively correlated with precipitation on the west coast, but not on the east coast. On both coasts, prey delivery rates were negatively related with temperature (r = -0.45), as nestlings have lower energetic needs during warm weather, and positively related with adult attendance (r = 0.35). Prey-delivery rates were highest at intermediate tide height and early in the day, reflecting food availability. Intertidal fish were a major component of eagle diet on the east coast (plainfin midshipman [Porichthys notatus] = 46% by frequency) while pelagic fish were the major component on the west coast (Pacific mackerel [Scomber japonicus] = 92%). We concluded that landscape features (e.g., tidal flats) and weather (e.g., rain and temperature) interact to influence provisioning rates of Bald Eagles on Vancouver Island, and that these factors may drive spatial variation in eagle productivity.									20	0	0	0	19	0	21			0892-1016	2162-4569		WOS:000229221600001

A palaeohistological analysis suggests ectothermy								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				131	1			154	162		10.1093/biolinnean/blaa081				SEP 2020	2020	Most Notosuchia were active terrestrial predators. A few were semi-aquatic, or were insectivorous, omnivorous or herbivorous. A question relative to their thermometabolism remains to be answered: were Notosuchia warm-blooded? Here we use quantitative bone palaeohistology to answer this question. Two variables were used as proxies to infer thermometabolism: resting metabolic rate and red blood cell dimensions. Resting metabolic rate was inferred using relative primary osteon area and osteocyte size, shape and density. Blood cell dimensions were inferred using harmonic mean canal diameter and minimum canal diameter. All inferences were performed using phylogenetic eigenvector maps. Both sets of analyses suggest that the seven species of Notosuchia sampled in this study were ectotherms. Given that extant Neosuchia (their sister group) are also ectotherms, and that archosaurs were primitively endotherms, parsimony suggests that endothermy may have been lost at the node Metasuchia (Notosuchia-Neosuchia) by the Early Jurassic. Semi-aquatic taxa such as Pepesuchus may have had thermoregulatory strategies similar to those of recent crocodylians, whereas the terrestrial taxa (Araripesuchus, Armadillosuchus, Iberosuchus, Mariliasuchus, Stratiotosuchus) may have been thermoregulators similar to active predatory varanids. Thermal inertia may have contributed to maintaining a stable temperature in large notosuchians such as Baurusuchus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000580983800012

Rodent populations in many parts of the world fluctuate in response to resource pulses generated by periodic high seed production (masting) by forest trees, with cascading effects on predation risk to other forest species. In New Zealand forests, populations of exotic house mice (Mus musculus) irrupt after periodic heavy beech (Nothofagus spp.) seedfall. However, in alpine grasslands, where snow tussock grasses (Chionochloa spp.) also flower and set seeds periodically, little is known about house mouse population dynamics.Aims. Our primary objective was to test for an increase in alpine mouse density following a summer when snow tussocks flowered profusely. We also estimated mouse density in adjacent montane forest over 2 years, and assessed mouse diet, to predict their potential impacts on native species.Methods. Flowering intensity of Chionochloa was assessed by counting flowering tillers on permanent transects (2003-06). Mouse density was estimated with capture-mark-recapture trapping in alpine (2003-07) and forest (2003-04) habitats. Mice were also collected and their stomach contents analysed. Flowering or fruiting of alpine shrubs and herbs, and beech seedfall at forest sites, were also measured.Key results. Chionochloa flowered profusely in austral summer 2005/06. Between autumn (May) and spring (November) 2006, mean alpine mouse density increased from 4 ha(-1) to 39 ha(-1), then declined to 8 ha(-1) by autumn (May 2007). No mice were captured in 768 trap-nights during the following spring (November 2007). Prior to the mouse irruption, mouse density was consistently higher at alpine (0.4-4.0 mice ha(-1)) than at montane forest (0.02-1.8 mice ha(-1)) sites (in 2003-04). Alpine mouse diet was dominated by arthropods before mast flowering, and by seeds during it.Conclusions. The density and dynamics of alpine mice in relation to intensive snow-tussock flowering were similar to those in New Zealand beech forest in relation to beech masts.Implications. We predict the timing and duration of periods of heightened predation risk to native alpine fauna, as the result of pulses in mouse density and likely associated pulses in the density of stoats (Mustela erminea), a key exotic predator.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			1035-3712	1448-5494		WOS:000276694700002

Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500			Dominant macrobenthic populations experience sustained impacts from annual disposal of fine sediments on sandy beaches								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				508				1	15		10.3354/meps10870				AUG 4 2014	2014	Despite increasing use of dredged materials as beach fill to protect coastal property and public beaches from storm damage, knowledge of how this practice affects sandy beach ecosystems remains poor. We coupled field monitoring of 2 successive beach disposal events with mesocosm experiments to assess mechanisms of ecological effects of fine sediment disposal. Macrobenthic sampling on Topsail Island, North Carolina, revealed that disposal of dredge spoils transformed beach grain sizes from medium to fine sand. Water sampling documented substantially elevated surf-zone turbidity during and occasionally after sediment deposition. When disposal occurred before spring invertebrate recruitment to the beach, it negatively influenced recruitment of the mole crab Emerita talpoida and the amphipod Parahaustorius longimerus. When disposal followed recruitment, it affected abundances of the bean clam Donax variabilis and 3 species of haustoriid amphipods negatively, and abundance of the spionid polychaete Scolelepis squamata positively. Effects lasted for the full warm season, and suppressions of invertebrate abundances were repeated across successive annual disposal events. In mesocosms, turbidity matching that induced in the field slowed growth of clams and modified habitat choices by predatory fishes. Hence, annual disposal of fine-grained dredge spoils on these sandy beaches maintained depressed abundances of 5 of 6 macroinvertebrate prey of shorebird and surf fish, without sustaining elevated volumes of beach sediments as long as a year. Implementation of disposal projects before the beginning of the seasonal recruitment of benthos resulted in fewer negative impacts on abundance than disposal projects conducted after the recruitment season, probably reflecting a more universal risk from burial and suffocation.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000341168300001

Information from the 1980s benthic investigations., published accounts of ENP gray whale population trends and the occurrence in 1999-2000 of an unusual number of gray whale mortalities prompted concern that the whale population may have exceeded the carrying capacity of its food base. Therefore, during two cruises per year between June and September, 2002 and 2003, we resampled the 20 stations occupied during the 1980s, to determine if there had been any significant changes in ampeliscid abundance and biomass. During 2002-2003, average ampeliscid dry weight biomass was about 28 +/- 10 gm(-2) (95% confidence interval), a decline of nearly 50% from maximum values in the 1980s. Amphipod length measurements indicated that the declines were due mainly to the absence of the larger animals (20-30mm length). Two hypotheses were considered regarding the amphipod declines: gray whale predation and climate. Ampeliscid production (105 kcal m(-2) yr(-1)) and gray whale energy requirements (1.6 x 10(8) kcal individual(-1) yr(-1)) indicated that as little as 3-6% of the current estimate of the ENP gray whale population could remove 10-20% of the annual ampeliscid production from the study site in 2002-2003, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that top-down control by foraging whales was the primary cause of the observed declines. A 10-yr time series of temperature near the bottom in the Bering Strait and northward transport did not reveal a consistent trend between 1990 and 2001, suggesting that climate influences were not the major cause of the observed declines. Arctic ampeliscids have slow growth rates and long generation times; therefore the ampeliscid community may require decades to recover to densities observed in the 1980s. Predicted warming trends in the northern Bering Sea could impact ampeliscid recovery by lowering primary production or altering the community composition of the benthos. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

ECOLOGY				99	9			2047	2057		10.1002/ecy.2417				SEP 2018	2018	Understanding the causal pathways through which forest insect outbreaks are triggered is important for resource managers. However, detailed population dynamics studies are hard to conduct in low-density, pre-outbreak populations because the insects are difficult to sample in sufficient numbers. Using laboratory-raised larvae installed in the field across a 1,000 km east-west gradient in Quebec (Canada) over an 11-yr period, we examined if parasitism and predation were likely to explain fluctuations in low-density spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW) populations. Parasitism rates by the two main larval parasitoid species, Elachertus cacoeciae and Tranosema rostrale, peaked during different years. This suggests that temporal fluctuations in overall parasitism were partly buffered by compensatory dynamics among parasitoid species. Still, spatial covariance analyses indicate that the residual interannual variation in parasitism rates was substantial and correlated over large distances (up to 700 km). On the other hand, interannual variation in predation rates was not spatially correlated. Piecewise structural equationmodels indicate that temporal variation in parasitism and predation does not influence temporal variation in wild SBW abundance. Spatially, however, SBWs installed in warmer locations tended to show higher parasitism rates, and these higher rates correlated with lower wild SBW population levels. Overall, the results indicate that large-scale drops in parasitism occur and could potentially contribute to SBW population increases. However, during the period covered by this study, other factors such as direct effects of weather on SBW larval development or indirect effects through host tree physiology or phenology were more likely to explain large-scale variation in wild SBW populations.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000443558200013	29893007

We compared patterns of thermoregulation in relation to microclimate and compared reproductive timing for maternity colonies of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) roosting in natural and building roosts in the prairies of southeastern Alberta. During pregnancy, bats roosting in buildings used torpor less frequently than did rock-roosting bats, but achieved lower body temperatures when torpid. Less-frequent use of torpor leaves more active days for fetal development, and bats in building roosts gave birth earlier than those in rock roosts. We observed predators and predation in rock roosts, but not in building roosts, and suggest that bats roosting in rocks use shallower torpor to remain vigilant. Patterns of torpor use suggest that bats in buildings save more energy than rock-roosting individuals by roosting in the warmer microenvironments of buildings and by achieving lower body temperatures when ambient conditions are cold and foraging is not productive. The warmer building roosts are also conducive to juvenile growth, and young building-roosting bats fledged 1-2 weeks before rock bats. We propose that advantages for bats roosting in buildings (lower predation risk, earlier births, faster juvenile growth rates, and increased energy savings) lead to greater long-term reproductive success for building-roosting bats and make buildings preferred roosts.									87	0	0	0	89	0	91			0022-2372	1545-1542		WOS:000237125800022		
J	Selman, Will								LIFE IN SKINNY WATER: OBSERVATIONS OF JUVENILE DIAMONDBACK TERRAPINS (MALACLEMYS TERRAPIN) UTILIZING SHALLOW WATER HABITATS								HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY				13	2			399	407						AUG 2018	2018	Relatively little is known about the juvenile years of many turtle species, particularly the habitats used. Prior turtle studies found that juveniles use different habitats compared to adults, and therefore, juveniles are typically undersampled. Diamondback Terrapins (Malademys terrapin) inhabit salt marsh, island, and mangrove habitats along much of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the USA. Much information is known about adult terrapin ecology, but little information exists for the juvenile life stages. While sampling for terrapins in southwestern Louisiana from 2011-2016, I captured 20 juveniles (<9.5 cm PL) by Tyke net and 15 juveniles by manual searching via airboat. Juveniles were only 3.1% of tyke net captures (0.07/net day) and 6.0% of manual searching captures (0.44/airboat hour). Juveniles were observed exclusively in shallow water habitats (< 1 m), with many captured in < 10 cm of water. Fyke net bycatch of Alligator Gar (Atradostetts spatula), a top predator, increased above this depth. Juveniles likely use shallow water for a multitude of reasons. These may include increasing survival by having fewer predators and more cryptic habitats, while also promoting higher growth rates via improved thermoregulatory opportunities (i.e., shallow, warm water), fewer osmotic challenges, and possibly competitive avoidance with adult terrapins. The lack of juveniles in prior studies is likely due to a combination of sampling methodology, habitats sampled, and crvpsis. These observations further support that high marsh is important habitat for juvenile terrapins and that such habitats should be included into terrapin and/or coastal conservation planning.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2151-0733	1931-7603		WOS:000443013600010

What is presented here is an in-depth review of research done on Neosho madtom since it was listed as threatened. The overall goal is to directly address questions put forth in the original recovery plan. Information presented provides a basis for updating the status of and current recovery plan for the Neosho madtom along with guidance as to additional research needed for Neosho madtom recovery efforts to be successful. Currently, Neosho madtoms are found in main stems of the Neosho, Cottonwood, and Spring rivers in Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. These three rivers have been altered by reservoirs, heavy metals contamination, and gravel mining. Effects of these factors were identified as areas of information needed for recovery of the species, along with a better understanding of its reproductive biology and overall ecology. Since the initial recovery plan was written, numerous research efforts have and continue to address these questions through collaborative studies involving a partnership among federal and state agencies, private landowners, and universities. Within the Spring River, Neosho madtom populations are limited by poor habitat quality in the upper section (i.e., upstream of Center Creek) and by heavy metals contamination in the lower. In the Neosho River system, the decrease in Neosho madtom densities downstream of John Redmond Reservoir seems to be related to decreased turbidity and coarser substrate. Other benthic fishes found with the Neosho madtom, such as the channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, have shown a similar change in density. Neosho mad tom population declines also have been linked to low-head dams, which result in decreased flow and increased siltation upstream and coarsening of substrate downstream. Furthermore, Neosho madtom reproductive behavior has been shown to be related to environmental cues such as photoperiod, temperature, and water velocity, thereby indicating potential for reservoir release patterns to disrupt reproduction through changes in flow. Research has shown that Neosho madtom populations are limited by different factors in different parts of the species' geographic range. Additional research is needed on Neosho madtom movement rates among gravel bars, population genetics, aging methods, age distribution within wild populations, growth rates, population viability, effects of predation, and sensitivity to environmental contaminants.					2nd International Catfish Symposium on Conservation, Ecology, and Management of Catfish, Catfish 20102nd International Catfish Symposium on Conservation, Ecology, and Management of Catfish, Catfish 2010	JUN 19-22, 2010JUN 19-22, 2010	AFS Educ Sect; AFS Fisheries Management Sect; US Fish & Wildlife Serv; Kansas Dept Wildlife & Pk; Missouri River Nat Resources Comm; Nebraska Game & Pk Commiss; AFS Missouri Chapter; Bass Pro Shops; Conservat Federat Missouri; MICRA; Smith Root Inc; Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agcy; AFS N Central Div; AFS N Central Div Rivers & Streams Tech Comm; AFS So Div; AFS Arkansas Chapter; AFS Dakota Chapter; AFS Georgia Chapter; AFS Illinois Chapter; AFS Iowa Chapter; AFS Kansas Chapter; AFS Minnesota Chapter; AFS Mississippi Chapter; AFS Nebraska Chapter; AFS Ohio Chapter; AFS S Carolina Chapter; AFS Tennessee Chapter; AFSTexas Chapter; AFS Virginia Chapter; AFS Wisconsin Chapter; Duke Energy; Minner Net Co Inc; Upper Mississippi River Conservat Comm; W Virginia Dept Nat ResourcesAFS Educ Sect; AFS Fisheries Management Sect; US Fish & Wildlife Serv; Kansas Dept Wildlife & Pk; Missouri River Nat Resources Comm; Nebraska Game & Pk Commiss; AFS Missouri Chapter; Bass Pro Shops; Conservat Federat Missouri; MICRA; Smith Root Inc; Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agcy; AFS N Central Div; AFS N Central Div Rivers & Streams Tech Comm; AFS So Div; AFS Arkansas Chapter; AFS Dakota Chapter; AFS Georgia Chapter; AFS Illinois Chapter; AFS Iowa Chapter; AFS Kansas Chapter; AFS Minnesota Chapter; AFS Mississippi Chapter; AFS Nebraska Chapter; AFS Ohio Chapter; AFS S Carolina Chapter; AFS Tennessee Chapter; AFSTexas Chapter; AFS Virginia Chapter; AFS Wisconsin Chapter; Duke Energy; Minner Net Co Inc; Upper Mississippi River Conservat Comm; W Virginia Dept Nat Resources	St Louis, MISt Louis, MI	1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0892-2284		978-1-934874-25-7	WOS:000393725100024

This involved the study, from January to December 2005, of bacteria (total number of non-pigmented bacteria; high nucleic acid content (HNA) bacteria; low nucleic acid content (LNA) bacteria), cyanobacteria (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) and heterotrophic nanoflagellates. During the warmer seasons, in the mainly oligotrophic area under investigation into the Adriatic Sea, bacterial densities and bacterial production have shown an increase in values and domination of the LNA group of the bacterial population. In contrast, in those areas influenced by karstic rivers, the domination of HNA bacteria in total abundance of non-pigmented bacteria and high values of bacterial production was estimated throughout the investigated period. Our results show the importance of both HNA and LNA bacterial groups in the total bacterial activity throughout the investigated area. The biomass of bacteria was mostly predominant in the prokaryotic community, while within the autotrophic community Synechococcus biomass mostly predominated. During the warmer seasons, an increase in autotrophic biomass was observed in relation to non-pigmented biomass. The importance of predation in controlling bacteria by heterotrophic nanoflagellates was pronounced during the warmer period and in the coastal areas.									21	0	0	0	12	0	21			1438-387X			WOS:000323623800005

Onboard observations showed that adult Sapphirina nigromaculata was an active predator of doliolids, with a preference for internal tissues. When entering a doliolid body cavity, sapphirinids left a characteristic bite mark around the fringe of oral and atrial aperture or hole on the tunic of the doliolid. In situ observations with a video plankton recorder (VPR) revealed that association between sapphirinids and doliolids was common in the field. Adult sapphirinids and doliolids exhibiting the characteristic evidence of an attack (bite mark or hole) were found in sediment traps at a depth of 50 m, indicating that the association between these taxa was due to predation. Early copepodites, which were not observed in sediment-trap samples, appeared in the VPR observations to have a semi-parasitic phase when they attached themselves to nurse chains. The maximal daily ration of sapphirinids estimated by onboard experiments ranged between 29% and 37% of their body carbon weight. Although the mean predation effect by sapphirinids on the doliolid population biomass was only 0.7% d(-1), sapphirinids potentially had a greater effect on doliolid abundance at the termination of doliolid blooms. Some of the attacked doliolids were discarded by the sapphirinids and contributed to the sinking flux below 150 m, the importance of which as a source of detritus likely increased with depth. Sapphirinids, despite their relatively low abundance in the water column, play a specific role in driving community succession and biogeochemical cycling.									18	0	0	0	17	1	21			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000327395400006

In the intertidal zone, oysters engineer ecological communities by reducing temperature and desiccation stress, enhancing the availability of hard substrate for attachment, and by ameliorating biological interactions such as competition and predation. Using a field experiment manipulating shading, predator access and availability of shell substrate at four sites distributed over 900km of east Australian coastline, we investigated how the relative importance of these mechanisms of facilitation vary spatially. At all sites, and irrespective of environmental conditions, the provision of hard substrate by oysters enhanced the abundance and richness of invertebrates, in particular epibionts (barnacles and oyster spat) and grazing gastropods. Mobile arthropods utilised the habitat provided by disarticulated dead oysters more than live oyster habitat, whereas the abundance of polychaetes and bivalves were much greater in live oysters, suggesting the oyster filter-feeding activity is important for these groups. In warmer estuaries, shading by oysters had a larger effect on biodiversity, whereas in cooler estuaries, the provision of a predation refuge by oysters played a more important role. Such knowledge of how ecosystem engineering effects vary across environmental gradients can help inform management strategies targeting ecosystem resilience via the amelioration of specific environmental stressors, or conservation of specific community assemblages.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000466216700022	30826868

The physical structures in the environment impose strong constraints on the perception and behavioral responses of both antagonists. Nevertheless, no experimental or theoretical study has tackled the issue of quantifying the role of the habitat's architecture on the joint trajectories during a predator-prey encounter. In this study, we report the influence of microtopography of forest leaf litter on the pursuit-evasion trajectories of wolf spiders Pardosa sp. attacking the wood cricket Nemobius sylvestris. Fourteen intact leaf litter samples of 1 m x 0.5 m were extracted from an oak-beech forest floor in summer and winter, with later samples having the most recently fallen leaves. Elevation was mapped at a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm using a laser scanner. Litter structuring patterns were identified by height transects and experimental semi-variograms. Detailed analysis of all visible leaf-fragments of one sample enabled us to relate the observed statistical patterns to the underlying geometry of individual elements. Video recording of pursuit-evasion sequences in arenas with flat paper or leaf litter enabled us to estimate attack and fleeing distances as a function of substrate. The compaction index, the length of contiguous flat surfaces, and the experimental variograms showed that the leaf litter was smoother in summer than in winter. Thus, weathering as well as biotic activities compacted and flattened the litter over time. We found good agreement between the size of the structuring unit of leaf litter and the distance over which attack and escape behaviors both were initiated (both similar to 3 cm). There was a four-fold topographical effect on pursuit-escape sequences; compared with a flat surface, leaf litter (1) greatly reduced the likelihood of launching a pursuit, (2) reduced pursuit and escape distances by half, (3) put prey and predator on par in terms of pursuit and escape distances, and (4) reduced the likelihood of secondary pursuits, after initial escape of the prey, to nearly zero. Thus, geometry of the habitat strongly modulates the rules of pursuit-evasion in predator-prey interactions in the wild.									13	0	0	0	12	0	13			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000326041500001	23720527

Actinophrys sol was widely-distributed throughout Chesapeake Bay and could exceed densities of 5,000 cells liter(-1). It was most abundant during the warmer months. Feeding experiments were conducted with field populations of heliozoa using 1-mu m fluorescent microspheres to label ciliate prey. Two ciliates, a small Strobilidium sp. (30 mu m in diameter) and a Pleuronema sp. (45 mu m length), were the primary ciliate-prey items in the water column when the experiments were conducted, although a wide range of ciliate taxa was ingested. Two other ciliates not present in situ, a Cyclidium sp. (20 mu m length) and a Uronema sp. (40 mu m length), were also labeled and added at various concentrations to field populations of plankton containing A. sol. Heliozoan ingestion rates on in situ prey at concentrations of 30 Strobilidium and one Pleuronema ml(-1) were 0.2 to 0.3 prey heliozoan(-1) hour(-1). Ingestion rates increased to a maximum of 1.2 prey heliozoan(-1) hour(-1) with additions of 100 Uronema ml(-1). A mean clearance rate of 0.15 ml heliozoan(-1) day(-1) did not change with increasing prey abundance. The abundance and distribution of A. sal suggests that these sarcodines may exert strong grazing pressure on the planktonic ciliate populations of Chesapeake Bay at certain times of the year, and may be important in shaping the ciliate community composition and distribution.									6	0	0	0	6	0	7			1066-5234	1550-7408		WOS:000082958900001

We measured recovery of predators on lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus L.) that were infested with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Factors thought to affect movement and colonization were distance to a receiver unit from a release (landing) point, intervening soil surfaces such as clods, gravel, fine soil and grass, and management of soil surfaces such as mulching, watering or both. In the field, the effect of distance (0.11-1.76 m) from a landing point to a receiver unit was significant, with a negative log-linear relationship. Soil surfaces such as clods and management actions such as watering with mulching allowed for more capture of predators on bean plants with prey than did other treatments. Environmental conditions greatly affected survival of N. fallacis. Predators in the field that were present on bare soil suffered high mortality (ca. 90%) at fluctuating daytime conditions of 26.4 +/- 4.8 degreesC and 56 +/- 13.4% RH. Predators only suffered 10% mortality in the greenhouse under the same setting, but under more controlled and favorable environmental conditions. Effects of environmental conditions, mode of dispersal and implications to biological control are discussed.									12	0	0	0	12	1	14			0168-8162			WOS:000165475600001	11201352

We studied thermoregulation by the broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides), a small (mean snout-vent length = 57 cm) nocturnal elapid that spends long periods sequestered in diurnal retreat sites. The snakes selected body temperatures of 28.1 degrees-31.1 degrees C in laboratory thermal gradients. Prey-capture ability (strike speed and accuracy) increased at higher body temperatures over the range 20 degrees-30 degrees C. Using temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, we obtained 7,801 body-temperature measurements of 19 free-ranging snakes. Information on operative environmental temperatures was obtained at the same time. From these data, we quantified the degree to which the snakes exploit the environmental thermal heterogeneity available to them (i.e., the time they spent within their setpoint range, relative to the total time that these body temperatures were available to them). Mean body temperatures (both diurnally and nocturnally) differed among seasons but not among different types of retreat sites. Inclement weather prevented snakes from attaining "preferred" body temperatures on 30% of days. However, even when preferred temperatures were available, the snakes exploited this opportunity for only 26% of the time: they remained within retreat sites and rarely emerged to bask. Nonetheless, judicious retreat-site selection resulted in snakes being within their set-point range for 60% of the time at the most crucial time of day (i.e., the 2-h period around dusk, when the opportunity to capture prey is highest). Basking may be rare not only because of its high potential costs (e.g., risk of avian predation) but also because high body temperatures enhance snake fitness for only a short time each day and can be attained over that short period without the "expense" of heliothermy. Our results suggest that precise thermoregulation may not be widespread among snakes, particularly small nocturnal species that spend long periods sequestered in retreat sites.									70	2	1	0	70	0	72			0031-935X			WOS:000081684800008	9798255

Understanding interspecific interactions, and the influences of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17% of ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at the community level.2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002, and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines.3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba represented 32%, and 14 other species a further 46% of the combined diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years.4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet data.5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes in seabird communities over time. Conventional dietary analysis provided better resolution of community structure than SIA. However, delta N-15 in chick feathers, which reflected trophic (level) specialization, was nevertheless an effective and less time-consuming means of monitoring temporal changes.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000368141400020	26439671	
J	McLaren, IA; Avendano, P; Taggart, CT; Lochmann, SE								Feeding by larval cod in different water-masses on Western Bank, Scotian Shelf								FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY				6	4			250	265						DEC 1997	1997	Gut contents were obtained from 1406 cod larvae from 94 stations in seven water masses related to a gyre around Western Bank, Scotian Shelf, 22 November-16 December 1992. Initial samples were from: well-mixed water over the bank crest (CW); a surrounding convergent FRONT; relatively cold, fresh water (CFW) largely east of CW; warmer, salty water (WSW) west of CW anal FRONT. After a storm on 3-6 December, samples were from CW and CFW displaced south-east on the bank and, after further winds 11-12 December, from CW displaced north-west off the bank. Zooplankton biomass (300-333 mu m mesh, mostly Calanus copepodids) did not differ among water masses, but larval concentrations were significantly higher in FRONT than elsewhere. The small-copepod diets of larvae varied among water masses, partly attributable to larval growth during the sampling period. Numbers of prey in guts, and indices of fullness and digestion, varied among water masses. More reliably, after ANCOVAs significant independent variables were: overwhelmingly time of day (maximum prey numbers and fullness at similar to 19:00) and larval size; water mass; weaker interactions of the above among themselves and with sample depth and date; a very weak negative turbulence-index effect on gut prey numbers in depth-stratified samples. After ANCOVAs, larvae from prestorm CW had significantly higher prey numbers and fullness than did those from FRONT, WSW, and CFW. Larvae in CFW were significantly fuller when sampled closer to sites of former CW after the storm. Although numbers of prey in larvae advected off the bank in CW decreased significantly, prey averaged larger, so that gut fullness did not decrease. We conclude that lan ae were best fed in the 'centre' of the Western Bank gyre, but nut greatly affected by subsequent displacement off the bank.									25	0	0	0	22	0	25			1054-6006			WOS:000072305100003

This deep-sea environment is characterized by constant and relatively warm temperature (13 +/- 0.5 degrees C) throughout the year. Two independent daily-ration estimates were produced: First, an actual daily ration was obtained by computing the weight of the fresh food items, yielding a value of 2.588 g wet food weight per 100 g shrimp wet weight. Second, the daily ration was estimated by the models of Eggers and Elliot & Persson. Daily rations for A. antennatus computed from these models ranged between 1.666 (+/-1.193) and 2.315 (+/-0.924) g wet food weight per 100 g shrimp wet weight, or between 0.130 (+/-0.115) and 0.223 (+/-0.091) g dry food weight per 100 g shrimp wet weight. The results of the 3 daily-ration models were compared and tested by bootstrap ping; they did not differ significantly. Our results are compared with daily rations reported for other marine organisms. The feeding ecology of A. antennatus is discussed in relation to the food-limited deep-sea environment which this shrimp inhabits.									33	0	0	0	27	0	33			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1997XR97400017

The water level in the wetland is maintained at 10-40cm, and water level in surrounding area is maintained in a manner so that water body is flowing. The area of planting area is 2000-3000 square meters, pH value at bottom of planting area is 7.0-8.5, and has clay or loamy soil, where area has good water retention, and a nylon film is applied to planting area up to height of 1.2-1.5m which is filled in soil up to depth of 30cm. USE - Method for performing ecological farming of spine loach and Zizania latifolia (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method enables to perform ecological farming of spine loach and Zizania latifolia, which does not occupy fertile field and pond, and produces high-quality loach and Zizania latifolia in wetland with significant economic and ecological benefit. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Performing ecological farming of spine loach and Zizania latifolia involves selecting swamp area of domestic sewage treatment area as planting area. The water level in the wetland is maintained at 10-40cm, and water level in surrounding area is maintained in a manner so that water body is flowing. The area of planting area is 2000-3000 square meters, pH value at bottom of planting area is 7.0-8.5, and has clay or loamy soil, where area has good water retention, and a nylon film is applied to planting area up to height of 1.2-1.5m which is filled in soil up to depth of 30cm, and wooden piles or bamboo piles are fixed up to height of 40cm in the soil at an interval of 1.5 meter. The pond sludge is processed for Zizania latifolia, where bottom of pond has sludge up to 15-25cm, and quicklime is scattered on bottom of pond in an amount of 25-30kg/acre. The drainage outlet of Zizania latifolia is diagonally set with water outlet which is fixed with fish blocking net, where fish blocking net is a polyethylene net of 40-60 mesh and is used to prevent predators entry to prevent the loach. The planting are is excavated up to a width of 0.5-1.0m, depth of 0.3-0.6m in the groove, and ditch having width of 0.5-1.0m and depth of 0.3-0.6m is formed on four corners of then planting area, where loach trench and loach pit are connected, and 10% of Zizania latifolia are is under control of loach area. The Zizania latifolia is planted in early March when water temperature is 8-10 degrees C, and grass seed is transplanted up to 5-10cm depth of water surface of the pond, and Zizania latifolia seed is applied to water up to a thickness of 15-20cm, and Zizania latifolia is planted at a spacing of 30-40cm and row spacing of 40-50cm. The piers are buried in bottom of pond up to depth of 15-20, where white stem part of grass is exposed to soil, tip of young grass is not submerged into bottom, and water level of Zizania latifolia in pond is maintained to 20-30cm. The spine loach and Zizania latifolia are stocked at an interval of 10-15 days, where loach species are soaked into 3-4% saline or 10ppm of potassium permanganate solution and disinfeced for 10 minutes, where loach is stocked in an amount of 5000-10000 having body length of 8-12cm. The loach species are feed after three days of stocking, where feeding is carried out by providing feed in an amount of 1-2% of loach weight, which is gradually increased to 4-5% after half of month, where feeding time is divided into morning and evening. The feed comprises fish meat, earthworm powder, soybean meal, rapeseed cake and flour in a weight ratio of 1:1:2:3:5, which are mixed to obtain mixture. The mixture is crushed to obtain powder of 40-80 mesh sieve, and water is added and mixed with powder to obtain loach feed. The water inlet is provided with Zizania latifolia for water circulation through water body, where water is changed for 5-10 hours per day, and Zizania latifolia is fed with feed. The Zizania latifolia is harvested in late June, late August and late October, where water is harvested before harvesting Zizania latifolia. The mechanical method is used to drain from planting area to make water level up to below 5cm, where cage is used to catch loach, ragweed is harvested from bottom of the stubble up to 10-15cm, and Zizania latifolia is harvested from planting area and its water level is gradually deepen to 20-30cm. The spine loach having weight of more than 20 grams are collected into cage, and placed in cage for 6-10 months, where loach is collected at end of June, August and before the end of October for 3-5 times, and small loach are moved back to the pond to continue farming, and large loach is collected into December, and the un-captured loach are collected in winter.															0						DIIDW:201777018L

However, the effects of this peculiar food web configuration on microbial compartments have not been tested experimentally. To establish which predator could be responsible for most bacterial loss in a tropical shallow lake, we performed a predation experiment manipulating consumer size fractions. We found that protists had an effect more than four times greater (-86%) than the one exerted by microcrustaceans (-20%), whereas rotifers and nauplii had a minimum effect (-8%). Thus, our results indicate that predation was a crucial factor controlling bacterial abundance and that protists (mainly ciliates) were responsible for most of this loss. Moreover, bacterial community structure was also affected by predation, with a change in the relative proportion of cytometric subpopulations (high-nucleic acid and low-nucleic acid) as a function of different degrees of predation pressure and a decrease in community evenness (assessed by cytometric diversity) with the removal of predators. Therefore, protists play an important role in controlling the abundance and maintaining prokaryotic diversity in warm regions, where zooplankton is present and controlled by juvenile fish throughout the year.									3	1	0	0	3	0	4			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000428943600003

This has led to a focus in recent literature on the identification of "hotspots'' important for migratory marine predators, i.e., regions where predators spend disproportionate amounts of time ostensibly due to high prey abundance; and determination of the environmental features characteristic of such areas. We investigated factors predicting foraging success in southern bluefin tuna (SBT; Thunnus maccoyii), by integrating telemetry-based feeding and movement data (n = 19 fish, length to caudal fork [LCF]=99 +/- 3 cm) with environmental data over the scale of their annual oceanic migrations during 1998-2000. We used widely available statistical modeling techniques, generalized linear models, and generalized linear mixed models, formulated to represent feeding as a Markov process. The results showed increased feeding and predictability of feeding occurs in the coastal waters of southern Australia, providing some evidence that this area represents a fixed foraging "hotspot'' for juvenile tuna during the austral summer. However, in oceanic waters southern bluefin tuna did not fit the common model of migration, but rather showed a pattern of relatively high foraging success throughout their migratory range, especially during periods of continuous travel. Interestingly, foraging "coldspots'' (prolonged low-feeding periods) as well as "hotspots'' were apparent across individual tracks, predicted most strongly by warm ocean temperatures. These results provide a new perspective on the ecology of large-scale feeding migrations within the context of the heterogeneous ocean environment, where the continuous and opportunistic feeding of generalist predators may be more common, particularly in predatory large pelagic fishes, than is currently documented.									50	0	0	0	43	1	50			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000280153500021	20836459

We chose our study species and populations to provide a strong test of recent theoretical predictions that optimal foraging by an apex fish predator in a typical aquatic environment would be consistent with feeding to satiation rather than continuous feeding. We chose four populations where the primary prey type differed along a body size gradient (from small invertebrates to large planktivorous fish) and along a thermal accessibility gradient (from easily accessible cold-water pelagic prey to less accessible warm-water epilimnetic and littoral prey). We expected that these gradients in prey type would evoke distinctly different activity gradients depending on whether predators fed to satiation (e.g., less frequent rest detections where primary prey are smaller/less accessible) or fed continuously (e.g., fixed level of rest detections under all prey conditions). Our study organism was a fall spawning, cold-water visual apex predator (lake trout). Therefore, we focused our study on diel (early night, dawn, day, dusk, late night) changes in metabolic costs associated with summer feeding behaviour. The duration (similar to 20days) and fine temporal scale (similar to 30min) of our behavioural data provided a uniquely detailed picture of intra- and inter-population differences in activity patterns over a critical period in the annual growing season. In all populations, diel shifts in activity were qualitatively consistent with that expected of a visual predator (e.g., resting state detections were most frequent at night). Between-lake differences in daytime thermal experience were qualitatively consistent with between-lake differences in the location of primary prey (e.g., excursions to warm habitats were common in lakes with epilimnetic/littoral fish as primary prey and relatively rare in lakes with pelagic cold-water invertebrates/fish as primary prey). Daytime activity patterns were more consistent with the feeding pattern expected from feeding to satiation rather than continuous feeding: (a) individuals in all four populations exhibited clearly delineated bouts of resting behaviour and active behaviour; (b) the frequency of resting bouts and the resultant overall cost of daily activity were strongly associated with the size and accessibility of preyin lakes with smaller and/or less accessible prey, predators rested less frequently, exhibited marginally higher costs when active and had higher overall daytime activity costs. Within each lake, similar changes in activity occurred concurrently with diel changes in prey accessibility/relative density.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000471342700005	30712263

Neither its role in vineyards nor the factors affecting its population dynamics and relationships with other phytoseiid species are well known. The development and the reproduction of I talbii were studied in the laboratory by rearing the predator on different kinds of food (Panonychus ulmi, Eotetranychus carpini, Colomerus vitis, Tydeus caudatus, Mesembryanthemum crinifliorum pollen). Overwintered females reared on tydeids survived for long periods and laid eggs, but they died after a few days when spider mites or pollen were provided. Development occurred on all mite species but not on pollen. Developmental times on tydeids were shorter than on the other prey. Oviposition was recorded on tydeids and, to a lesser extent, on eriophyids but not on spider mites or pollen. Experiments on tydeids, which resulted as being the best food, were conducted at two temperatures (20 degrees and 27 degrees C). The highest temperature affected the duration of development and oviposition rates positively, but total fecundity was similar. Predators reared at 27 degrees C consumed more prey than those reared at 20 degrees C. The life table parameters of the species were evaluated on I: caudatus (at 20 degrees and 27 degrees C) and on C. vitis. The highest r(m) of T.talbii was found for individuals reared on T. caudatus at 27 degrees C (0.165). Lower values were obtained on the same prey at 20 degrees C (0.089) or on C. vitis (0.030). The feeding habits of T. talbii may explain why the species coexists with the generalist Amblyseius aberrans or Typhlodromus pyri.									21	0	0	0	23	1	26			0013-8703			WOS:A1995TA01600004

To minimize constraints imposed by central-place foraging and to optimize foraging behavior, many species exhibit flexible foraging tactics. Here we document the behavioral flexibility of pursuit-diving common murres Uria aalge when foraging on female capelin Mallotus villosus in the northwest Atlantic. Quite unexpectedly, being visual foragers, we found that common murres dived throughout the day and night. Twenty-one percent of recorded dives (n = 272 of 1,308 dives) were deep (a parts per thousand yen50 m; maximum depth = 152 m, maximum duration = 212 s), bringing murres into sub-0A degrees C water in the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL; 40-180 m) of the Labrador Current. Deep dives occurred almost exclusively during the day when murres would have encountered spatially predictable aggregations of capelin between 100 and 150 m in the water column. Temperatures within the CIL shaped trophic interactions and involved trade-offs for both predators and prey. Sub-0A degrees C temperatures limit a fish's ability to escape from endothermic predators by reducing burst/escape speeds and also lengthening the time needed to recover from burst-type activity. Thus, while deep diving may be energetically costly, it likely increases certainty of prey capture. Decreased murre foraging efficiency at night (indicated by an increase in the number of dives per bout) reflects both lower light conditions and changing prey behavior, as capelin migrate to warmer surface waters at night where their potential to escape from avian predators could increase.									49	0	0	0	42	0	50			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000263380800019

Competição é uma interação tão relevante quanto a predação para cladóceros planctônicos tropicais?							Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia				30				e1	e1		10.1590/s2179-975x0917				2018	2018	Abstract Aim To test the relevance of competition and predation for the two most abundant and frequent cladoceran populations, the medium-sized Ceriodaphnia richardi Sars, 1901 and the large-sized Daphnia gessneri Herbst, 1967, in a tropical shallow lake. Methods Laboratory experiments and weekly samplings in the lake for a year were performed to evaluate: density fluctuations and reproduction; predation on juveniles and adults by larvae of Chaoborus brasiliensis Theobald, 1901; competitive interactions and possible implications of competition and predation on the fluctuations of populations in the lake. Juveniles and adults of both cladocerans were offered to larvae instar IV of chaoborid, for testing selective predation in laboratory experiment. Competitive interaction between the two cladocerans was tested in experiments, with high (0.70 mg C.L-1) and low (0.25 mg C.L-1) concentrations of the edible chlorophycean Desmodesmus spinosus Chodat. Results C. richardi and D. gessneri were more abundant in the cool season, when their densities were inversely correlated, and when invertebrate predators, C. brasiliensis and the water mite Krendowskia sp., were less abundant. Despite higher concentrations of food and larger number of offsprings produced by the cladocerans in the warm season in the lake, their densities were lower, coincident with the increase of invertebrate predators, mainly chaoborid larvae. C. brasiliensis preyed on adult C. richardi and on young D. gessneri. In the competition experiments, the densities and the population growth rates of C. richardi were higher than those of D. gessneri. The competition results support the “small body size” and the “rmax” hypotheses. The exclusion of D. gessneri by C. richardi occurred only in experimental conditions, while they coexist in the lake, but without reaching their carrying capacity. Conclusions Predation is the key factor influencing the populations of cladocerans, whereas competition seems to play a secondary role, probably restricted to some periods of lower food concentration in the cool season.		Resumo Objetivo Testar a relevância da competição e da predação para as duas populações de cladóceros mais abundantes e frequentes, a de tamanho médio Ceriodaphnia richardi Sars, 1901, e a de tamanho grande Daphnia gessneri Herbst, 1967, em um lago tropical raso. Métodos Foram feitos experimentos de laboratório e amostragens semanais durante um ano para avaliar: flutuações de densidade e reprodução; predação sobre jovens e adultos por larvas de Chaoborus brasiliensis Theobald, 1901; interações competitivas e possíveis implicações da competição e predação sobre as flutuações das populações no lago. Jovens e adultos de ambos os cladóceros foram oferecidos às larvas de estádio IV de caoborídeos, para testar predação seletiva em experimento de laboratório. A interação competitiva entre os dois cladóceros foi testada em experimentos com alta (0,70 mg C.L-1) e baixa (0,25 mg C.L-1) concentrações da clorofícea comestível Desmodesmus spinosus Chodat. Resultados C. richardi e D. gessneri foram mais abundantes na estação fria, quando suas densidades foram inversamente correlacionadas e quando os predadores invertebrados, C. brasiliensis e o ácaro aquático Krendowskia sp., foram menos abundantes. Apesar de concentrações mais elevadas de alimento e maior número de descendentes produzidos pelos cladóceros na estação quente no lago, suas densidades foram menores, coincidindo com o aumento dos predadores invertebrados, principalmente caoborídeos. C. brasiliensis predou adultos de C. richardi e jovens de D. gessneri. Nos experimentos sobre competição, as densidades e as taxas de crescimento populacional de C. richardi foram maiores do que as de D. gessneri. Os resultados da competição apoiam as hipóteses de “pequeno tamanho” e “rmax”. A diferença entre os resultados de campo e laboratório é que a exclusão de D. gessneri por C. richardi ocorreu apenas em condições experimentais, enquanto estas espécies coexistem no lago, mas sem atingir sua capacidade de suporte. Conclusões A predação é o fator chave que influencia as populações de cladóceros, enquanto a competição parece desempenhar um papel secundário, provavelmente restrito a alguns períodos de menor concentração de alimento na estação fria.							1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2179-975X			SCIELO:S2179-975X2018000100301

The distribution of zooplankton biomass in this region was examined as a means of finding out why the SET are attracted to this area. We examined whether there was a particular area or depth stratum that supported significantly greater amounts of potential feed, directly or indirectly, for SET. Samples of zooplankton and micronekton were collected during the winter SET fishery seasons in 1992-94. Five net types (mouth opening 0.25 to similar to 80 m(2)) with codend mesh sizes ranging from 100 to 1000 mu m were used. Samples were collected from 4 main hydrographic areas: warm East Australian Current water, cool subantarctic water, the front separating them (the subtropical convergence), and the adjacent shelf. Four depth strata (50, 150, 250 and 350 m) were also sampled. In contrast to our expectations, the biomass in the subtropical convergence was no greater than that in the 3 other areas. Rather, it was the shelf, albeit with some inconsistencies, that generally had the greatest biomass of both zooplankton and micronekton. Offshore, there was no significant difference in the biomass of the depth strata sampled, although the biomass of gelatinous zooplankton in the surface waters increased during the study period. We suggest that the higher biomass on the shelf is the result of increased nutrients derived from a mixture of subantarctic water and upwelling along the shell break. This biomass is converted via krill and gelatinous zooplankton to small pelagics such as jack mackerel, and finally to top predators, amongst which is SET. The SET, particularly sub-adults, may time their migration eastward to take advantage of the concentrations of prey present at this time of year.									44	0	0	0	41	0	46			0171-8630			WOS:A1996VC14700001		
J	STEEGER, C; ESSELINK, H; YDENBERG, RC								COMPARATIVE FEEDING ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE OF OSPREYS IN DIFFERENT HABITATS OF SOUTHEASTERN BRITISH-COLUMBIA								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE				70	3			470	475		10.1139/z92-071				MAR 1992	1992	We compared the general breeding and feeding ecology of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in the Creston and Nelson areas of southeastern British Columbia. In the Creston Valley, ospreys nested atop tall trees surrounding a shallow and productive warm-water marsh. Prey species taken by male ospreys included black bullhead (Ictalurus melas), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). In contrast, near Nelson, ospreys nested on man-made structures along the narrow West Arm of Kootenay Lake. Osprey prey species in the Nelson area included longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), largescale sucker (Catostomus macrocheilus), and mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni). Prey captured at Nelson were larger and contained significantly more energy than at Creston Valley, and hunting from a perch was used for 26 % of all captures. All Creston Valley prey were caught by flight hunting. The strike success of foraging ospreys at Nelson was significantly higher than at Creston, and the net yield of flight hunting was 3 times higher. In spite of these differences, the breeding performance of ospreys in the two areas was very similar. Average clutch size was 2.8, brood size at hatching was 2.0, and the average pair fledged 1.4 young. The nest failure rate did not differ between the two areas. Most clutches were initiated in early May. with Nelson-area ospreys laying, on average, 4-7 days later. Egg volumes were smaller at Nelson (66.6 vs. 69.1 cm3). However, the rate at which nestlings gained mass was significantly greater at Nelson. We discuss reasons why the breeding performance varies so little in spite of the great differences in feeding regime.									12	0	0	0	13	0	14			0008-4301			WOS:A1992JA42800010

The North Pacific heat wave interacted with an El Nino developing in the equatorial Pacific in 2015. Weekly periods of exceptionally high temperature anomalies (>2 degrees C) occurred until the start of the El Nino (winter of 2015), when SSTs were still high but not as high as those due to the marine heat wave. During the 2015-16 El Nino, the depth of the 26.0 kg m(-3) isopycnal (d(26.0)) was considerably shallower than during the -1982-83 and 1997-98 events. The area affected by the marine heat wave and the 2015-16 El Nino in the mixed layer was comparable to the 1997-98 El Nino, but lasted longer. Water column stratification in the upper 100 m during 2015-16 was as strong as the most extreme values during the 1997-98 El Nino. This stratification was primarily driven by the warming of the upper 100 m. Despite notable perturbations, the effects of the -2015-16 El Nino on hydrographic properties in the CalCOFI domain were not as strong as those observed during the 1997-98 El Nino.Warm ocean conditions, stratification, nutrient suppression, and silicic acid stress likely favored initiation of a toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom in fall 2014. Very low zooplankton displacement volumes were associated with anomalously warm and saline surface waters off Baja California. In contrast, during the 1997-98 El Nino, zooplankton volume was near average. Off California, pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) adults were abundant in the water column and frequently washed up on beaches of southern California from January 2015 into 2016, and central California by September 2015. Glider measurements of integrated transport up to June 2015 did not detect anomalous northward advection. As expected, HF radar indicated northward surface currents along the central California coast in fall and winter 2015-16. Northward advection appeared to be much stronger during the 1997-98 El Nino. Throughout 2015-16, the zooplankton community on the Oregon shelf was dominated by lipid-poor tropical and sub-tropical copepods and gelatinous zooplankton, indicating poor feeding conditions for small fishes that are prey for juvenile salmon. The presence of rarely encountered species increased copepod species richness during 2015-16 to levels higher than the 1998 El Nino. We infer that the unusual copepod vagrants of 2015-16 originated from an offshore and southwesterly source; an important difference from the southerly origin of vagrants during the 1997-98 El Nino.The very warm conditions caused sardine spawning to shift from central California to Oregon. Mesopelagic fish assemblage off southern California exhibited higher abundances of species with southern affinities, and lower abundances of species with northern affinities. Forage fish (Pacific herring, northern anchovy, and Pacific sardine) were much less abundant in 2015-16 compared to previous years. In contrast, catches of salmon were close to average off northern California. Catches of young-of-the- year rockfishes were high off central California, but low off both northern and southern California. Seabirds at Southeast Farallon Island in 2015 exhibited reduced breeding populations, reduced breeding success, lower chick growth rates, and lower fledging weights. Common murres were negatively affected in central and northern California, but seabird responses were species-specific. It is clear from the results presented here that the warm anomaly effects on the ecosystem were complicated, regionally specific, and that we do not fully understand them yet.									52	0	0	0	37	0	52			0575-3317			WOS:000392962400001

Mangrove forests, which occur across a broad biogeographic range from warm temperate to tropical, provide a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses by investigating the responses of herbivores to nutrient enrichment in temperate versus tropical latitudes. Mangroves are complex intertidal ecosystems with spatial differences in structure and diversity along tidal gradients and are threatened globally by human activities including nutrient over-enrichment. In this study, we used long-term fertilization experiments at the Indian River Lagoon, FL; Twin Cays, Belize; and Bocas del Toro, Panama to determine how increased nutrients impact herbivore abundance and herbivory of Rhizophora mangle at the tree, forest, and regional scales. At these locations, which span approximately 2185 km and 18.4A(0) of latitude, we fertilized individual trees with one of three treatments (Control, +N, +P) in two zones (fringe, scrub) along transects perpendicular to the shoreline and measured their responses for 4 years. Herbivory was measured as folivory, loss of yield, and tissue mining. Although nutrient enrichment altered plant growth, leaf traits, and nutrient dynamics, these variables had little effect on folivory at any location. Our results did not support the prediction that herbivory and per capita consumption are greatest at the most tropical location. Instead, folivory was highest at the most temperate location and lowest at the intermediate location. Folivory was generally higher in the fringe than in the scrub zone, but the pattern varied by location, herbivore, and nutrient treatment. Folivory by a dominant herbivore, Aratus pisonii, decreased from the highest to the lowest latitude. Our data suggest that factors controlling population dynamics of A. pisonii cascade to the mangrove canopy, linking herbivory to crab densities.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000325424500004

The main aim of this study was to compare the general trophic patterns with respect to continental populations of Northern Grey Shrike (Lanius excubitor) and Southern Grey Shrike. The material analysed consisted in 440 pellets collected during the four seasons of the year in the period April 2003-March 2004. A total of 5,112 prey items were identified, 85.4% corresponding to beetles (mainly Curculionidae and Tenebrionidae) and the rest consisted of other arthropods and vertebrates. Biomass mainly constituted of vertebrates, especially lizards (64.0%). Slight seasonal variations in diet were recorded, beetles and lizards being highly consumed in all seasons. A positive selection of some beetles, non-Formicidae Hymenoptera and Orthoptera (Schistocerca gregaria) was observed. The data obtained in the present study confirms the hypothesis of how the Southern Grey Shrike relies on cold-blooded prey in hot climate (e.g. south of France), while the Great Grey Shrike mainly relies on warm-blooded prey in cold climate (e.g. Scandinavian Peninsula). The importance of lizards in the diet of this insular shrike population could be related to three different ecological factors: (1) the high abundance of these ectotherm vertebrates in island environments, (2) the higher effectiveness of predation and (3) lower investment of energy to capture them.									17	0	0	0	14	0	21			0030-5685			WOS:000234595000004

The eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence dominate the physics of the Scotia Sea, leading to a strong advective flow, intense eddy activity and mixing. There is also strong seasonality, manifest by the changing irradiance and sea ice cover, which leads to shorter summers in the south. Summer phytoplankton blooms, which at times can cover an area of more than 0.5 million km(2), probably result from the mixing of micronutrients into surface waters through the flow of the ACC over the Scotia Arc. This production is consumed by a range of species including Antarctic krill, which are the major prey item of large seabird and marine mammal populations. The flow of the ACC is steered north by the Scotia Arc, pushing polar water to lower latitudes, carrying with it krill during spring and summer, which subsidize food webs around South Georgia and the northern Scotia Arc. There is also marked interannual variability in winter sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures that is linked to southern hemisphere-scale climate processes such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. This variation affects regional primary and secondary production and influences biogeochemical cycles. It also affects krill population dynamics and dispersal, which in turn impacts higher trophic level predator foraging, breeding performance and population dynamics. The ecosystem has also been highly perturbed as a result of harvesting over the last two centuries and significant ecological changes have also occurred in response to rapid regional warming during the second half of the twentieth century. This combination of historical perturbation and rapid regional change highlights that the Scotia Sea ecosystem is likely to show significant change over the next two to three decades, which may result in major ecological shifts.									218	4	0	0	162	0	224			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000243528200007	17405210

Boyle, and Chas Emes (2009) Trophodynamics in a shallow lagoon off northwestern Europe (Culbin Sands, Moray Firth): Spatial and temporal variability of epibenthic communities, their diets, and consumption efficiency, Zoological Studies 48(2): 196-214. Epibenthic communities and their diets, at Culbin Sands (a cold-temperate coastal lagoon in the Moray Firth, northeastern Scotland), were sampled every 2-4 wks for 3 yrs (1994-1996). These communities were more abundant and diverse in warmer months, especially in less-exposed areas of the lagoon. The most common species were the brown shrimp Crangon crangon, the shore crab Carcinus maenas, and teleost fish (sandeel Ammodytes tobianus, sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and Spinachia spinachia, seascorpion Myoxocephalus scorpius, gobies Pomatoschistus microps and Pomatoschistus minutus, flounder Platichthys flesus, and plaice Pleuronectes platessa). Diets of these epibenthic predators included benthic infauna (especially polychaetes Eteone longa, Pygospio elegans, and Fabricia sabella; oligochaetes Tubificoides benedini; isopods Eurydice pulchra; and bivalves Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica), small epibenthic organisms (amphipods especially Bathyporeia pilosa and Gammarus sp., and juvenile crabs Carcinus maenas and shrimp Crangon crangon), and zooplankton (harpacticoids, ostracods mostly Cypris sp., calanoid copepods, mysids Praunus flexuosus, and fish eggs and larvae). Insect larvae (Chironomidae) were also common in the stomach contents of the epibenthic predators. In fact, prey items with higher indices of relative importance for the most abundant predators (brown shrimp, common gobies, and plaice) were insect larvae for shrimp, amphipods Bathyporeia pilosa for shrimp and gobies, harpacticoids for plaice and gobies, and bivalves (larvae and siphons of adult individuals) mostly for plaice. Brown shrimp, common goby, and plaice had daily consumption levels of 1%, 3%, and 2.5% of their own body wet weights, respectively. Energy flows of 150, 68, and 65 kJ m(-2) yr(-1) were estimated from benthic invertebrates to brown shrimp, common gobies, and plaice, equivalent to consumption efficiencies of 30%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, of the standing stock of benthic invertebrates and small epibenthic species such as amphipods. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.2/196.pdf									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			1021-5506	1810-522X		WOS:000264854800006

The mechanisms behind this expansion remain unclear due to our limited knowledge of the species' ecology. We modelled the functional relationship between the 2 main life-cycle stages of M. atlantica over a 5 yr period (2009-2013) in the Western English Channel. Our aims were to determine the key features of the species' population dynamics and the influence of local environmental conditions on its population development. Our results highlighted a strong coupling between the timing of specific environmental conditions and the development of the M. atlantica population, thereby explaining interannual differences in the phenology of its blooms. Population development commenced with the initiation of eudoxid production by the overwintering polygastric stages. This reproductive event was linked to the onset of a spring temperature threshold, suggesting a critical basal limit of 10 degrees C for eudoxid production. Interannual variability in the timing of this threshold modulated the degree of mismatch between the developing M. atlantica population and the availability of copepod prey. Unusually cold conditions in the spring of 2010 and 2013 limited the capacity for M. atlantica to initiate eudoxid production leading to poor trophic phasing and the production of single autumn cohorts. In contrast, warmer conditions during spring 2009, 2011, and 2012 facilitated earlier population development, optimal trophic phasing and the production of both summer and autumn cohorts. These findings represent an important addition to our understanding of the ecology of M. atlantica in the Northeast Atlantic.									8	0	0	0	9	1	9			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000361694000009

Transects were positioned so that the 3 water masses in the plume area - plume water, Gulf of Mexico shelf water and frontal water (a mixture of the former 2) - were sampled. The plume was represented by a shallow lens of water < 34% salinity and < 29-degrees-C resting atop warmer (> 29-degrees-C) and more saline (> 34%) Gulf of Mexico shelf water. Strong turbidity fronts with a scale of 50 to 100 m form, relax and reform approximately at tidal frequencies within the frontal region that has a larger scale of 6 to 8 km. Total ichthyoplankton catch per tow, individual surface chlorophyll a values and macrozooplankton displacement volumes were all significantly greater in frontal waters than adjacent Gulf of Mexico shelf or plume waters. Hydrodynamic convergence at the continually forming and relaxing turbidity fronts most likely accounts for concentrated neustonic ichthyoplankton, and at least partially for high macrozooplankton values as well, in frontal waters. Elevated macrozooplankton displacement volumes in frontal waters may also result from higher rates of proliferation of macrozooplankton biomass. High primary production in frontal water is probably due to the mixing of nutrient-rich, but turbid, plume water (where photosynthesis is light limited) with clear, but nutrient-poor, Gulf of Mexico shelf water (where photosynthesis is nutrient limited) creating favorable phytoplankton growth conditions. Concentrations of ichthyoplankton and zooplankton offer rich trophic resources that some species utilize to gain superior growth. Faster growth will lead to increased survival and recruitment (because larvae pass through the period of greatest vulnerability to predation by gape-limited predators more quickly) if larval growth is increased disproportionately to larval mortality from predation.									122	1	0	0	91	4	124			0171-8630			WOS:A1991GG43500001

The zooplankton of the hypertrophic Laguna ChascomA(0)s (Argentina) is generally dominated by rotifers and cyclopoids copepods. An unusual dominance by small-cladocerans was observed after a massive winter fish kill in 2007. We hypothesized that small-cladocerans would increase the grazing pressure on heterotrophic flagellates (HF), reducing the degree of coupling between HF and picoplankton. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial food web structure under two contrasting zooplankton assemblages. The lake was sampled every other week between 2007 and 2009. The abundances of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and picocyanobacteria (Pcy) laid among the highest values reported for aquatic systems (> 10(8) and 10(7) cells ml(-1), respectively). Pcy averaged 53% of total picoplanktonic biomass. When small-cladocerans dominated zooplankton HF reached the higher abundance (> 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and picoplankton showed the opposite pattern, while the proportion of grazing resistant morphologies (i.e. microaggregates of Pcy) was higher. In contrast, when rotifers dominated, HF abundance decreased and picoplankton increased. Our data suggest that the degree of HF-HB coupling was affected by changes in zooplankton dominance. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, the present results suggest that large numbers of rotifers (> 5,000 ind. l(-1)) are more efficient than small-cladocerans at controlling HF populations.									31	2	0	0	30	1	34			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000320843100011		
J	Hempel, Mattias; Neukamm, Ruediger; Thiel, Ralf								Effects of introduced round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on diet composition and growth of zander (Sander lucioperca), a main predator in European brackish waters								AQUATIC INVASIONS				11	2			167	178		10.3391/ai.2016.11.2.06				JUN 2016	2016	We inspected diet and growth of zander Sander lucioperca, a main predator in North European brackish waters, from the Kiel Canal, northern Germany, to analyse effects of the introduced round goby Neogobius melanostomus as possible prey. Round goby represented the most important fish prey taxon in the zander diet in 2011-2013 with 21.8% of relative importance index (RI) over all inspected specimens. In particular zander of total length >= 200 mm fed heavily on round goby, at least in the warmer quarters (2nd and 3rd) of the years under study. RI for these quarters was ranging from 10.4% to 52.1% for predator specimens of 200-399 mm and from 45.6% to 79.7% of RI for specimens of = 400 mm. In the colder quarters of the inspected years (1st and 4th), zander >= 400 mm showed a high amount of cannibalism, with RI of young-of-the-year zander as prey ranging from 23.9% to 38.9%. The asymptotic total length (L-infinity) of the zander, calculated by the von Bertalanffy growth equation, was 937 mm. In comparison with data from 1995/1996, before the round goby invasion in 2006, zander from our study showed considerable differences in diet composition. RI of the prey organisms herring and Pomatoschistus spp. decreased from 26% to 13.4% and 14.2% to 4.4%, respectively. RI of young-of-the-year zander as prey for larger zander increased from 1.2% to 7.7% and round goby occurred as newly established prey taxon. Zander also showed faster growth and a better condition factor. We assume that this development has the potential to enhance the situation of the local fisheries that are strongly related to the catch of zander. In addition, abundance control of round goby seems to result from the high predator abundance.									20	0	0	0	18	0	20			1798-6540	1818-5487		WOS:000377691100006

In this shallow warm-temperate estuary; a significant macroalgal proliferation has been observed, which is a clear sign of nutrient enrichment. As a result of competition with algae, the extension of the seagrass meadows (mainly Zostera noltii) has been reduced. The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) in predicting the tendencies of trophic key-components (macrophytes, macroalgae, benthic macroinvertebrate and wading birds) as a response to the changes in estuarine environmental conditions. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. The data used in the dynamic model construction included true gradients of environmental changes and was sampled from January 1993 to September 1995 and from December 1998 to December 2005. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected ecological components. The model validation was based on independent data collected from January 1996 to January 1997 and from February 1999 to April 2000 for all the state variables considered. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the StDM reliability in capturing the trophic dynamics of the studied estuary, by predicting the behavioural pattern for the most part of the components selected, with a focus on the Zostera noltii meadows recovery after the implementation of important management measures.

Agassiz) has invaded the Black, Azov, Marmara and Aegean Seas, and, recently, the Caspian Sea. Here, we compare its spatial and temporal distribution, seasonal dynamics and the time and duration of reproduction. We also discuss factors that control its abundance throughout its invasive range and its effect on ecosystems. Observations are based on the long-term field data collected by three research institutes. An analysis of the effects of temperature, salinity, prey (zoo- and ichthyoplankton) availability and predation (by ctenophores of the genus Beroe) on M. leidyi population size, and the effects of M. leidyi on zoo- and ichthyoplankton, and on fish populations in the Black and Azov Seas is also provided. With the Black Sea current, M. leidyi spreads to the upper layers of the Sea of Marmara, where it now occurs around the year. At regular intervals, the Black Sea current also takes it to the northern Aegean Sea. In contrast, it has to re-invade the Sea of Azov every spring or summer, dying out during winter when the temperature drops below 4 degreesC. The warm summer and mild winter temperatures, relatively low salinity and abundance of prey in the Black Sea are close to optimal for M. leidyi, while they are suboptimal in the northern Aegean Sea, where salinity and temperature are often too high. In the Black Sea the absence of gelatinous and other predators led to an enormous ctenophore abundance for a decade, but with the appearance of Beroe ovata in 1999, M. leidyi abundance greatly decreased. Analysis of seasonal dynamics of M. leidyi in the Black Sea and in other seas of the Mediterranean basin indicates similarities in the timing of maximum abundance and biomass, in spite of some differences in the initiation and duration of reproduction. A peak biomass and density occurred in 1989 in the Black and Azov Seas and in 1990 in the other seas. The M. leidyi invasion negatively affected the ecosystems of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and zooplanktivorous fish stocks all underwent profound changes. Similar effects, but less pronounced, were recorded in the Sea of Marmara. Effects on Mediterranean food chains have, so far, remained insignificant. Salinity is probably supraoptimal here, and several predators prevent M. leidyi from reaching outbreak levels.									146	1	2	0	133	2	161			0025-3162			WOS:000171293800004		
J	Nyffeler, Martin; Altig, Ronald								Spiders as frog-eaters: a global perspective								JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY				48	1			26	42		10.1636/0161-8202-48.1.26				JUN 2020	2020	In this paper, 374 incidents of frog predation by spiders are reported based on a comprehensive global literature and social media survey. Frog-catching spiders have been documented from all continents except for Antarctica (.80% of the incidents occurring in the warmer areas between latitude 308 N and 308 S). Frog predation by spiders has been most frequently documented in the Neotropics, with particular concentration in the Central American and Amazon rain forests and the Brazilian Atlantic forest. The captured frogs are predominantly small-sized with an average body length of 2.76 6 0.13 cm (usually approximate to 0.2-3.8 g body mass). All stages of the frogs' life cycle (eggs/embryos, hatchlings, tadpoles, emerging metamorphs, immature post-metamorphs, adults) are vulnerable to spider predation. The majority (85%) of the 374 reported incidents of frog predation were attributable to web-less hunting spiders (in particular from the superfamilies Ctenoidea and Lycosoidea) which kill frogs by injection of powerful neurotoxins. The frog-catching spiders are predominantly nocturnal with an average body length of 2.24 +/- 0.12 cm (usually approximate to 0.1-2.7 g body mass). Altogether.200 frog species from 32 families (including several species of bitter tasting dart-poison frogs) have been documented to be hunted by >100 spider species from 22 families. Our finding that such a high diversity of spider taxa is utilizing such a high variety of frog taxa as prey is novel. The utilization of frogs as supplementary food increases the spiders' food supply (i.e., large diet breadth), and this is presumed to enhance their chance of survival. Studies from Australia and South America indicate that frogs might be a substantial component in the diet of some mygalomorph spiders (i.e., families Atracidae, Idiopidae, and Theraphosidae). Many more quantitative investigations on the natural diets of tropical spiders are needed before reliable conclusions on the importance of frogs as spider food can be drawn.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0161-8202	1937-2396		WOS:000543785600002

Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				100	10			1301	1314		10.1007/s10641-017-0643-9				OCT 2017	2017	Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014-15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin's niche breadth, and Manly's index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000412840700011		
J	Ferris, Rebecca; Wilson, Robbie S.					Wilson, Robbie/0000-0002-0116-5427			The physiological arms race: Exploring thermal acclimation among interacting species								JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY				37	3	SI		236	242		10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.01.006				APR 2012	2012	Thermal acclimation is often expected to increase performance during survival-related interactions, such as prey-capture and predator escape. However, few studies have examined acclimation responses in the context of the organism's ecology: namely, considering interactions among different species. In this study, we investigated the acclimation responses of three species of aquatic organisms from the same environment that simultaneously interact across different seasons. We predicted that the crimson spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi) and the freshwater shrimp (Paratya australiensis), which are involved in a predator-prey relationship, would exhibit similar thermal acclimation responses due to an arms race in physiological responses. In contrast, we expected that the backswimmer (Enithares sp.) species from the same environment, which is not commonly preyed upon due to their hard chitinous exterior, would display a limited acclimation response. We found that acute increases in temperature resulted in improved locomotor performance for all three species and an improved prey capture performance for M. duboulayi. Acclimation to 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C for 6 weeks did not affect the prey-capture performance of M. duboulayi or the locomotor performance of either M. duboulayi or Enithares sp. However, acclimation to cool temperatures improved the locomotor performance of P. australiensis at both cool and warm temperatures. Thus, the interaction between M. duboulayi (predator) and P. australiensis (prey) is likely to change across seasons via differences in acclimation responses, which could directly affect their behavioural strategies and population dynamics.

J	Zilio, Felipe								Diet of Falco sparverius Linnaeus 1758 (Aves: Falconidae) and Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782) (Aves: Strigidae) in a dune region on north coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil								REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA				14	4			379	392						DEC 2006	2006	Diet of Falco sparverius Linnaeus 1758 (Aves: Falconidae) and Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782) (Aves: Strigidae) in a dune region on north coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Falco sparverius (American Kestrel) and Athene cunicularia (Burrowing Owl) are two, usually sympatric, raptors found in Rio Grande do Sul. Both inhabit open habitats from Alaska and Canada to Tierra del Fuego. Both have similar diets, being generalists that feed on a wide range of prey that includes more invertebrates than vertebrates. The goal of this study is to compare the trophic characteristics of kestrels and owls in the north coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The study area includes grasslands, sand dunes and urban areas. From March/2000 to January/2002, 329 kestrel and 577 owl pellets were collected. Prey remains and capture attempts were also recorded. Diet composition of both species was similar. Invertebrates account for 98.5% of the diet for F. sparverius and 95.1% for A. cunicularia. Orthoptera (50.6%), Araneae (17.1%) and Coleoptera (10.5%) were the main prey eaten by F. sparverius, while Orthoptera (49.8%), Coleoptera (22.4%) and Hymenoptera (11.5%) were the main ones for A. cunicularia,. Among vertebrates, A. cunicularia took mainly Anura (3%) and Reptillia (0.9%), while F. sparverius fed on Aves (0.9%) and Anura (0.8%). Invertebrates were found in 100% of pellets of both raptors, while vertebrates were found only in 31.9% of the kestrel and 76% of the owl pellets. The spring diet of kestrels was distinct from other seasons, while summer and winter owl diets were the most distinct. The seasonality suggested by correspondence analysis is supported by the frequencies of the main prey taken along the year. Both raptors took Coleoptera in warm seasons (summer and spring) rather than cold seasons, whereas the opposite is true for Orthoptera. Hymenoptera and Araneae are common in owl pellets during the winter and spring, while kestrels took more spiders during the summer, and Hymenoptera in spring. Trophic niche overlap was high (67%), varying among seasons.									10	0	0	0	15	4	15			0103-5657			WOS:000208352700006

Série Zoologia				94	1			57	61		10.1590/S0073-47212004000100010				2004-03	2004	The diet of Leptodactylus ocellatus (L., 1758) was studied in specimens collected at Maldonado Department (Uruguay), where monthly surveys were made between August 1998 and March 2000. A total of 143 frogs were collected, measured, sexed, and dissected, to assess stomach contents. The anurans were grouped into three age classes and four categories (considering sex and capture date). The trophic amplitude for each age class and sex-season category was quantified using Shannon-Weaver Index, and the trophic niche overlap between ages and categories by using the Pianka Index. Comparisons among treatments were made by G-tests. The most important prey items were coleopterans (IRI = 2547), and significant correlations were found between predator and prey sizes. The major differences on diet composition were found between extreme age classes (froglets and adults). Significant differences were also detected between sexes in the cold season but not in the warm season. Any of these changes in diet may be related with the availability of prey.									46	0	1	0	51	13	61			1678-4766			SCIELO:S0073-47212004000100010

This lizard is linearly distributed along water courses, where it carries on most activities in well-lit, warm microhabitats. Activity does not occur on days with cloud cover. Late morning and midday activity predominates on sunny days. Body temperatures of active lizards were 35.9 +/- 0.37 degreesC (mean +/- SE) and were higher than substrate or air temperatures at the point of capture and higher than overall temperatures in the habitat. Although a variety of prey types are eaten, spiders, grasshoppers and crickets, roaches, and insect larvae dominate the diet. Larger lizards eat larger prey but also include small prey in their diets. Absolute and relative prey sizes were greater for lizards at the Rio Ituxi than for those in Rondonia, but lizard stomachs were equally full, suggesting that prey types available varied between sites. Males reach larger body sizes than females and have relatively larger heads. Although K. altamazonica is similar in ecology to other Amazonian Kentropyx species, it is more closely associated with water than the others.									14	0	0	0	14	2	16			0008-4301			WOS:000172265900013

We investigated the relationships between diet composition and feeding success in 1797 polar cod larvae and juveniles 4.5-55.6 mm standard length (SL) collected in five Arctic seas from 1993 to 2009. Prey were identified to species and developmental stages when possible, measured, and their carbon content was estimated using taxon-specific allometric equations. Feeding success was defined as the ratio of ingested carbon to fish weight. Carbon uptake in polar cod larvae < 15 mm was sourced primarily from calanoid copepods eggs and nauplii which were positively selected from the plankton. With increasing length, carbon sources shifted from eggs and nauplii to the copepodites ofCalanus glacialis,Calanus hyperboreusandPseudocalanusspp.Calanus glacialiscopepodites were the main carbon source in polar cod > 25 mm and the only copepodite positively selected for.Pseudocalanusspp. copepodites became important replacement prey whenC. glacialisleft the epipelagic layer at the end of summer.Calanus glacialiswas the preferred prey of polar cod, contributing from 23 to 84% of carbon uptake at any stage in the early development. Feeding success was determined by the number of prey captured in larvae < 15 mm and by the size of prey in juveniles > 30 mm. As Arctic seas warm, the progressive displacement ofC. glacialisby the smallerCalanus finmarchicuscould accelerate the replacement of polar cod, the dominant Arctic forage fish, by boreal species.

However, it is not yet possible to establish the extent to which non-rice plants and animal components contribute to its diet. To contribute to these issues, we studied the diet of the Bobolink found in rice fields on its wintering grounds in Santa Fe, Argentina, to provide information on (i) the composition of the diet and (ii) the relative importance of plant and animal components in the diet and of the different prey categories. We captured Bobolinks with mist nets and obtained samples of stomach contents by warm water and emetic-based regurgitation to determine the composition of the diet (n = 46 samples) and the importance of the different prey (n = 25 samples), mainly during March, just prior to northbound migration. We confirmed that the Bobolink's diet in this region during this period is predominantly herbivorous (97%) and rice-based (55%), although it also consumes a large number of seeds of non-cultivated plants that represented 42% of the diet. Invertebrates, although of less importance than plant components (3%), had been consumed by 97% of captured individuals. Our results document the importance of non-cultivated plants and animal prey in the diet of Bobolinks in addition to rice.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-5657			WOS:000475382100002

However, their impact on the American lobster (Homarus americanus) is not well understood. During a two-year trap study (2013-2014) in The Great Bay Estuary, NH, we captured 1229 green crabs and 144 lobsters in 248 individual trap hauls (average catch per unit effort = 10.98 +/- 1.51 for green crabs and 0.49 +/- 0.08 for lobsters), or similar to 8.5 times more green crabs than lobsters. In general, green crabs were more abundant in areas furthest from the coast (up-estuary), which also tended to be warmer, while lobsters were more abundant in areas closer to the coast (down-estuary). Nevertheless, there was still considerable overlap between the two species. We evaluated the competitive interactions between green crabs and lobsters in the laboratory using a behavioral assay and found that in 31%" of the trials, large lobsters (>80 mm in carapace length) killed (and consumed) green crabs of varying sizes that failed to escape or move to safe areas of the enclosure. These results suggest that adult lobsters are not likely vulnerable to green crabs. While there may be reasons why lobsters did not select specific sizes of green crabs to prey on, some crabs may have an impact on juvenile lobsters. These data provide some insight into the distribution and abundance of green crabs and their impact on the lobster population in a large New England estuary that supports a commercial lobster fishery.

In this study we report the species richness and abundance of the saturniids captured in a fragment of tropical semi-deciduous forest in central Veracruz, Mexico. The moths were attracted using 250 W mercury vapor lamp 1 night per month from September 2014 to August 2015. Thirty-one species belonging to 18 genera, 2 tribes and 4 subfamilies were determined. The total number of species constitutes 6.87% and 30.39% of the species known from Mexico and Veracruz, respectively. Coverage-based rarefaction and an extrapolation curve showed high diversity compared with previous studies in Mexico. Antheraea polyphemus mexicana, Automeris montezuma, Citheronia lobesi jordani, Hylesia coinopus, Molippa ninfa, and Pseudodirphia mexicana are endemic from Mexico. The highest richness and abundance of species were observed in May with 77% of the species collected during this month. These variables are thought to extend periods of flight activity for copulations. This study provides a survey of Saturniidae family species richness and abundance in one of the most diverse, but disturbed ecosystems of Veracruz.

Sympterygia acuta displays a clear seasonal reproductive cycle, characterized by maximum egg-laying activity in spring and hatching in summer. We hypothesized that diet and feeding activity change with maturity stage and season and that, given its smallish size, the trophic level is low. Using a multiple-hypothesis modeling approach, the diet of S.acuta in relation to sex, body size, maturity stage, region (i.e. north and south) and season was analysed; and a potential relationship between feeding activity and the seasonal reproductive cycle was assessed. Sympterygia acuta fed on a broad spectrum of prey, but teleosts were more important (47.97% index of relative importance, %IRI), followed by decapods (39.84%IRI), cumaceans (8.31%IRI) and isopods (1.89%IRI). Maturity stage was a strong determinant of the ontogenetic diet shift of S.acuta, and relationships between number of prey consumed with season and region were found.. Feeding activity was higher in the cold season than in the warm season, and was less important in the south region than in the north region. Unexpectedly, the specific trophic level was high (3.87). Sympterygia acuta shifts its diet with maturity stage, possibly by a combination of an improved ability to capture prey and a change in energy demand of mature individuals. Despite being a small-to-medium-sized skate, S.acuta showed a trophic level similar to that of large-bodied marine predators. It reduces its feeding activity seasonally because in the warm season this species may experience an increased predation risk from large sharks.									7	0	0	0	6	1	7			0173-9565	1439-0485		WOS:000374977500004		
J	Nyffeler, Martin; Pusey, Bradley J.								Fish Predation by Semi-Aquatic Spiders: A Global Pattern								PLOS ONE				9	6					e99459	10.1371/journal.pone.0099459				JUN 18 2014	2014	More than 80 incidences of fish predation by semi-aquatic spiders - observed at the fringes of shallow freshwater streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps, and fens - are reviewed. We provide evidence that fish predation by semi-aquatic spiders is geographically widespread, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. Fish predation by spiders appears to be more common in warmer areas between 40 degrees S and 40 degrees N. The fish captured by spiders, usually ranging from 2-6 cm in length, are among the most common fish taxa occurring in their respective geographic area (e. g., mosquitofish [Gambusia spp.] in the southeastern USA, fish of the order Characiformes in the Neotropics, killifish [Aphyosemion spp.] in Central and West Africa, as well as Australian native fish of the genera Galaxias, Melanotaenia, and Pseudomugil). Naturally occurring fish predation has been witnessed in more than a dozen spider species from the superfamily Lycosoidea (families Pisauridae, Trechaleidae, and Lycosidae), in two species of the superfamily Ctenoidea (family Ctenidae), and in one species of the superfamily Corinnoidea (family Liocranidae). The majority of reports on fish predation by spiders referred to pisaurid spiders of the genera Dolomedes and Nilus (>75% of observed incidences). There is laboratory evidence that spiders from several more families (e. g., the water spider Argyroneta aquatica [Cybaeidae], the intertidal spider Desis marina [Desidae], and the 'swimming' huntsman spider Heteropoda natans [Sparassidae]) predate fish as well. Our finding of such a large diversity of spider families being engaged in fish predation is novel. Semi-aquatic spiders captured fish whose body length exceeded the spiders' body length (the captured fish being, on average, 2.2 times as long as the spiders). Evidence suggests that fish prey might be an occasional prey item of substantial nutritional importance.									32	1	0	0	33	0	35			1932-6203			WOS:000338508200025	24940885

It has been suggested that this decline could be related to poor nutritional condition of the post-larvae, especially lipid which is accumulated in large quantities during the preceding extensive pelagic larval stage. The current study focused on investigations into the lipid content and fatty acid (FA) profiles of lobster phyllosoma larvae from three mid to late stages of larval development (stages VI, VII, VIII) sampled from two cyclonic and two anticyclonic eddies of the Leeuwin Current off Western Australia. The results showed significant accumulation of lipid and energy storage FAs with larval development regardless of location of capture, however, larvae from cyclonic eddies had more lipid and FAs associated with energy storage than larvae from anticyclonic eddies. FA food chain markers from the larvae indicated significant differences in the food webs operating in the two types of eddy, with a higher level of FA markers for production from flagellates and a lower level from copepod grazing in cyclonic versus anticyclonic eddies. The results indicate that the microbial food web operating in cyclonic eddies provides better feeding conditions for lobster larvae despite anticyclonic eddies being generally more productive and containing greater abundances of zooplankton as potential prey for lobster larvae. Gelatinous zooplankton, such as siphonophores, may play an important role in cyclonic eddies by accumulating dispersed microbial nutrients and making them available as larger prey for phyllosoma. The markedly superior nutritional condition of lobster larvae feeding in the microbial food web found in cyclonic eddies, could greatly influence their subsequent settlement and recruitment to the coastal fishery.

J	Nyffeler, Martin; Knoernschild, Mirjam				Knornschild, Mirjam/C-9401-2011				Bat Predation by Spiders								PLOS ONE				8	3					e58120	10.1371/journal.pone.0058120				MAR 13 2013	2013	In this paper more than 50 incidences of bats being captured by spiders are reviewed. Bat-catching spiders have been reported from virtually every continent with the exception of Antarctica (similar to 90% of the incidences occurring in the warmer areas of the globe between latitude 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S). Most reports refer to the Neotropics (42% of observed incidences), Asia (28.8%), and Australia-Papua New Guinea (13.5%). Bat-catching spiders belong to the mygalomorph family Theraphosidae and the araneomorph families Nephilidae, Araneidae, and Sparassidae. In addition to this, an attack attempt by a large araneomorph hunting spider of the family Pisauridae on an immature bat was witnessed. Eighty-eight percent of the reported incidences of bat catches were attributable to web-building spiders and 12% to hunting spiders. Large tropical orb-weavers of the genera Nephila and Eriophora in particular have been observed catching bats in their huge, strong orb-webs (of up to 1.5 m diameter). The majority of identifiable captured bats were small aerial insectivorous bats, belonging to the families Vespertilionidae (64%) and Emballonuridae (22%) and usually being among the most common bat species in their respective geographic area. While in some instances bats entangled in spider webs may have died of exhaustion, starvation, dehydration, and/or hyperthermia (i.e., non-predation death), there were numerous other instances where spiders were seen actively attacking, killing, and eating the captured bats (i.e., predation). This evidence suggests that spider predation on flying vertebrates is more widespread than previously assumed.									41	1	0	0	42	1	47			1932-6203			WOS:000316849200033	23516436

However, traditional fallow field borders lack nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect communities, and their value to small mammals is not well-understood. In October-November 2009, we trapped small mammals in four field-border treatments (planted native, warm-season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, and frequently mowed vegetation) replicated around nine organic crop fields, and developed closed-population models in Program MARK to estimate abundance in each border. We also measured vegetation cover within each border treatment from June to August 2009. We captured 491 individuals of two species, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and house mouse (Mus musculus). Cotton rat abundance was >= 2 times greater in grass and flower borders and flowers-only borders than in fallow borders, likely because of greater vegetation density and availability of preferred foods in planted borders. No cotton rats were captured in mowed borders, and house mouse abundance was >= 5 times lower in mowed borders than in other border types. Lower abundance of cotton rats and house mice in mowed borders emphasizes the importance of structurally complex non-crop vegetation for supporting small-mammal communities in agricultural landscapes. Field borders planted to promote beneficial insects may be a useful tool for maximizing the ecological services provided by non-crop vegetation.

J	Rodrigo, Eugenia; Catala-Oltra, Marta; Perez-Laorga, Eduardo; Baena, Manuel								Monitoring of Matsucoccus feytaudi (Hemiptera: Matsucoccidae) and its natural enemies in Spain using sticky tapes and pheromone traps								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY				110	2			301	310		10.14411/eje.2013.043				2013	2013	The maritime pine bast scale, Matsucoccus feytaudi Ducasse (Hemiptera: Matsucoccidae), occurs in the western part of the Mediterranean basin and is a sap sucking insect that feeds only on maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton). It causes damage in SE France and Italy, where it was accidentally introduced. In Spain information is scarce and, moreover, almost nothing is known about the predators of this species. This study was designed to determine the seasonal trends in abundance of M. feytaudi and its major predators, which might help to improve the biological control of this pest in other areas. Natural P. pinaster stands in the Valencian Community (Spain) were surveyed in 2004. In addition, the seasonal trends in abundance of M. feytaudi and its natural enemies were monitored in three stands over a period of three years (2002, 2005 and 2006). The monitoring was carried by wrapping sticky tapes around tree trunks and using delta traps baited with sexual pheromone. The maritime pine bast scale was detected in all the stands surveyed. At almost all the sites surveyed, three species of predators were captured: Elatophilus nigricornis Zetterstedt (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Hemerobius stigma Stephens (Neuroptera: Hemerobiidae) and Malachiomimus pectinatus (Kiesenwetter) (Coleoptera: Malachiidae). The presence of M. pectinatus is noteworthy as this is the first record of this species as a possible predator of M. feytaudi. The results show that M. feytaudi, although differing in its phenology depending on the location, is univoltine in the study area. The prepupae, pupae and adults of M. feytaudi appeared between December and March in colder areas and between October and February in warmer areas. E. nigricornis nymphs are important predators of M. feytaudi, and were abundant when the scale insect (crawlers, prepupae, pupae, male and female adults) was present. The flight period of E. nigricornis and the hemerobiid H. stigma ranged from May to October. However, these flight patterns did not correlate with the presence of the different stages of the bast scale (crawlers, prepupae, pupae, male and female adults) on the surface of tree trunks. The presence of M. pectinatus in large numbers in some stands suggests it might be an important natural regulator, which helps to keep M. feytaudi populations at low densities in the areas of Spain studied. This malachiid shows a strong kairomonal attraction to the sexual pheromone of M. feytaudi and its flight activity is significantly correlated with the presence of crawlers of bast scale.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3				1802-8829		WOS:000318038400016

This study documents the nesting and foraging ecology of a large (similar to 13 mm total length) arboreal trap-jaw ant, Odontomachus hastatus (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in a sandy plain forest on Cardoso Island, off the coast of Southeast Brazil. The results showed that O. hastatus nested in root clusters of epiphytic bromeliads, most commonly Vriesea procera (70% of nest plants). Mature O. hastatus colonies include one to several queens and about 500 workers. Foraging by O. hastatus is primarily nocturnal year-round, with increased foraging activity during the wet/warm season. The foragers hunt singly in the trees, preying on a variety of canopy-dwelling arthropods, with flies, moths, ants, and spiders accounting for > 60% of the prey captured. Although predators often have impacts on prey populations, the ecological importance of O. hastatus remains to be studied.									21	0	0	0	19	0	21				1536-2442		WOS:000302754900001	22957686

Ant colonies exhibited nocturnal activity throughout the year, and they foraged significantly more intensively in the wet/warm (November-March) than in the cold/dry season (April-October). As the night begins, small groups of workers disperse and hunt individually on a wide diversity of litter arthropods of variable sizes. At dusk, encounters with foragers of the diurnal ponerine Pachycondyla striata Fr. Smith were conspicuously avoided by O.chelifer, which occasionally had their prey robbed by the former or were even taken as prey themselves. Termites were the preferred prey of O. chelifer, making up 40% of the food items captured in each season. Seasonal comparisons of prey organisms captured by O. chelifer, and of litter-dwelling arthropods sampled in pitfall traps, revealed that the frequency distribution Of retrieved prey in each taxonomic group did not differ seasonally, despite the 2.7-fold increase in the overall availability of litter arthropods in the warm/wet period. This result supports foraging theory by showing that preference for certain animal prey types (i.e., taxonomic groups) persists through time despite seasonal fluctuations in the overall availability of potential prey oil the forest floor. This study points out to the importance of studying ant foraging ecology and diet preferences in a natural context.									27	1	0	0	28	2	29			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000271533300025

Elliott, Kyle/S-9185-2019				Seabird foraging behaviour indicates prey type								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				354				289	303		10.3354/meps07221				2008	2008	To investigate how a generalist marine predator modifies its foraging behaviour by prey type, we attached time-depth-temperature recorders to chick-rearing thick-billed murres (n = 204) at Coats Island, Nunavut, Canada from 1999 to 2007. Predators varied their behavior along 3 major 'axes': foraging effort, prey depth and prey lifestyle (benthic/pelagic). Dive behaviours for different prey-fish doctor, squid, sandlance, amphipods, snakeblenny, daubed shanny, sandlance and Arctic shanny-were discriminated from one another in a discriminant analysis of dive variables and these prey were therefore considered 'specialist' prey items. Specifically, amphipods were captured during V-shaped dives near the colony with a slow bird descent rate, squid were captured during deep V-shaped dives in cold water and fish doctor were captured during a long series of U-shaped dives in relatively warm water far from the colony. Arctic shanny and snakeblenny tended to be taken at moderate distances from the colony, with snakeblenny taken at deeper depths. Daubed shanny captures showed a bimodal distribution, with some taken at shallow depths far from the colony and others at deep depths close to the colony. Dive behaviours for Arctic cod, capelin and sculpin overlapped both with each other and the behaviours for specialist prey items and, therefore, were classified as 'generalist' prey items. In general, V-shaped dives preceded deliveries of pelagic prey items and U-shaped dives preceded deliveries of benthic prey items. Our results strongly suggest that generalist marine predators use stereotypic behaviour to forage for prey items, based on previous knowledge about what locations/strategies maximized intake for a given prey type.									92	1	0	0	87	0	94			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000253609500028

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				50	10			1706	1717		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01432.x				OCT 2005	2005	1. In view of the paucity of data on the response of warm shallow lakes to reductions in nutrient loading, this paper presents a long-term limnological data set to document changes in the food-web of a shallow Mediterranean lake (Lake Albufera, Valencia, Spain) that has experienced reductions in phosphorus (P) (77%) and nitrogen (N) (24%) loading following sewage diversion.2. Nine years after sewage diversion, P concentration in the lake was reduced by 30% but remained high (TP = 0.34 mg L-1), although the mean water retention time in the lake was only 0.1 years. Nitrate concentrations did not significantly change, probably because the lake continued to receive untreated effluents from ricefields.3. Chlorophyll a concentration was reduced by half (annual mean of 180 mu g L-1). Cyanobacteria abundance remained high but its composition changed towards smaller species, both filamentous and chroococcal forms.4. Cladocera abundance increased and reached peaks twice a year (December to March and July to September). After nutrient reduction, short-term clear-water phases (up to 5 weeks) occurred during February to March in several years, concomitant with annual flushing of the lake and lower fish densities. The abundance of Cladocera in winter contrasted with the spring peaks observed in northern restored shallow lakes. The zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio remained lower than in northern temperate shallow lakes, probably because of fish predation on zooplankton.5. Improvement of the water quality of Lake Albufera remained insufficient to counteract littoral reed regression or improve underwater light allowing submerged plants re-colonise the lake.6. Sewage diversion from Lake Albufera impacted the food web through the plankton, but higher trophic levels, such as fish and waterfowl, were affected to a lesser degree. Although the fish species present in the lake are mainly omnivorous, long-term data on commercial fish captures indicated that fish communities changed in response to nutrient level and trophic structure as has been observed in restored shallow lakes at northern latitudes.7. Phosphorus concentrations produced similar phytoplankton biomass in Lake Albufera as in more northern shallow lakes with abundant planktivorous fish and small zooplankton. However, in Lake Albufera, high average concentrations were maintained throughout the year. Overall, results suggest that nutrient control may be a greater priority in eutrophicated warm shallow lakes than in similar lakes at higher latitudes.

This bay is a shallow water, high productivity coastal area where shrimps and small fish are abundant throughout the warmer months. Young of M. schmitti are found in the bay from late spring to mid autumn, The analysis of stomach contents showed that the young feed mainly on crustaceans, the shrimp Artemesia longinaris being the main prey item. The bay serves as a nursery, area for M. schmitti, and the length range and umbilical scars present in all the specimens studied revealed that the individuals were newborns. At Bahia Engano., fishing trawls in the intertidal and surf zone are common, and similar to 80% of the total number of species caught is considered as by-catch. The newborns and juvenile M. schmitti are all important element of this by-catch. Since the reproductive potential of the smoothhound shark is low, the protection of these newborns and juveniles from fishing pressure is of great importance.									12	0	0	0	13	3	14			0025-3154			WOS:000172659800017		
J	Stapp, P								Microhabitat use and community structure of darkling beetles (Coleoptera:Tenebrionidae) in shortgrass prairie: Effects of season, shrub cover and soil type								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				137	2			298	311		10.2307/2426849				APR 1997	1997	I conducted pitfall-trapping studies from 1992 through 1995 to evaluate the effects of vegetation structure and soil texture on seasonal variation in the distribution, relative abundance and species composition of darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) in shrub-dominated areas of shortgrass prairie in N-central Colorado. Numbers of beetles captured in traps placed in shrub, cactus, grass and bare-ground microhabitats were used to assess microhabitat use and diel timing of activity, differences in the relative abundance of beetles between spring and summer and to compare beetle communities on sites with different shrub vegetation and soil types. Beetles were most numerous in summer on all sites, although some species showed peaks of activity in spring. All but two species (Eleodes extricata, E. hispilabris) were captured significantly more often in traps beneath shrubs, underscoring the importance of this microhabitat for thermal cover, food or protection from predators. Further, in shrub-dominated areas, beetles were more nocturnal than had been reported previously for adjacent grasslands, suggesting that shrubs kept temperatures on low-lying areas warmer at night than on open prairie. Fourteen tenebrionid species were captured, and on average, significantly more species were captured beneath shrubs than in other microhabitats. Each site had a suite of five resident species, of which only Eleodes obscura and Embaphion contusum were captured on all sites during all trapping periods. Species richness and beetle abundance, especially of the most common species (Eleodes obscura), were inversely related to shrub cover but were greater ill areas with coarsely textured soils. Overall, tenebrionid communities in shrub-dominated areas were similar to those reported for open prairie, but small species tend to predominate in grasslands, perhaps because most refuges are relatively small. The prevalence of larger beetles in areas with sandy soils and large shrubs may be related to the number of suitable refuges, both belowground and in vegetation, as well as the availability of preferred feeding and oviposition sites.									48	16	0	0	49	1	64			0003-0031			WOS:A1997WZ28900011

Fish acclimated to 5 degrees C remained interested in feeding following an acute rise in temperature to 15 degrees C over 12h. Prey capture was a stereotyped behaviour consisting of stalking and stationary phases, followed by an S-shaped fast-start (stage 1), a propulsive stroke (stage 2) and a glide of variable duration during which the mouth was expanded and protruded to suck in the prey (stage 3). The duration of the preparatory stroke (half tail-beat, stage 1) was significantly shorter at 15 degrees C (48.8 ms) than at 5 degrees C (108.3 ms) in the 5 degrees C-acclimated sculpin (Q(10)=2.2). For 5 degrees C-acclimated fish, at 5 degrees C, the maximum values for acceleration and velocity along the path travelled by the fish were 16.2 ms(-2) and 0.8 ms(-1) respectively. Both variables were relatively independent of acute temperature change (Q(10)=1.1-1.2; P>0.1). At 15 degrees C, the maximum velocity was 33 % higher and the tail-beat duration of the propulsive stroke was 37 % shorter in 15 degrees C-acclimated than in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish. Both stride length and tail-beat amplitude were significantly higher (28 and 23 % respectively) in 15 degrees C- compared with 5 degrees C-acclimated sculpin at 15 degrees C. The results demonstrate plasticity in the major kinematic variables of fast-starts following warm acclimation sufficient to increase the percentage of successful attacks during prey capture from 23.2 to 73.4 %.									82	6	0	0	82	1	89			0022-0949			WOS:A1995QD18400022		
J	MUONA, J; RUTANEN, I					Muona, Jyrki/0000-0003-2771-1171			THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF FIRE ON THE BEETLE FAUNA IN BOREAL CONIFEROUS FOREST								ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI				31	1			109	121						1994	1994	The immediate changes caused by forest fire in the beetle fauna were studied at three sites in boreal coniferous forest in Finland. In general the number of individuals and species increased after fire. The species attracted to the burnt forest included wood-borers (Cerambycidae, Curculionidae, Anobiidae, some Elateridae), species developing under bark of damaged trees, species associated with fungi (Lathrididae, Cryptophagidae, Nitidulidae, Leiodidae) and certain soil- and litter-dwelling groups: Carabidae, Byrrhidae and some Elateridae. Predators utilizing diptera larvae in mushrooms increased strongly after the fire as well. Many of the species presumed to be associated with wood-fungi peaked immediately after the fire, i.e. many cryptophagids, lathridids and nitidulids, whereas the leiodids Anisotoma spp. and Agathidium spp. became commoner two years after the fire. Several species previously known to strongly prefer burnt forests were captured. The fire specialists form a hetergenous ecological group, indicating that a substantial portion of the forest species have adapted to fire cycles. A large group of species normally found only in man-made, microclimatically warm habitats, e.g. compost, were attracted to two of the burnt sites. Their absence from the third site was probably due to lack of suitable source areas in the immediate surroundings.

J	SMITH, SL								GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EUPHAUSIIDS THYSANOESSA-RASCHI (M-SARS) AND THYSANOESSA-INERMIS (KROYER) IN THE SOUTHEASTERN BERING SEA								POLAR RESEARCH				10	2			461	478		10.1111/j.1751-8369.1991.tb00666.x				DEC 1991	1991	The distribution and abundance of the euphausiids Thysanoessa raschi and Thysanoessa inermis in the shelf waters of the southeastern Bering Sea were investigated during spring and summer of 1980 and 1981. Experiments were conducted during the study to describe thc reproduction, growth and development of these species. T. inermis was the dominant euphausiid species observed over thc outer shelf region; it began spawning in early April while T. raschi dominated the euphausiids over the middle shelf and began spawning in mid or late May. The seasonal progression in spawning followed the seasonal development of temperature; however, spawning did not begin earlier in 1981 which was a warmer year than 1980. Average egg production of T. raschi ranged from 3.4% to 3.8% dry body weight of the female per day during the first three days after capture. Secondary production estimates for T. raschi females ranged from 4.2% to 5.2% dry body weight per day in 1980 and 5.9% to 6.0% dry body weight per day in 1981. A sharp decline in the abundance of adolescent and adult euphausiids over the middle shelf during the spring bloom period when food appeared to be abundant suggests that predation by diving birds, pollack, Tanner crabs. whales and seals effectively controls the euphausiid population.

The deep pelagic shrimp Hymenopenaeus doris is a common decapod that thrives in low oxygen layers of the eastern Pacific Ocean. When first observed in situ using a remotely operated vehicle, most specimens of H. doris appeared dead due to inactivity and inverted orientation. Closer inspection revealed that these animals were utilizing small, subtle shifts in appendage position to control their orientation and sink rate. In this mode, they resembled molted shrimp exoskeletons. We hypothesize that these shrimp may avoid capture by visually-cued predators with this characteristic behavior. The low metabolic rates of H. doris (0.55-0.81 mg O-2 kg(-1) min(-1)) are similar to other deep-living shrimp, and also align with their high hypoxia tolerance and reduced activity. We observed similar behavior in another deep pelagic decapod, Petalidium suspiriosum, which transiently inhabited Monterey Canyon, California, during a period of anomalously warm ocean conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000451755800054	30485334

The composition and abundance of calcifying species in the prevailing oceanic plankton community plays a major role in driving the CCP. Here we assess the role of these calcifying organisms in regulating the strength of the CCP in a Southern Ocean region (northern Scotia Sea) known to be a major hotspot for the draw-down of atmospheric CO2. We show that, when shelled pteropods dominate the calcifying community, the total annual reduction of CO2 transferred to the deep ocean doubles (17%) compared to when other plankton calcifiers dominate (3-9%). Furthermore, predation enhances their contribution through the removal of organic soft tissue. Pteropods are threatened in polar regions by ocean warming and acidification. We determine that their potential decline would have major implications to the comparative strengths of the BCP and CCP.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2041-1723			WOS:000449069600014	30390024

Linking nutrition, physiology and behaviour is critical to predict the extent to which a species adjusts its nutritional niche breadth at the levels of prey (prey composition niche, defined as the range of prey compositions eaten) and diet (realized nutritional niche is the range of diets composed through feeding on the prey). Here, we studied adult chick-rearing Australasian gannets Morus serrator to propose an integrative approach using sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa), geographic location and bathymetry over different years, to explore their relationship with the nutritional composition of prey and diets (i.e. prey composition and nutritional niche breadth), habitat use and foraging behaviour. We found that gannets feed on prey that varied widely in their nutritional composition (have a broad prey composition niche), and composed diets from these prey that likewise varied in composition (have a broad realized nutritional niche), suggesting generalism at two levels of macronutrient selection. Across seasons, we established nutritional landscapes (hereafter nutriscapes), linking the nutritional content of prey (wet mass protein-to-lipid ratioP:L) to the most likely geographic area of capture and bathymetry. Nutriscapes varied in their P:L from 6.06 to 15.28, over time, space and bathymetry (0-150m). During warm water events (strong positive SSTa), gannets expanded their foraging habitat, increased their foraging trip duration and consumed prey and diets with low macronutrient content (wet mass proportions of P and L). They were also constrained to the smallest prey composition and realized nutritional niche breadths. Our findings are consistent with previous suggestions that dietary generalism evolves in heterogeneous environments, and provide a framework for understanding the nutritional goals in wild marine predators and how these goals drive ecological interactions and are, in turn, ultimately shaped by environmental fluctuations.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000441246100009	29873067	
J	Soledad Cota-Meza, Maria; Ana Fernandez-Alamo, Maria; Funes-Rodriguez, Rene								Abundance of Flaccisagitta enflata and analysis of Chaetognatha community in a circadian cycle in Bahia Magdalena lagoon system Baja California Sur, Mexico								HIDROBIOLOGICA				25	3			414	423						SEP-DEC 2015	2015	The chaetognath Flaccisagitta enflata abundance was determined in the Bahia Magdalena lagoon complex, Baja California Sur, Mexico. This study is based on two sampling methods, in the first one zooplankton was collected from a basic plan of 28 stations, for eight months in 1982, and the second, during 24-hour cycle, August 1-2 during 1988. The capture of organisms was made with a standard conical net of 0.3 m of mouth diameter, 1 m long, and 0.3 mm of mesh size. Analysis revealed that F. enflata average abundances were low from February to June, and significantly higher from July to December (p<0.05). The results of the 24-hour cycle, showed that the total abundance of chaetognaths and F. enflata follows the same trend with the tidal cycle. However, no significant differences day/night capture (p< 0.05) were observed between different species of chaetognaths, except for Parasagitta euneritica, Serratosagitta bierii and Mesosagitta minima. The presence of individuals of F. enflata 2.0 mm (new born) and adults near the mouth of access to the lagoon, were possibly transported from the adjacent oceanic area during the influx of warm waters from August to November.									1	0	0	0	1	1	1			0188-8897			WOS:000387069600011

Information about its feeding habits in the coastal region of Acapulco, Guerrero is extremely limited. In the present study we quantified the diet of sailfish, based on captures made from March 2008 to December 2009 by the sport fishing fleet of Acapulco. We analysed a total of 561 stomachs, of which 254 contained food (45%). The size interval of examined specimens was between 101 and 212 cm postorbital length and between 15 and 47 kg total weight. In general, teleosts were the most important prey, followed by cephalopods. According to index of relative importance, the most important species in the diet were the fish Auxis thazard (63.04%) and Fistularia commersonii (6.62%), followed by the cephalopod Octopus spp. (4.58%). There were no significant differences in the diet by sex (males and females), sexual maturity (immature and mature), or by season (warm and cold seasons). In all cases the most important prey species was A. thazard. We conclude that the sailfish I. platypterus off Acapulco behaves as a specialist predator because, despite the consumption of a high number of prey items, it feeds preferentially on a reduced number of prey species that form schools, and are available and abundant in the ocean.									4	0	0	0	4	1	4			0025-3154	1469-7769		WOS:000318625700028

We studied the diet of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on a diel basis in the Flint River, a warmwater stream in Michigan, U.S.A. Diet and available prey samples were collected seven times over a 24 h period in four consecutive months. The section of river studied lacked zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), the primary prey of adult round gobies elsewhere in the Great Lakes region.2. Diet changed on a diel basis with hydropsychid caddisfly and chironomid larvae predominating during the day, chironomid pupae dominating in the evening and heptageniid mayflies dominating at night. Simultaneous study of macroinvertebrate drift suggested that caddisfly and chironomid larvae were most likely picked from submerged rocks, chironomid pupae were most likely taken during their emergent ascent and mayflies were either captured from the drift or picked from rocks.3. The Flint River lacks a diverse darter (Family: Percidae) and sculpin (Family: Cottidae) fauna and it appears that the round goby has occupied a generalised darter/sculpin niche. Our results indicate that round gobies have the potential to invade successfully riverine systems, particularly those lacking a diverse benthic fish assemblage.									63	0	0	0	62	0	64			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000236022900012		
J	Stehlik, LL; Pikanowski, RA; McMillan, DG								The Hudson-Raritan Estuary as a crossroads for distribution of blue (Callinectes sapidus), lady (Ovalipes ocellatus), and Atlantic rock (Cancer irroratus) crabs								FISHERY BULLETIN				102	4			693	710						OCT 2004	2004	Blue (Callinectes sapidus) (Portunidae), lady (Ovalipes ocellatus) (Portunidae), and Atlantic rock (Cancer irroratus) (Cancridae) crabs inhabit estuaries on the northeast United States coast for parts or all of their life cycles. Their distributions overlap or cross during certain seasons. During a 1991-94 monthly otter trawl survey in the Hudson-Raritan Estuary between New York and New Jersey, blue and lady crabs were collected in warmer months and Atlantic rock crabs in colder months. Sex ratios, male: female, of mature crabs were 1:2.0 for blue crabs, 1:3.1 for lady crabs, and 21.4:1 for Atlantic rock crabs. Crabs, 1286 in total, were sub-sampled for dietary analysis, and the dominant prey taxa for all crabs, by volume of foregut contents, were mollusks and crustaceans. The proportion of amphipods and shrimp in diets decreased as crab size increased. Trophic niche breadth was widest for blue crabs, narrower for lady crabs, and narrowest for Atlantic rock crabs. Trophic overlap was lowest between lady crabs and Atlantic rock crabs, mainly because of frequent consumption of the dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis) by the former and the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) by the latter. The result of cluster analysis showed that size class and location of capture of predators in the estuary were more influential on diet than the species or sex of the predators.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0090-0656			WOS:000224724000011

A total of 195 individuals were captured. The species collected were Galiteuthis glacialis, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, Histioteuthis atlantica, H. eltaninae, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Batoteuthis skolops and Pholidoteuthis boschmai. Concentrations of squid were low, ranging from 4.4 to 174.7 individuals 100,000(-3). The majority of squid captured were G. glacialis (174 individuals, 89.2% of all squid captured), and most of these (n = 171) were small paralarvae < 25 mm in mantle length. G. glacialis were distributed predominantly west of 120&DEG;E in water that was colder, and where the distance from the coastline of the southern boundary of the Antarctic circumpolar current (SB-ACC) was maximal. This water mass had greater concentrations of phytoplankton, was more productive and had maximal sea-ice extent compared to the water mass east of 120&DEG;E. G. glacialis was therefore more abundant in water where the majority of krill and krill predators were present compared to warmer oceanic waters of the ACC to the east, where salps dominated.

J	O'Connell, MF; Dempson, JB								The biology of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, of Gander Lake, a large, deep, oligotrophic lake in Newfoundland, Canada								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				64	1-3			115	126		10.1023/A:1016001423937				JUN 2002	2002	Resident Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, are widespread throughout the island of Newfoundland. This study examines aspects of the biology and spatial and temporal distributions of the charr of Gander Lake, the third largest in Newfoundland (surface area = 11320 ha, maximum depth = 288 m, mean depth = 105.4 m). The deepest part of the lake is approximately 258 m below sea level. The lake is well oxygenated from the surface to the bottom during all seasons. Sampling was conducted with Lundgren multiple-mesh experimental gillnets and baited hooks. There appears to be two morphs present, based on colour (dark and pale) and certain meristic characteristics. Dark charr were caught mainly in benthic nets (at depths from I to 100 m inclusive) with only a few pelagic captures. Pale charr were caught only in benthic nets at depths between 20 and 100 in inclusive. The maximum depth sampled was 196 m, but there was no catch. There was a tendency for dark charr to be found in deeper, cooler water as the upper water column and inshore areas warmed during summer. There was no apparent trend in size of charr with depth sampled. Dark and pale charr both fed on benthic macroinvertebrates; sticklebacks were consumed only by dark charr and the importance of this prey item increased with size of predator. Zooplankton and surface food were not utilised by Gander Lake charr. Results of the study are compared with findings reported for other water bodies in Newfoundland and Labrador, North America, and Europe, particularly Loch Ness which has similarities in morphometry and trophic status to Gander Lake.					4th International Charr Symposium4th International Charr Symposium	JUN 25-JUL 01, 2000JUN 25-JUL 01, 2000		TROIS RIVIERES, CANADATROIS RIVIERES, CANADA	23	0	0	0	24	0	25			0378-1909			WOS:000177002400009		
J	Coyner, DF; Schaack, SR; Spalding, MG; Forrester, DJ								Altered predation susceptibility of mosquitofish infected with Eustrongylides ignotus								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				37	3			556	560		10.7589/0090-3558-37.3.556				JUL 2001	2001	Eustrongylides ignotus is a parasitic nematode whose definitive hosts are often piscivorous wading birds (Ciconiiformes). Sever species of small fishes are intermediate hosts, while larger predatory fish may be paratenic (transport) hosts. We examined predation susceptibility of infected mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to three species of predatory fishes, including juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salminoides), warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). A 250 L aquarium with removable plexiglass divider and remote observation windows was constructed. Aquatic macrophytes were placed in the tank to provide refuge for the fishes. Predatory fish were allowed to acclimate to one half of the tank, while one infected and one uninfected mosquitofish were placed in the other. The divider was removed a-ad an observer recorded the number of capture attempts and time required for capture. Predators were observed for behavioral alterations for 4 days after ingestion of infected mosquitofish, then examined at necropsy. Infected prey were selected preferentially in 31 of 38 (82%) trials. The number of capture attempts was 2.7 +/- 0.2 ((x) over bar +/- SE) for infected fish and 3.9 +/- 0.4 for uninfected fish. Mean time of capture was 12.4 +/- 1.6 min for infected fish and 21.7 +/- 2.9 for uninfected fish. Because of these differences, infected mosquitofish were more susceptible to predation (P < 0.01) than uninfected fish. Aberrant behavior including lethargy, convulsions, and buoyancy abnormalities was observed in eight (67%) predatory fish. At necropsy, larvae of E. ignotus were found in the coelomic cavity, viscera, and swim bladders of predators. Parasite-induced behavior modification of intermediate hosts may predispose them to predation by wading birds and thereby facilitate the transmission of this nematode in natural populations.									18	1	0	0	15	1	20			0090-3558	1943-3700		WOS:000170227300014	11504229

We examined correlations between local climatic conditions, body temperature and activity in adult, basking lowland copperheads (Austrelaps superbus) from two localities (warm-temperate versus cool-temperate) in south-eastern Australia. We also collected data from highland copperheads (Austrelaps ramsayi) at a locality with cold-temperate climate. We found that across the active season, mean body temperatures were similar among localities (approximately 27 degreesC) irrespective of species. In contrast, activity times differed. Cool-temperate A. superbus emerged earlier in spring and in the morning and retreated earlier in the evening and in autumn than their conspecifics from the warm-temperate locality. Spring emergence was correlated with yearly fluctuations in thermal conditions, suggesting that activity times depend on environmental temperatures. Predator-prey interactions influenced body temperature and activity to some extent in spring when warm-temperate A. superbus with relatively low body temperatures (as low as 18.5 degreesC) were captured around ponds in which they had been foraging for frogs. Austrelaps ramsayi from the cold-temperate locality not only displayed a later emergence in spring and reduced daily activity times compared with warm and cool-temperate A. superbus but also compared with A. ramsayi, as reported from a warmer locality in eastern Australia. These data indicate that activity times vary on a geographic basis while snake body temperatures largely remain inflexible. The surprising exception was that cold-temperate A. ramsayi retreated later in autumn than cool-temperate A. superbus, and at that time they showed body temperatures as low as 12.5 degreesC, well below those we had recorded for A. superbus. We suggest that A. ramsayi retreat later in autumn because they need to extend their reproductive season and that this is mediated via adaptive changes in the critical minimum body temperature, as has been reported for other snakes.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0004-959X	1446-5698		WOS:000170397000003		
J	Rayor, LS; Uetz, GW								Age-related sequential web building in the colonial spider Metepeira incrassata (Araneidae): an adaptive spacing strategy								ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				59				1251	1259		10.1006/anbe.2000.1427				JUN 2000	2000	Colonial orb-weaving spiders provide insight into the proximate mechanisms by which social animals space themselves within a group. We examined mechanisms for the temporal patterns of web building that determine individual positions in Metepeira incrassata (Araneidae) colonies. The spiders display a characteristic age-related sequence of daily web building, with larger spiders completing their webs significantly earlier than smaller ones. We used data on behavioural interactions, web building, prey capture and predator attacks to evaluate four hypotheses. (1) Larger spiders are better competitors and pre-empt optimal spatial positions. (2) Smaller spiders reduce competition with larger individuals by building webs later. (3) Prey captured by different size classes is available at different times. (4) Differential predation risk determines web-building times. Large individuals dominated behavioural interactions. Disturbances by larger spiders during web construction significantly delayed the completion of smaller individuals' webs and precipitated movements to new web sites. One prediction of the first hypothesis, that spatial needs translate into earlier building, was confirmed by significantly earlier web building by mature females with egg sacs (which are unable to move their egg sacs:) compared with same-sized females without eggs (which can change locations freely). Experiments to determine whether the presence of large spiders inhibited the web building of smaller individuals were equivocal. Prey availability and risk of predation are not factors affecting web-building patterns. Sequential web building appears to be a result of both larger spiders competing to pre-empt space from one another and smaller individuals attempting to reduce conflict during web construction. Sequential web building is a proximate mechanism that influences spacing among colonial orb-weaving spiders and helps shape the typical hierarchical size distribution of spiders within the colony. Similar spacing mechanisms may be seen in colonial birds and marine invertebrates.

J	Morse, DH								Distribution, movement, and activity patterns of an intertidal wolf spider Pardosa lapidicina population (araneae, lycosidae)								JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY				25	1			1	10						1997	1997	The wolf spider Pardosa lapidicina Emerton 1885 occupies cobble beaches above the tide line about Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, and migrates back and forth with the tides. To my knowledge this is the first explicit report of such behavior in a spider. The species is common, attaining densities of over 30 individuals/0.5 m of shoreline. The spiders are confined to the beach from April until November, and 33% or more of the population moves back and forth with diurnal tides during clear or warm weather. Individuals may migrate on one day but remain above the tide line on the next. Small numbers remain on the highest part of the beach through most or all of the winter; others retire into the adjacent coastal scrub. Spiders occupy both stretches of open beach and beach with fringing salt-marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) beds. Those in the latter habitat do not migrate through Spartina after it has reached high density in June, remaining confined to the upper reaches of the beach. Numbers of P. lapidicina on open stretches of the beach exceed those in Spartina areas, and they appear to experience higher mortality in the latter area. Spiders in the low intertidal move frequently and hunt actively (cursorial strategy), those above the tideline move only 0.1 times as often and sun-bask frequently (sit-and-wait strategy). Individuals hunting in the low intertidal may capture more than one prey per day, including Diptera, Collembola, and amphipods.									31	0	0	0	28	0	32			0161-8202			WOS:A1997XC98600001

One factor affecting the magnitude of the lift force is the area of the propulsor. Resistance to cruising and sprints is mainly due to drag, but inertia is important during maneuvers when animals accelerate or turn. The inertia of the body and entrained water, which is proportional to body volume, resists acceleration. Because a thrust that is proportional to surface area is used to maneuver a resistance that is proportional to volume, acceleration performance and maneuverability are expected to decline with increasing size. This trend is ameliorated to some extent by the high swimming speeds attainable by warm-bodied vertebrates and the reduced resistance to acceleration characteristic of the skeletons of dolphins and ichthyosaurs. Maneuvers are essential for capture of elusive prey and avoidance of predators. As they increase in size, aquatic vertebrates use various means to ensure that their prey are less maneuverable than they. These include consumption of increasingly smaller prey relative to predator body size (culminating in filter feeding by the largest aquatic vertebrates); behaviors to concentrate, disturb, and disorient prey; and ambushing or suction feeding that avoid whole-body acceleration. Advantages of warm muscles are seen in the ability of endotherms to take more maneuverable prey than can ectotherms of teh same size. Young stages of large aquatic vertebrates could be especially vulnerable to predators; viviparity or spawning in productive patches provides for rapid growth through vulnerable stages.									74	0	0	0	65	0	75			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:A1990EQ37000008

However, research has shown that fish can experience considerable stress during a C&R event. The physiological response of fishes is typically assessed by measuring the concentrations of blood-plasma cortisol, blood glucose and blood lactate. Members of the family Sparidae are extensively targeted in many warm-temperate coastal fisheries, and the bronze breamPachymetopon grandeis one of the most commonly captured sparids in the South African marine shore-based fishery. The aim of this study was to map the time-course of the physiological-stress response (PSR) after a simulated C&R event to determine the optimal blood-sampling time for assessing the physiological impact of C&R angling in the field. A general additive mixed model identified a significant effect of time on plasma cortisol (p= 0.005), blood glucose (p< 0.001) and blood lactate (p= 0.037), with plasma cortisol peaking at approximately 65 minutes and blood glucose at 86 minutes post-stress. In contrast, blood lactate continued to rise with no clear peak during the 125-minute sampling period. These results suggest that blood sampling should take place between 50 and 75 minutes after a C&R event. Despite a clear response, the PSR ofP. grandewill likely be greater in a true C&R event as this study made use of a simulated fight and used best handling practices. In addition, the prolonged physiological impacts of C&R may have negative consequences for the survival of this species in the high-energy, predator-rich coastal marine environment.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1814-232X	1814-2338		WOS:000547757000001

In northern New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Philippines, shell adzes appear during this period alongside contact between islands. In this paper we present new data from the site of Asitau Kuru, Timor-Leste, to show that the creation of shell adzes and greater inter-island connectivity also characterizes the early and middle and early Holocene in the Nusa Tenggara archipelago of southern Wallacea. We suggest that one of the functions of these shell adzes was in making dugout canoes enabling regular access to neighboring islands; the import of exotic stone materials; long-term occupation of very small islands; and, with new hook and line technology, the capture of more fish. This evidence predates the Neolithic in the region and corroborates a linguistic hypothesis that there was a pre-Austronesian interaction sphere covering much of Wallacea.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1556-4894	1556-1828		WOS:000477117000001

Reservoirs can delay downstream migrations by juvenile salmon for months or years. Here, we examine whether a novel management activity implementing annual short-term draining of a reservoir to streambed improves timely downstream migration of juvenile salmonids. We analyse 12 years of fish capture data from a screw trap located downstream of Fall Creek Reservoir (Oregon, USA) to examine changes in timing of passage out of the reservoir and to compare fish species composition pre- and post-draining. We observed a contraction in the timing of downstream migration for juvenile Chinook Salmon and reduction of yearlings in years following draining. We suggest that briefly draining the reservoir to streambed leads to reduced abundance of warm-water invasive fishes in the reservoir after it refills. These changes could decrease predation and shift competition between invasive and resident riverine-adapted native fishes in the reservoir. Collectively, our findings suggest that this low-cost reservoir management option may improve passage and connectivity for juvenile Chinook Salmon while also decreasing the abundance of invasive fish species in the reservoir. This case study underscores the crucial need for further evaluations of reservoir draining in other systems and contexts.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			1936-0584	1936-0592		WOS:000478624900001	31762869

We studied size, condition, and abundance of juvenile chum salmon (O. keta) captured in July in Icy Strait, Alaska over 17 years (1997 - 2013). We investigated relationships between these juvenile chum salmon characteristics and a suite of marine variables expressed at basin-wide, regional, and local scales using correlation and multivariate analyses. Juvenile chum salmon tended to be longer in years with warmer sea-surface temperatures in spring and summer. Average energy density was higher in years when variables such as local winds and mixed-layer depth indicated enhanced water-column mixing in June and July. Marine factors at the regional scale, specifically freshwater discharge and upwelling, were associated with the abundance of juvenile chum salmon. Catch per unit effort of juvenile chum salmon was higher in years with greater freshwater discharge and more intense downwelling in the prior winter, suggestive of mechanisms increasing recruitment of juvenile chum salmon through enhanced primary productivity and possibly reduced predation risk. Overall, our study supported previous work suggesting that a strong Aleutian Low indicates good conditions for salmon recruitment in the Gulf of Alaska, although we found that local conditions explained more variation in juvenile chum salmon responses than did basin-scale climate indicators. Furthermore, our work revealed a compelling role for freshwater discharge in driving ecological mechanisms that influence the growth and survival of juvenile salmon in the nearshore marine waters of Southeast Alaska.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0967-0645	1879-0100		WOS:000484647900023

Ecosystem impacts of tuna purse-seine fishing associated with fish aggregating devices in the western Pacific Warm Pool Province								FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY				28	1			94	112		10.1111/fog.12389				JAN 2019	2019	The western and central Pacific Ocean supports the world's largest tuna fisheries. Since the 1990s, the purse-seine fishery has increasingly fished in association with fish aggregating devices (FADs), which has increased catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas and vulnerable bycatch species (e.g., sharks). This has raised concerns regarding the sustainability of these species' populations and the supporting ecosystem, but may provide improved food security of Pacific Island nations through utilisation of FAD-associated byproduct species (e.g., wahoo). An ecosystem model of the western Pacific Warm Pool Province was used to explore the potential ecological impacts of varying FAD fishing effort (+/- 50% or 100%) over 30 years. The ecosystem has undergone a significant change in structure since 1980 from heavy exploitation of top predators (e.g., tunas) and "fishing up the food web" of high-trophic-level non-target species. The ecosystem appeared resistant to simulated fishing perturbations, with only modest changes (<10%) in the biomass of most groups, although some less productive shark bycatch species decreased by up to 43%, which had a subsequent positive effect on several byproduct species, the prey of sharks. Reduction of FAD effort by at least 50% was predicted to increase the biomass of tuna species and sharks and return the ecosystem structure to a pre-industrial-fishing state within 10 years. Spatial disaggregation of the model and integration of economic information are recommended to better capture ecological and economic changes that may result from fishing and/or climate impacts and to develop appropriate management measures in response.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000453017200008

Reliable estimates of mortality have been a major gap in our understanding of population ecology for marine animals. This is especially true for juveniles, which are often the most vulnerable age class and whose survival can strongly influence population growth. Thousands of pop-up archival satellite tags (PAT) have been deployed on a variety of marine species, but analysis of these data has mainly been restricted to movement ecology and post-handling survival following fisheries bycatch. We used PAT data to provide empirical estimates of annual survival and cause-specific mortality for juveniles of a marine top predator.2. We tagged and tracked juvenile white sharks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean to (1) estimate survival rates and competing risks and (2) investigate intrinsic and environmental influences on mortality risk. We also evaluated the use of PAT data with respect to meeting assumptions of known-fate survival models.3. Annual juvenile survival rate was 0.632 (SE = 0.15) and annual natural mortality rate (0.08, SE = 0.06) was lower than the rate of gillnet interactions (0.48, SE = 0.15). Mortality risk decreased with greater body length and was significantly greater (hazard ratio = 9.05, SE = 0.70) for juvenile sharks in Mexican waters, relative to California waters.4. The PAT data allowed for unambiguous determination of fate in most cases, aided by collaborative relationships with fishers and secondary tags deployed on a subset of sharks. Although caution must be exercised to establish whether assumptions are met, our work demonstrates that PAT data represent a widely available, untapped data source that could dramatically increase our understanding of marine population ecology.5. Synthesis and applications. Our research shows fisheries bycatch to be the main source of mortality for juvenile white sharks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, highlighting the need for best practices, such as releasing sharks quickly following incidental capture. Furthermore, mortality risk for juveniles was greater in Mexican waters, such that survival may be lower in colder years when juveniles are likely to move south seeking warmer water. This could increase stochasticity in juvenile survival and negatively influence population growth for this apex predator.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000447296300034

Despite the importance of these species, knowledge of their abundance, distribution, and interactions with predators is often limited. On Middleton Island, Alaska, USA, we coupled biologging (GPS-depth logging) with long-term diet observations to examine the use of rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata chick diets as an ecologically relevant method to sample forage fish in the Gulf of Alaska. Individual rhinoceros auklets did not specialize on select prey items but did specialize on 1 of 2 foraging sites, foraging either in coastal waters or the continental shelf. The majority of forage fish in bill-loads were captured in the top 15 m of the water column. Prey composition in auklet bill-loads varied among and within sampling years (2003-2016). Capelin Mallotus villosus dominated auklet diets during the cold-water period with negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation values (2008-2013), whereas Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus were more common in warmer years. Bill-load composition changed within years, with sand lance and capelin delivered to younger chicks, and larger fish, like sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, being introduced as the chicks aged. Auklets returned with sand lance in foraging areas where trawling detected none, implying that auklets can potentially detect fish availability at finer resolutions than conventional methods. In conclusion, auklets responded to variation in forage fish among and across years. These changes in seabird diet could expand our knowledge of changes in availability of important prey species.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000449165100017

Additionally, we assessed the effects of spatial scale on the predictive capabilities of environmental variables.LocationTime periodGlobal oceans.2000 to 2015.Major taxa studiedMethodsTunas: Thunnus albacares, Thunnus obesus, Thunnus alalunga.We undertook a global compilation and meta-analysis of the bulk nitrogen stable isotope ratios (N-15 values) of three tuna species (n=4,281). After adjusting for regional variations in baseline N-15 values using a global ocean biogeochemistry model, generalized additive mixed models were employed to infer global-scale oceanographic controls of trophic structure, using cosmopolitan tuna species as a model.ResultsMain conclusionsFor the three tuna species, variation in trophic position estimated using bulk N-15 values was largely explained by geographical location and the corresponding oxygen minimum layer depth. Tuna trophic positions declined in areas with reduced oxygen at depth. Food-chain length, as captured by maximum trophic position, was longer in areas of the western Pacific Ocean and shorter in the northern Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. Trophic adaptability of the tuna predators, as indicated by intraspecific variability, was highest in the western and central Pacific Ocean and lowest in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Our analysis demonstrated that while tunas share similar functional trophic roles, deeper-foraging tuna species had higher trophic positions globally. The predictive capacity of environmental variables decreased at finer (regional) spatial scales.Our work suggests that habitat compression resulting from the predicted global expansion of oxygen minimum zones with ocean warming will impact the trophic structure of marine food webs and the corresponding foraging habits of marine predators. Spatial scale analyses highlighted the importance of representing differences in regional ecological dynamics in global-scale trophic and ecosystem models.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000448647200004

A test, linking space-time occurrence models and population demographics								ECOGRAPHY				41	6			938	957		10.1111/ecog.03098				JUN 2018	2018	Social learning can be fundamental to cohesive group living, and schooling fishes have proven ideal test subjects for recent work in this field. For many species, both demographic factors, and inter- (and intra-) generational information exchange are considered vital ingredients in how movement decisions are reached. Yet key information is often missing on the spatial outcomes of such decisions, and questions concerning how migratory traditions are influenced by collective memory, density-dependent and density-independent processes remain open. To explore these issues, we focused on Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, a long-lived, dense-schooling species of high commercial importance, noted for its unpredictable shifts in winter distribution, and developed a series of Bayesian space-time occurrence models to investigate wintering dynamics over 23 yr, using point-referenced fishery and survey records from Icelandic waters. We included covariates reflecting local-scale environmental factors, temporally-lagged prey biomass and recent fishing activity, and through an index capturing distributional persistence over time, derived two proxies for spatial memory of past wintering sites. The previous winter's occurrence pattern was a strong predictor of the present pattern, its influence increasing with adult population size. Although the mechanistic underpinnings of this result remain uncertain, we suggest that a 'wisdom of the crowd' dynamic may be at play, by which navigational accuracy towards traditional wintering sites improves in larger and/or denser, better synchronized schools. Wintering herring also preferred warmer, fresher, moderately stratified waters of lower velocity, close to hotspots of summer zooplankton biomass, our results indicative of heightened environmental sensitivity in younger cohorts. Incorporating spatiotemporal correlation structure and time-varying regression coefficients improved model performance, and validation tests on independent observations one-year ahead illustrate the potential of uniting demographic information and non-stationary models to quantify both the strength of collective memory in animal groups and its relevance for the spatial management of populations.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:000434091800008

We focus on spatial trends and physical-biological interactions as a framework to compare model output to localized or season-specific observations. Data on pollocic (>= 8 cm) diet were used to evaluate energy flows and zooplankton dynamics predicted by the model. Model validation shows good agreement to sea-ice cover albeit with a one month delay in ice retreat. Likewise, the timing of spring phytoplankton blooms in the model were delayed approximately one month in the south and extend further into summer, but the relative timing between the spring and fall bloom peaks was consistent with observations. Ice-related primary producers may shift the timing of the spring bloom maximum biomass earlier in years when sea ice was still present after mid-March in the southern regions. Including the effects of explicit, dynamic fish predation on zooplankton in the model shifts the seasonal spring peak and distribution of zooplankton later in the year relative to simulations with implicit predation dependent only on zooplanlcton biomass and temperature; the former capturing the dynamic demand on zooplanlcton prey by fish. Pollock diets based on stomach samples collected in late fall and winter from 1982-2013 show overwintering euphausiids and small pollock as key prey items in the outer and southern Bering Sea shelf; a characteristic not currently present in the model.The model captured two large-scale gradients, supported by field data, characterizing the overall dynamics: 1) inshore to off-shelf physical and biological differences with a gradient in inter-annual variability from higher frequency inshore to lower frequency offshore; and 2) latitudinal gradients in the timing of events. The combined effects of length of day, bathymetry, and tides, which are consistent from year to year, and the two large-scale gradients, characterize the environment on which regional differences were based and restrict their inter-annual and seasonal variability. Thus, the relative timing and sequence of events remained consistent within regions. The combination of model outputs and observational data revealed specific ecosystem processes: (1) The spatial progression in the timing, peaks and sequence of events over the shelf is driven by wind, sea ice, and stratification and creates a seasonal expansion and contraction of the warmer pelagic and bottom habitat suitable to pollock. (2) The seasonal warming of air temperature and the spring-summer expansion of the warm pelagic and bottom habitats influence the ice retreat and the associated ice edge and open water spring blooms, as well as subsequent production/abundance of copepods and euphausiids. (3) These warmer conditions favor pelagic energy flows to pollock ( 10 cm) and allow their distribution to expand shoreward and northward along the shelf break. (4) The fall-winter expansion of the seasonal ice cover drives the contraction of warmer waters towards the outer and southwest shelf and favors benthic energy flows over most of the shelf. There, fall blooms allow for additional lipid storage by large copepods and euphausiids that sink close to the bottom where they either go into diapause or have a restricted diel migration over winter. (5) During these cold months, the preferred pollock habitat shifts and contracts towards the outer and southwest shelf where their increased density and reduced prey availability leads to winter pollock cannibalism and consumption of overwintering euphausiids. Our project highlights the benefits of linking continuous and long-term field work with the development and implementation of highly complex models.

They habitually frequent islands. In California, Chile, and other localities, prehistoric peoples targeted dolphins. Some communities specialised in their capture. Elsewhere, prehistoric human use of cetaceans is attributed to opportunistic exploitation of active or stranded animals. In Meso-and Central America, the scarcity of cetaceans in archaeological sites is inferred to reflect the difficulties of their capture at sea with available technology. An unrecorded regional pattern is evident on Pedro Gonzlez Island in the Pearl Islands (Panama). Remains of bottlenose and common dolphins were found in a Preceramic midden ("Playa Don Bernardo" [PDB]) located in a reef-and mangrove-fringed bay. Eight C-14-dates bracket the deposit between 6200 and 5600 calibrated years BP. The Preceramic strata, which are between 0.8 m and nearly 4 m deep, are capped by a pottery-bearing soil deposited after a 3000-yr. hiatus in occupation. Delphinid bones and teeth represent 8% of 3660 mammal specimens identified to Family in three small test cuts. These cuts represent only 0.7% of the estimated midden area. A minimum of fourteen dolphin individuals is inferred: 11 belong to common dolphin (Delphinus), two to bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops), and one, possibly, to harbour dolphin (cf Stenella). Several bones show evidence for cuts, scrapes and thermal alteration. Some modifications are anthropogenic. Dry season upwelling induces shoaling fish to enter bays in the Pearl Islands attracting their nektonic, avian and dolphin predators. Ecologically, Don Bernardo Bay suits the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and the common bottlenose nose dolphin (Tursiops tuncatus) - the most likely species to be present on the basis of osteology and zoogeography. The opportunistic use of naturally beached dolphins is one hypothesis for their procurement at PDB. Another is intentional human interference: corralling and driving dolphins with watercraft when they entered Don Bernardo Bay to feed or under threat from shark attacks. Ethnographic evidence around the world is supportive. PDB's total subsistence strategy was multi-faceted, comprising exploiting dolphins and marine turtles, farming, marine shore collecting, marine coastal fishing, and hunting in island forests and secondary vegetation. The population included experienced seafarers. Among the exploited mammals, dolphins provided easily the largest quantities of edible tissues, fats and oils.

J	Gonzalez, Andres; Vega, Rodrigo; Yanez, Eleuterio								Operational interactions between the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens and purse seine fishing activities in northern Chile								REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA MARINA Y OCEANOGRAFIA				50	3			479	489		10.4067/S0718-19572015000400007				DEC 2015	2015	This study analyzes temporal, spatial, environmental, ecological and fishing variables that contr ibuted to variations in the number of South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) that interacted with the industrial purse seine fishing operations in the north of Chile (18 degrees 21'-24 degrees 00'S). Scientific observers were placed onboard purse seiners vessels between February 2010 and December 2011. Data were modeled using generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). The results show that the variations in the number of sea lions attracted to fishing operations for feeding or attempting to feed on catches, depends on the following variables: Time of haul, Distance to the closest sea lion colony, Sea surface temperature, Target species of the haul, Latitude, and Number of seabirds circling the vessel. After detailed analysis of the significant variables, it can be concluded that the main mechanisms involved in the interaction between the sea lions and the fishing operations were: 1) a strategy used by the sea lions to decrease heat stress during the breeding period (summer) by entering the water when solar radiation is at its peak (around midday), thus notably increasing their presence within the nets during sets that are less than 20 nautical miles from the colonies; and 2) during warm periods the presence of downwelling Kelvin waves decreases the availability of anchovies (Engraulis ringens) in the area. This causes the fleet to change target species and focus on jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), which is generally captured further from the coast and the colonies, significantly decreasing the interaction with local sea lions.									6	0	0	0	3	1	6			0717-3326	0718-1957		WOS:000366288000007

Mouth-hooked, non-bleeding cod kept in a floating net pen showed mortalities >= 40% when angled from > 50 m depth, likely because of cumulative stress from ongoing barotrauma and exposure to warm surface water. In a natural setting, however, cod have the opportunity to descend after release and are not restricted to the surface. In a follow-up study, 97.8% of similarly selected cod managed to dive following immediate release, whereas 2.2% were floaters. No mortality was observed for divers kept in cages, which were lowered to capture depth for 72 h. While the floaters would likely have died in a natural setting, no mortality was observed when they were recompressed and kept at capture depth for 72 h. The occurrence of swim bladder ruptures, swollen coelomic cavities, venous gas embolisms, and gas release around the anus was significantly influenced by capture depth (range 0-90 m). A supplementary radiology study showed inflated swim bladders in 87% of the cod after 72 h, and most barotrauma signs had disappeared after 1 month. This study encourages investigation of survival potential for physoclistous species when high mortalities are assumed but undocumented. Matching natural post-release and containment environment is essential in the experimental setup, as failure to do so may bias survival estimates, particularly when a thermocline is present. Assuming minimal predation, short-term mortality of cod experiencing barotrauma is negligible if cod submerge quickly by themselves and are otherwise not substantially injured. Survival of floaters may be increased by forced recompression to capture depth. Sublethal and long-term impacts of barotrauma remain to be studied. To ensure that cod have sufficient energy to submerge, anglers are encouraged to avoid fighting the fish to exhaustion and to minimize handling before release.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000368251600028

FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISPLAY OF MULTIPLE DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS IN EASTERN INDIGO SNAKES (DRYMARCHON COUPERI)								HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY				10	2			559	571						AUG 2015	2015	The ability to display multiple defensive behaviors may increase the chances of an individual avoiding predation. Morphological and physiological condition often influences the display of particular behaviors. Understanding the factors influencing the display of particular behaviors from a suite of potential behaviors can help understand the conditions under which displaying certain suites of defensive behaviors will confer the greatest advantage. Drymarchon couperi (Eastern Indigo Snake) is a large, non-venomous snake that exhibits multiple visual, auditory, olfactory, and physical defensive behaviors. We studied the responses of wild D. couperi to human capture and examined how the number and presence of individual behaviors were related to extrinsic and intrinsic variables using encounters from 84 snakes. Snakes were more likely to flee from the observer at warmer body temperatures and, once captured, exhibited wide variation in defensive behaviors with less costly (i.e., less aggressive) behaviors predominating. Individuals were more likely to display any type of defensive behavior earlier in the field season (i.e., November through January). However, our variables had relatively little influence on the presence of particular defensive behaviors although, for some behaviors, the probability of displaying a behavior increased as the number of other behaviors exhibited increased. Our study shows that D. couperi defensive behavior is quite variable and that the factors contributing variation are unclear. Environmental factors (e.g., distance to retreat site) or individual predispositions may contribute to some of this variation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2151-0733	1931-7603		WOS:000365085900001

Nicol, Simon/0000-0001-8193-8719			Objective classification of latent behavioral states in bio-logging data using multivariate-normal hidden Markov models								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				25	5			1244	1258		10.1890/14-0862.1				JUL 2015	2015	Analysis of complex time-series data from ecological system study requires quantitative tools for objective description and classification. These tools must take into account largely ignored problems of bias in manual classification, autocorrelation, and noise. Here we describe a method using existing estimation techniques for multivariate-normal hidden Markov models (HMMs) to develop such a classification. We use high-resolution behavioral data from bio-loggers attached to free-roaming pelagic tuna as an example. Observed patterns are assumed to be generated by an unseen Markov process that switches between several multivariate-normal distributions. Our approach is assessed in two parts. The first uses simulation experiments, from which the ability of the HMM to estimate known parameter values is examined using artificial time series of data consistent with hypotheses about pelagic predator foraging ecology. The second is the application to time series of continuous vertical movement data from yellowfin and bigeye tuna taken from tuna tagging experiments. These data were compressed into summary metrics capturing the variation of patterns in diving behavior and formed into a multivariate time series used to estimate a HMM. Each observation was associated with covariate information incorporating the effect of day and night on behavioral switching. Known parameter values were well recovered by the HMMs in our simulation experiments, resulting in mean correct classification rates of 90-97%, although some variance-covariance parameters were estimated less accurately. HMMs with two distinct behavioral states were selected for every time series of real tuna data, predicting a shallow warm state, which was similar across all individuals, and a deep colder state, which was more variable. Marked diurnal behavioral switching was predicted, consistent with many previous empirical studies on tuna. HMMs provide easily interpretable models for the objective classification of many different types of noisy autocorrelated data, as typically found across a range of ecological systems. Summarizing time-series data into a multivariate assemblage of dimensions relevant to the desired classification provides a means to examine these data in an appropriate behavioral space. We discuss how outputs of these models can be applied to bio-logging and other imperfect behavioral data, providing easily interpretable models for hypothesis testing.									13	0	0	0	9	0	13			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000356898400008	26485953	
J	Hill, Jeffrey E.; Lawson, Larry L., Jr.; Hardin, Scott								Assessment of the Risks of Transgenic Fluorescent Ornamental Fishes to the United States Using the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK)								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				143	3			817	829		10.1080/00028487.2014.880741				2014	2014	Three species of transgenic fluorescent ornamental fish are commercially available to the public in the United States-Zebra Danio Danio rerio, Black Tetra Gymnocorymbus ternetzi, and Tiger Barb Systomus tetrazona. Despite qualitative assessments of the risks of these transgenic fishes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and two state agencies, critics argue that the risk assessment and approval processes were not transparent and that the results were never published or otherwise open to scientific scrutiny. We used an internationally recognized risk screening tool, the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK), to provide a transparent, peer-reviewed assessment for the conterminous United States. We found that the three transgenic fluorescent ornamental fishes in question represent a low risk of invasiveness. Any risk is limited to the warmer regions of the country. No potential for hybridization with native species, little history of invasiveness elsewhere, a lack of traits associated with persistence, and small body size coupled with predation-enhancing fluorescence all indicate that the ability of these species to become established and have impacts is limited even in warm regions. Our finding of low risk is consistent with the results of unpublished, qualitative agency assessments using expert panels or in-house expertise. The risk screens identified few data gaps, areas of important uncertainty, or potentially elevated risk levels, thus suggesting that there would be limited gain to committing resources to a full risk assessment. A low-risk result further indicates little need for risk management actions in addition to those already being taken. Risk screens such as FISK can have high value for managers because they capture important elements of risk, providing vital information for assessment and management decisions with relatively small investments in time and funding.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000337624600011

Quantifying free-roaming domestic cat predation using animal-borne video cameras								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				160				183	189		10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.008				APR 2013	2013	Domestic cats (Fells catus) are efficient and abundant non-native predators. Predation by domestic cats remains a topic of considerable social and scientific debate and warrants attention using improved methods. Predation is likely a function of cat behavior, opportunity to hunt, and local habitat. Previous predation studies relied on homeowner reports of wildlife captures from prey returns to the household and other indirect means. We investigated hunting of wildlife by owned, free-roaming cats in a suburban area of the southeastern USA. Specific research goals included: (1) quantifying the frequency of cat interactions with native wildlife, (2) identifying common prey species of suburban cats, and (3) examining predictors of outdoor behavior. We monitored 55 cats during a 1-year period (November 2010-October 2011) using KittyCam video cameras. Participating cats wore a video camera for 7-10 total days and all outdoor activity was recorded for analysis. We collected an average of 38 h of footage from each project cat. Forty-four percent of free-roaming cats hunted wildlife, of which reptiles, mammals, and invertebrates constituted the majority of prey. Successful hunting cats captured an average of 2.4 prey items during 7 days of roaming, with Carolina anoles (Anolis carolinensis) being the most common prey species. Most wildlife captures (85%) occurred during the warm season (March-November in the southern USA). Twenty-three percent of cat prey items were returned to households; 49% of items were left at the site of capture, and 28% were consumed. Our results suggest that previous studies of pet cat predation on wildlife using owner surveys significantly underestimated capture rates of hunting cats. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Faeces of opossums captured alive and stomach contents from dead animals were collected and analyzed. A wide variety of invertebrates (87.2% frequency of occurrence) followed by birds and reptiles (10.64%) occurred both in faeces and stomachs, and fruits were occasionally consumed. Although the Patagonian opossum was reported as a carnivorous species in captivity, feeding mainly on rodents, reptiles, birds and invertebrates, we did not find remains of rodents in the diet of the opossums. We suggest that Patagonian opossums are not an efficient rodent predator in the wild. The high consumption of invertebrates, reptiles, birds and fruits during the warm season when these items are abundant reflects the opportunistic behavior of this species.									5	0	0	0	5	1	6			0717-6538			WOS:000326002500009

Spatial, diet, and seasonal changes in the fish community structure of a Mexican tropical estuary								CIENCIAS MARINAS				38	4			665	676		10.7773/cm.v38i4.2018				DEC 2012	2012	To extend our knowledge about spatial and temporal variations in the structure of estuarine fish communities, diel samplings (collections every 2 h) were carried out every two months over a one-year period in two different habitats (vegetated and nonvegetated). We collected a total of 34,766 individuals, corresponding to 72 species, most of them with marine and tropical affinities. Species richness was significantly higher in the vegetated habitat, whereas abundance (number of fish) was higher in the nonvegetated habitat. The did l pattern of abundance showed peaks at dusk and dawn, whereas richness was higher at night. Seasonally, fish abundance and species richness showed peaks during January, March, and July September, and these peaks were related to the entry of temperate species, production processes in the system, and rainfall pattern. Fish assemblages showed significant differences among habitats, day/night, and months. In the vegetated habitat, Lagodon rhomboides, Menidia beryllina, and Orthopristis chrysoptera were the predominant species. Microphagus species such as Brevoortia gunteri, Brevoortia patronus, and Mugil curema were predominant during the warm, dry season (March-May) and they were more abundant during the day. In contrast, predatory species such as Citharichthys spilopterus and psalms beta were more abundant during the rainy season and their capture was higher at night. The two most numerically abundant species, Anchoa mitchilli and Mean bras martinica, showed a twilight pattern, with abundance peaks at dusk and dawn, respectively. Hence, in Pueblo Viejo Lagoon (Mexico), the spatiotemporal changes in species composition are in part related to predator avoidance and feeding strategies, through a coupling of life histories with the diel and seasonal variation in the availability of resources, the presence of submerged vegetation playing an important role in this dynamic.									5	0	0	0	5	2	5			0185-3880			WOS:000312179800007

Owing to minimum legal sizes and quotas or non-consumptive fishing practices, some afflicted fish are released, raising concerns over the potential for unaccounted fishing mortality. Two experiments were completed to quantify the (1) clinical signs of barotrauma among fish angled from 6 to 120m (experiment 1) and (2) mortality (over 3d) of fish with barotrauma that were released following either no treatment, venting (e.g. needle) or recompression (e.g. release weight) (experiment 2). In experiment 1, barotrauma was evident in some fish angled from 11 m and all from >20 m. Fish were considered to have barotrauma if they had a prolapsed cloaca combined with a distended coelomic cavity and/or gastric herniation into the buccal cavity. Despite similar clinical signs among fish in experiment 2, none died, however, the associated trauma raises welfare concerns. Both recompression and venting offered benefits over no treatment by returning fish to depth quickly and releasing gases. respectively. Nevertheless, the release method should be dictated by the clinical signs of barotrauma and extrinsic conditions, including the competency of the fisher (e.g. for venting), presence of predators (e.g. for recompression), and exposure to sun or warm water (e.g. no treatment). More selective gears, spatial and temporal closures, or possibly replacing minimum legal sizes with quotas in deep water only could also reduce the frequency of barotrauma among released P. auratus and therefore, negative impacts on stocks.

Seventy-two smallmouth bass were captured, implanted with acoustic tags, and released back into the LWSC where they were captured. Smallmouth bass displayed a strong seasonal migration pattern between the LWSC and Lake Washington. Out of 57 smallmouth bass tracked for seasonal movement information, 82% migrated from the LWSC to Lake Washington sometime between June and October. Departure from the LWSC may be related to a combination of factors, such as cessation of spawning activity, reduced water quality conditions, and reduced prey availability. Smallmouth bass <350 mm FL were more likely to overwinter in the LWSC than larger fish and if they did migrate to Lake Washington, they migrated later in August-October. After overwintering in Lake Washington, smallmouth bass moved back into the LWSC between early-March and mid-April. Smallmouth bass returned to the LWSC at the beginning of the spring warming phase, a behavior likely related to spawning activity. Smallmouth bass often showed some degree of site fidelity between years for both spring/summer locations in the LWSC and summer/fall/winter locations in Lake Washington. Because smallmouth bass often have a high degree of spawning site fidelity, there can be different populations within the same water body. Our results provide some preliminary evidence that LWSC smallmouth bass are reproductively isolated from smallmouth bass that inhabit Lake Washington year-round.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0029-344X	2161-9859		WOS:000304092500005

Impacts of ENSO on seabird diet have been documented in several regions but remain unexplored in the warm eastern tropical Pacific. Analysis of 5 yr of data on the blue-footed booby Sula nebouxii, a seabird specialized on small pelagic fish, revealed that both sexes switch diet and capture fewer types of prey when warm El Nino conditions prevail during the breeding season. Moreover, ENSO-related alternations in the relative abundances of anchovies and herrings, the main prey of these boobies and important commercial fishes in the region, were associated with boobies feeding on more and larger anchovies and fewer and smaller herrings during warm El Nino events, and vice versa during cold La Nina episodes. Females consumed herrings more frequently than males across the 5 yr and consistently fed on larger anchovies and herrings than males, with these differences likely due to this booby's reversed sexual size-dimorphism. We conclude that diet composition and prey size of boobies may be sensitive to variation in relative availabilities of different prey species associated with the ENSO, making these birds robust indicators of environmental fluctuations in the warm eastern tropical Pacific. Inter-annual variations in the availability of herrings, probably the most energetically valuable prey for these boobies, may explain the large ENSO-related variations in booby reproduction documented previously.									24	0	0	0	21	0	24			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000307723300021

Transmitted data were obtained from seven tags. An eighth tag was recovered and provided a highly detailed four-month dataset from which several recognizable diving patterns emerged. This M. mola spent considerable time at the surface, possibly warming itself. These apparent basking events were punctuated by regular deep dives below the thermocline to depths as great as 600 m and temperatures as low as 2 degrees C. The vast majority of dives occurred during the day, with relatively little vertical movement at night. Geolocation estimates were possible between tag and release for five individuals. No large, basin-scale movements were apparent with most molas remaining relatively close to their initial tagging location over a six to nine month period. Seasonal movements were apparent for some molas and corresponded to regional shifts in oceanography. Northward movements from the Kuroshio Current into the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Oyashio Current during the summer months coincided with an increase in temperature and reduction in chlorophyll a concentrations in waters near central Japan. In the fall, most molas returned inshore to the coast of Japan. Molas are targeted and incidentally captured by fishermen in these waters, and the information presented here is vital for effective fisheries management and to forecast changes in mola behaviors associated with environmental variability.

The first step to elucidating their ecological importance, however, is an understanding of elasmobranch community structure. Such studies are relatively uncommon, especially in communities where human impacts are thought to be low. We used visual surveys and a variety of capture methods to determine spatial and temporal variation in the species composition of a sandflat elasmobranch community in the relatively pristine ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia. Overall, juvenile batoids dominated the community. Eleven elasmobranch species (10 batoids, 1 shark) were found to inhabit the sandflats during the cold season (June-August) and 21 species (12 batoids, 9 sharks) were recorded during the warm season. The overall density of elasmobranchs occupying the sandflat was also higher during the warm season. Nearshore areas, especially during the warm season, supported the highest densities of elasmobranchs overall as well as the dominant species (giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus, and reticulate whipray, Himantura uarnak). Such high elasmobranch abundance may be driven by a combination of factors including prey availability, predator avoidance, and behavioral thermoregulation. The high species richness and density of elasmobranchs in such a restricted area suggest that elasmobranch mesopredators could exert strong top-down impacts in nearshore environments in the absence of human impacts, but raises questions of how resources are partitioned among apparently similar species in this system.									42	0	0	0	42	2	43			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000270721000014

Thus, it is rarely possible to "restore" pre-disturbance conditions; rather restoration programs (even large, well-funded ones) will nearly always involve multiple small projects, each of which can make some modest change to selected ecosystem processes and habitats. At present, such projects are typically selected based on their attributes as individual projects (e.g., consistency with programmatic goals of the funders, scientific soundness, and acceptance by local communities), and ease of implementation. Projects are rarely prioritized (at least explicitly) based on how they will cumulatively affect ecosystem function over coming decades. Such projections require an understanding of the form of the restoration response curve, or at least that we assume some plausible relations and estimate cumulative effects based thereon. Drawing on our experience with the CALFED Bay-Delta Ecosystem Restoration Program in California, we consider potential cumulative system-wide benefits of a restoration activity extensively implemented in the region: isolating/filling abandoned floodplain gravel pits captured by rivers to reduce predation of outmigrating juvenile salmon by exotic warmwater species inhabiting the pits. We present a simple spreadsheet model to show how different assumptions about gravel pit bathymetry and predator behavior would affect the cumulative benefits of multiple pit-filling and isolation projects, and how these insights could help managers prioritize which pits to fill.									34	0	0	0	21	1	34			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000260952100005	18810527	
J	Manda, Stepan								Palaeoecology and palaeogeographic relations of the Silurian phragmoceratids (Nautiloidea, Cephalopoda) of the Prague Basin (Bohemia)								BULLETIN OF GEOSCIENCES				83	1			39	62		10.3140/bull.geosci.2008.01.039				2008	2008	Phragmoceras and Tubiferoceras are discosorid nautiloid genera with endogastric cyrtoconic to orthoconic breviconic shells possessing a contracted aperture. Because of the constricted aperture phragmoceratids have usually been considered as microphages. The constriction of the aperture appears during the late ephebic stage. Preceding ontogenetic stages possessed a brevicone shell with an open aperture, usually considered to be indicative of nectobenthic predatory lifestyle. The apertural constriction probably improved hydrodynamic control and served as protection for the soft body. Attachment sites for distinct retractor muscles suggest evidence of potentially fast movement of the head-arm complex out of the aperture with consequent capture of larger prey. Phragmoceratids are a characteristic component of Silurian nautiloid faunas, which inhabited the mainly tropical carbonate platforms of Baltica and Laurentia. Phragmoceratids closely related to those of the Baltic and Avalonia occasionally appeared in the Prague Basin, which was located in the temperate zone at the northern margin of peri-Gondwana. The distribution pattern of phragmoceratids suggests that immigration into the Prague Basin occurred in three stages: (1) first appeared stray immigrants (or occasional visitors) from warmer seas, this stage of immigration reflecting activation of sea currents after the early Silurian widespread anoxia in peri-Gondwana (latest Llandovery-early Wenlock); (2) appearance of small endemic palaeo-populations of migrants (with evidence of local hatching of phragmocerids) that persisted only briefly during the early Homerian and early Gorstian low stands; (3) stable palaeo-populations appeared in the Early Ludfordian, with occurrence of endemic taxa related to the forms known from Baltica-Avalonia, suggesting stable conditions for nautiloid evolution. The Middle Ludfordian Kozlowskii Event caused the extinction of the last phragmocerid taxa in the Prague Basin as elsewhere. Nautiloid immigration to the Prague Basin (Perunica microplate) indicates that Perunica, in contrast to peri-Gondwanan areas, was within reach of the South Tropical Current since the latest Llandovery. Many other nautiloid families show a similar migration pattern although timing of the immigrations do not necessarily correlate. Thus the nautiloids provide useful data for palaeobiogeographic and climate reconstruction, such analysis can be made precise by comparison of nautiloid clades.									42	0	0	0	20	0	45			1214-1119			WOS:000256625200004

The response variable, survival rate, was associated with smolt size, release date, sea surface temperature in May, and prey fish abundance, and interactions among these factors. The effect of smolt size was in interaction with Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) abundance; smolt size had an optimum of about 22 cm in years when herring were abundant, but when herring were less abundant, the survival of larger smolts was higher. Early stocking in warm springs or late stocking in cold springs gave the best survival rates for trout. Changes in return activity or fishing methods have made tag returns a less reliable way of estimating survival during the last 30 years. The actual return rate of undersized fish (< 40 cm) compared with their estimated proportion among captured fish decreased over time, which suggests that the survival rate for the later years was probably underestimated. It is likely that we were unable to include all the relevant explanatory variables in the model, as year effects remained significant, suggesting unknown annual variation affecting survival.									17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000249973700003

We investigated the existence of two species of wood mice in warm-temperate forests ranging from a reserved belt of evergreen broad-leaved trees to a coniferous plantation, and analyzed the relationship between wood mouse occurrence and environmental factors to confirm their microhabitat use. We used two-way analysis of variance to analyze differences in the captured number of each wood mouse species in two trapping seasons as well as two stand types to confirm the interaction between the stand type and trapping season. Apodemus speciosus were often captured in the reserved belt, while captures of A. argenteus were independent of season and stand types. It is reasonable to conclude from the results of the trends in occurrence that the two species of wood mice showed different uses of the microhabitat. The result of linear discriminant analysis made it clear that the distance from the reserved belt had much to do with the difference in microhabitat use between the two species in the fruiting season of Quercus and Castanopsis. On average, A. speciosus moved 19.9m during nonfruiting and 61.3m during fruiting, while A. argenteus moved 8.1m during nonfruiting, and 29.0m during fruiting from analysis of the recapture position. The results indicate that both species of mice move around during the fruiting season more than in the nonfruiting season.					115th Annual Meeting of the Japanese-Forestry-Society115th Annual Meeting of the Japanese-Forestry-Society	APR   03, 2004APR   03, 2004	Japanese Forestry SocJapanese Forestry Soc	Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, JAPANUniv Tokyo, Tokyo, JAPAN	3	0	0	0	3	0	4			1341-6979			WOS:000240059300008

Since estuarine species often exhibit an ontogenetic shift in habitat requirements or preferences we examined Capture per Unity of Effort by size class (CPUE-SC) and split species into "size ecological taxa" (SET) for analysis. The use of CPUE-SC also allowed the abundance of a SET to be computed by summing the mean CPUE of each size class within that SET and use this information to follows SET's temporal and or spatial abundance. A total of 65 and 63 species was collected during a year of bottom trawling in the Patos Lagoon and York River estuaries, respectively. In both localities the strongest modal size class was < 80 mm TL, and several abundant species were smaller than 100 mm TL. The size between 80 and 100 TL effectively separated several species into discrete SET's in both systems. Those SET's could have different ecological preferences, temporal and spatial distributions and so identified as different "ecological taxa". In warm months, when predation by large fish is most likely, the abundance of fish between 80 and 100 mm TL in "bottom trawl" demersal fish assemblages was low in both systems. Only the sea catfishes, in Patos Lagoon, protected by strong dorsal and pectoral spines, and the Hogchoker, in the York River, protected by burrowing in the bottom substrate, peak in abundance at this size class. The seasonal pattern of estuarine use was similar between localities and did not differ from other warm-temperate estuarine fish assemblages.									23	0	0	0	25	9	25			0101-8175			WOS:000236695600017

Among the world's eastern boundary current systems, it is the most exposed to high climatic stress and is directly affected by El Nino and La Nina events. In this volatile ecosystem, fish have been led to develop adaptive strategies in space and time. In this paper, we attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying such strategies, focusing on the El Nino 1997-98 in Peru from which an extensive set of hydrographic, capture and acoustic survey data are available. An integrated analysis of the data is crucial, as each has substantial shortcomings individually; for example, both catch data and acoustic surveys may easily lead to wrong conclusions. Existing hypotheses on anchovy and sardine alternations lead us to a 'habitat-based' synthetic hypothesis. Using our data, an integrated approach evaluated how fish responded to habitat variation, and determined the consequences in terms of fish-population variability. Various factors occurring at a range of different spatio-temporal scales were considered: interdecadal regime (warm 'El Viejo'/cool 'La Vieja' decadal scale); strength and the duration of the El Nino Southern Oscillation event (interannual scale); population condition before the event (interannual scale); fishing pressure and other predation (annual scale); changes in reproductive behaviour (intra-annual scale); presence of local upwelling (local scale). During El Nino 1997-98, anchovy was able to exploit a small-scale temporal and spatial 'loophole' inside the general unfavourable conditions. Moreover, sardine did not do better than anchovy during this El Nino and was not able to take advantage of the 'loophole' opened by this short-term event. Our results question the traditional view that El Nino is bad for anchovy and good for sardine.									159	2	1	0	115	16	167			1467-2960	1467-2979		WOS:000226174500002		
J	Davis, MW; Parker, SJ				Davis, Michael/Q-4060-2019				Fish size and exposure to air: Potential effects on behavioral impairment and mortality rates in discarded sablefish								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				24	2			518	524		10.1577/M03-030.1				MAY 2004	2004	Fisheries models often assume that discarded undersized fish and target species will survive and contribute to future recruitment and yield. If smaller fish are more susceptible to capture stressors than larger fish, then the assumption that smaller discards would contribute to recruitment may not be true. We tested the hypothesis that small sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria show more behavioral impairment and mortality than large fish when exposed to air (10-60 min) at various temperatures (10-18degreesC). Sablefish captured by trawl, longline, or trap are commonly exposed to these conditions during warmer seasons when brought up on deck and sorted. Two size-classes of fish (small: 32-49 cm total length [TL]; large: 50-67 cm TL) were used in the experiments. Behavior was measured as upright orientation and startle responses to visual and mechanical stimuli 1, 2, 3, and 24 h after air exposure; mortality was measured through 7 d after air exposure. Small fish mortality increased as air time increased and was at higher levels than in large fish. Only 10 min of air exposure caused behavioral impairment in small and large fish, which could lead to increased predation on discarded fish. At 24 h after air exposure, normal behavior had not generally resumed and small fish had more behavioral impairment than large fish.									46	0	0	0	40	0	46			0275-5947			WOS:000222067500016		
J	Manderson, JP; Pessutti, J; Meise, C; Johnson, D; Shaheen, P								Winter flounder settlement dynamics and the modification of settlement patterns by post-settlement processes in a NW Atlantic estuary								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				253				253	267		10.3354/meps253253				2003	2003	For fishes with bipartite life cycles, locations of high quality nursery grounds are determined by processes controlling larval supply as well as those affecting early juvenile mortality and emigration, From April through June 2000, distributions of settling and early juvenile winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were measured to examine how pre- and post-settlement processes determine the location of the primary nursery ground in the Navesink River/Sandy Hook Bay estuarine system (NSBES), New Jersey. The settlement pattern, measured with fine mesh (3 mm) traps that captured flounder less than or equal to 8 d into the post-metamorphic age but excluded predators and prevented emigration, was spatially dynamic. Fish settled on organically rich substrata (organic content = 5 to 12% by weight) 2 wk earlier in the Navesink River (mid-April through mid-May) than on similar substrata just 15 km downstream in Sandy Hook Bay (May through mid-June). Local retention mechanisms combined with spatial variation in spring warming, which probably affected larval-stage durations, appeared to be responsible for the dynamic settlement pattern. To determine whether spatial patterns of flounder settlement were dramatically altered by post-settlement processes, we compared settler supply (measured using traps) with juvenile distributions (measured using beam trawls, which do not prevent post-settlement mortality and emigration). The index of settler supply explained 95%, of the variation in juvenile abundance patterns in the Navesink River (p < 0.001) where larger juveniles > 20 mm standard length were commonly trawled. However, larger juveniles were nearly absent in Sandy Hook Bay, where juvenile distributions were not related to settlement (r(2) = 0.15, p = 0.31). Thus, the upstream distribution of juvenile winter flounder in the NSBES, which is similar to that observed in other estuarine nurseries, appeared to be produced by the rapid modification of settlement patterns by post-settlement processes. However, pre-settlement processes that produce spatial variation in the timing of settlement could affect the ways in which settlement patterns are modified by age, time and/or size dependent post-settlement processes.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			0171-8630			WOS:000183487200023

Do thermal factors influence foraging-site selection by ectothermic predators? Snake species that obtain their prey from ambush must remain immobile for long periods, precluding overt behavioural thermoregulation; and some "ambush" snakes use thermal cues to detect endothermic prey. Plausibly, alternative ambush sites might differ either in equilibrial body temperatures available to snakes, or in the thermal "background" against which prey items must be detected.2. We examined this topic with field data on pit-vipers (Gloydius shedaoensis) on a small island in northeastern China. Adult snakes feed only on migrating passerine birds. The snakes ambush birds both from arboreal perches (branches of small trees) and from the ground.3. Arboreal versus terrestrial ambush sites differed both in operative temperatures and thermal "backgrounds" available to the snakes. Operative temperatures inside copper models were lower in trees than on the ground (because of wind), and snakes in arboreal ambush sites were cooler than those in terrestrial sites. Thermal backgrounds from arboreal perches were cooler (and thus, provided more contrast against prey items) than did backgrounds available from terrestrial ambush-sites.4. Thermal factors thus modify the suitability of alternative ambush locations for these pit-vipers, but with a trade-off: a snake in a tree can "see" its prey more clearly, but may not be warm enough (and hence, able to strike fast enough) to capture it. Further work is required to determine whether or not snakes actually use such thermal differences as criteria for the selection of ambush sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A warm-core eddy was identified directly east of Eden with a temperature at 250 m depth of 15 degreesC. At the western edge of this eddy, relatively high levels of fluorescence (chlorophyll a) were recorded together with pigments typical of diatoms, a feature of upwelling communities. The biomass of zooplankton and micronekton was also significantly higher at the western edge of the eddy. Similarly, acoustic data showed relatively high concentrations of backscatter at the margins of the eddy, particularly at the shelf break and slope. These areas had the greatest potential prey biomass; a fact supported by the presence of shelf- and slope-associated prey species in the stomachs of yellowfin tuna caught at the same time. Fishery data for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) captures showed that catch per unit effort was highest along the shelf and shelf break. Examination of yellowfin tuna catch records from 1988 to 1998 from south-eastern Australia showed highest catches in 1996, similar to 75% of the catch coming from the western edge of the eddy. We conclude that the presence of a warm-core eddy in the area at this time provided a localized but productive area to which the yellowfin were attracted.									57	2	0	0	41	0	60			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000171168200010

However, recent research has revealed that landscape-level processes such as disturbance, dispersal, and habitat patch mosaic structure may also strongly influence local populations. We studied the population and habitat dynamics of a threatened fish, the Arkansas darter (Etheostoma cragini) at four spatial scales (pool, reach, segment, watershed) in two intermittent Colorado plains streams. At each scale, information on hydrology; habitat, and fish populations was combined to evaluate factors influencing darter persistence. At the pool scale, Arkansas darters persisted in most permanent pools during summer drought, tolerated extremes of hyperthermia and hypoxia, and were extirpated only when pools dried. Deeper pools had a higher probability of persisting during summer drought. At the reach scale, survival measured during an intensive mark-recapture study was high in a stenothermal spring pool, but low in associated downstream pools that froze during winter and had harsh, variable thermal regimes during summer. However, juvenile darters hatched earlier, grew faster, and were relatively more abundant in the warmer downstream pools compared to juveniles in the spring pool, where older fish dominated. Movement rates between the two habitats were relatively low, but adult darters were more mobile, dispersing out of the spring pool in early spring and returning upstream before the onset of summer drought. At the segment scale, flow variation among seasons and years controlled habitat connectivity, thereby affecting dispersal and reproduction and shaping the distribution and age composition of darter populations. At the watershed scale, nonnative northern pike (Esox lucius) preyed on darters, reducing their distribution and abundance in 13 km of Big Sandy Creek and isolating upstream darter populations from those downstream. Large floods scoured new spring-pool refugia and filled other pools, altering the mosaic of physical habitats. A comprehensive picture of factors controlling Arkansas darter populations and their habitat emerged only when physical and biotic processes were integrated across all four scales. To be effective, recovery efforts for species inhabiting variable environments must consider multiple scales, from landscape-level processes that create and maintain refugia to fine-scale factors that regulate the abundance and persistence of local populations.									251	1	0	0	228	2	258			1051-0761			WOS:000165680300016

This species is common and widespread in the region studied. On the basis of the analysis of both the habitats of capture of the various specimens and the results of a logistical regression model, it seems that this species inhabits a wide variety of habitats (including secondary forest patches and the plantation-forest mosaic), and that its local distribution is not influenced by the presence of any macrohabitat parameter. Green mambas were observed both in the dry and in the wet season, without any statistical bias toward a particular season. Adult sex-ratio was approximately 1 : I. Males were significantly longer than females. All adult mamba dietary records involved warm-blooded prey (mainly birds), whereas young mambas fed also upon lizards and toads. Nearly all the prey eaten by adult mambas were arboreal, and thus there was no support for the recent hypothesis that adult mambas develop an orientation to forage on terrestrial rodents. Male-male combats and matings were observed in December, January, and February (dry season), and gravid females were collected in April, May, and June (wet season). Females produced 7-16 eggs (mean 10.9), and litter size was positively correlated with maternal length.									19	0	0	0	18	0	19			0067-8546			WOS:000089610700001

There is evidence for changes in fast-start behaviour with temperature, over acute, seasonal, developmental and evolutionary time scales. Maximum velocity often increases with acute temperature changes. Thermal acclimation can improve fast-start performance, although responses appear to be reduced in more eurythermal species. Changes in performance with thermal acclimation are often reflected at the molecular, biochemical and cellular levels of organisation. There appears to be little compensation in fast-start performance in Antarctic fish compared to warmer water species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The minnows exhibited significant avoidance of traps marked with the alarm pheromone: less than 4% of the minnows that were captured were found in the experimental traps. There was a nonsignificant tendency for minnows in control traps to be larger than those caught in experimental traps, suggesting a possible role of experience or developmental factors in determining the response to alarm pheromone. There was no apparent difference in overall body condition (i.e., length-specific mass) between the minnows that were caught in control versus experimental traps. Detection of the alarm pheromone may allow receivers to avoid areas where risk of predation is high.									55	0	0	0	52	1	56			0008-4301			WOS:A1992JP72000001
