Eggs 1-3 days old of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lep.: Pyralidae), killed by freezing, were used as food. Mean developmental times were found to be 22.4, 8.5 and 7.0 days, respectively. Within the investigated thermal limits the developmental rate showed a linear relationship with temperature and the corresponding thermal threshold for development was calculated to 10.2degreesC.									10	0	0	0	11	1	12			0168-8162			WOS:000174482000003	11989484

The larger species, Hipposideros diadema and Hipposideros maggietaylori, effectively thermoregulated at ambient temperatures down to 9 degreesC, whereas two smaller species, Hipposideros galeritus and Hipposideros cervinus, occasionally permitted body temperatures to fall below 32 degreesC. The low basal rates of metabolism in hipposiderids correlated with a predatory life-style characterized by intermittent flight from a perch to capture insects, a correlation similar to that found in nonpasserine birds. Intermittent-foraging bats and nonpasserines collectively had basal rates of metabolism that averaged 75% of those that pursue insects during protracted flight. However, no difference in basal rate was found between protractedand intermittent-foraging passerines, which had basal rates 1.8- and 2.4-times those of protracted-foraging and intermittent-foraging bats and nonpasserines, respectively. Bats, swifts, and caprimulgids that enter torpor have basal rates that are 85% of those of similar species that do not enter torpor. Body mass, order affiliation, foraging mode, and propensity to enter into torpor collectively account for 97% of the variation in basal rate of metabolism in insectivorous bats and birds. Foraging style therefore appears to be a factor contributing to the diversity in endotherm energetics. Minimal thermal conductance in the genus Hipposideros ranged from 75% to 102% of the mammalian standard. Birds have minimal thermal conductances that are 75% of mammals and intermittent foragers have minimal conductances that are 78% of protracted foragers.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000181647900006	12592442

The results clearly showed the My Flea Trap T, which utilizes an intermittent light to attract fleas, to be far superior in trapping ability to the three continuous light traps; it caught up to 23 times as many fleas as the other traps. Altering the lighting mechanism to provide continuous rather than intermittent light significantly decreased the number of fleas captured. In addition, the use of a green filter significantly increased trapping efficiency, whereas the addition of a heat source had no apparent effect.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			0269-283X			WOS:000297548900008	21787369

The web of S. henscheli has a simple geometrical configuration, comprising a horizontal mat on the sand surface, with a variable number of lobes lined with sticky silk. The sticky silk is renewed daily after being covered by wind-blown sand. In a field experiment, we supplemented the spiders' natural prey with one ant on each day that spiders had active webs and determined the response to an increase in prey. We compared the foraging activity and web geometry of prey-supplemented spiders to non-supplemented controls. We compared the same parameters in food-deprived and supplemented spiders in captivity. The results support the ''costs of foraging'' hypothesis. Supplemented spiders reduced their foraging activity and web dimensions. They moulted at least once and grew rapidly, more than doubling their mass in 6 weeks. By contrast, food-deprived spiders increased foraging effort by enlarging the diameter of the capture web, We suggest that digestive constraints prevented supplemented spiders from fully utilizing the available prey. By reducing foraging activities on the surface, spiders in a prey-rich habitat can reduce the risk of predation. However, early maturation resulting from a higher growth rate provides no advantage to S. henscheli owing to the fact that the timing of mating and dispersal are fixed by climatic factors (wind and temperature). Instead, large female body size will increase fitness by increasing the investment in young during the period of extended maternal care.									44	0	0	0	42	0	44			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:A1996TR65400008	28307123

We examined the effects of single sublethal doses of this organophosphate (OP; low dose = 2.0 mg/kg; high dose = 20 mg/kg; control = vehicle alone) on lizard thermal preference, standard metabolic rate, and prey-capture ability. We also measured activities of plasma total cholinesterase (ChE) and acetylcholinesterase before and at 0, 2, 8, 24, 120, and 504 h after OP dosing. Predose plasma total ChE activity differed significantly between sexes and averaged 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.45 +/- 0.06 mumol/min/ml for males and females, respectively. Approximately 75% of total ChE activity was attributable to butyrylcholinesterase. Peak ChE inhibition reached 19% 2 It after OP ingestion in the low-dose group, and 68% 8 h after ingestion in high-dose animals. Neither OP doses significantly affected diurnal body temperature, standard metabolic rate, or feeding rate. Plasma total ChE levels remained substantially depressed up to 21 d after dosing in the high-dose group, making this species a useful long-term biomonitor of OP exposure in its habitat.									34	2	0	0	36	0	38			0730-7268			WOS:000187897200016	14768874

Efficiency in nitrogen uptake from prey was evaluated by tracing N-15 from N-15-enriched Drosophila flies fed to the plants. The in situ uptake efficiency differed somewhat between species and ranged from 29 to 41% of prey N. This efficiency was not affected by different feeding levels or plant reproductive status (flowering or non-flowering). A test of the amount of N absorbed from prey caught on flower stalks of Pinguicula villosa and P, vulgaris showed that both species took up little of what was available in prey (2.5% or less). The uptake efficiency found in greenhouse grown plants was higher than in plants in situ (40-50% vs. 30-40% respectively). This could probably best be explained by the absence of rain and a higher temperature in the greenhouse. The prey-derived N-15 was traced to reproductive organs and winter buds, Non-flowering individuals allocated 58-97% of the N derived from prey to their winter buds. Flowering individuals allocated 17-43% of the N income from prey to reproduction, while 34-71% were allocated to buds. Root uptake of nitrogen was stimulated by increased prey capture, This increase in uptake of nitrogen from the substrate was larger than the potential direct uptake of nitrogen from captured prey.									41	0	1	0	39	0	42			0029-8549			WOS:A1996UP60000010	28307324

Although arctic arthropods can complete their development at very low temperatures, the predicted climatic changes may shift their phenology outside its normal range. Hence, arctic arthropods may become exposed to conditions to which they are not adapted. On the basis of long-term data from several plots of pitfall and window traps at Zackenberg in high-arctic Northeast Greenland, we document that the timing of emergence is closely related to date of snowmelt in nine taxa of common surface-active and flying arthropods. Average air temperature seemed to play a lesser role, although the duration from snowmelt to the date when 50% of the individuals in the season were caught (date50) was negatively related to the average daily air temperature during the same time interval in three of the nine taxa. Since short-term weather fluctuations appeared to have a small effect on capture numbers in pitfall and window traps, we suggest that timing of snowmelt is a good predictor of the phenology of most arthropods in high-arctic Greenland. The spatial synchrony of capture numbers between individual traps within plots was high. However, among pairs of plots, the spatial synchrony varied between taxa and habitats and declined with distance, between plots for surface-dwelling taxa and with difference in timing of snowmelt for the most abundant families of Diptera (Muscidae and Chironomidae). Detritus feeders (collembolans, mites and most larvae of Diptera) and predators (spiders of the families Linyphiidae and Lycosidae) were abundant throughout the summer season. In contrast, the abundance of more specialized groups, like butterflies (e.g., Nymphalidae) and parasitoid wasps (e.g., Ichneumonidae), was restricted to a narrow seasonal time window in the warmest part of the summer. Because of their narrow phenological range and their host specialization, these taxa may be most vulnerable to trophic mismatch. Furthemore, snowmelt is predicted to become more variable, and this may affect organisms in areas of late snowmelt most severely.									75	1	0	0	71	0	78			0065-2504		978-0-12-373665-9	WOS:000256528000013

Sand flies were captured in peridomestic habitats biweekly for 3 yr. Cross-correlation tests and spectral analysis were used to analyze the simultaneous and lag-time correlations between Lu. longipalpis population densities and abiotic factors of temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and rainfall. Distinct seasonal patterns were observed for males and females, with intervals of 6 mo between population peaks for males and 12 mo for females. Peak female population densities lagged 3 mo behind the maximum annual temperature. Female population density was negatively correlated with relative humidity. An increase in average wind velocity was followed by a decrease in the number of females for 2 wk. Understanding the relationship between the seasonal population dynamics of Lu. longipalpis and abiotic factors will contribute to the design of better control measures to decrease transmission of L. infantum and consequently the incidence of leishmaniasis.									32	0	0	0	24	9	35			0022-2585	1938-2928		WOS:000240605200031	17017238

However, most of this work has focused on increasing temperature, and still little is known about how the variation in temperature extremes will affect community dynamics. We used the model aquatic community held within the leaves of the carnivorous plant, Sarracenia purpurea, to test how food web dynamics will be affected by high temperature variation. We tested the community response of the first (bacterial density), second (protist diversity and composition), and third trophic level (predator mortality), and measured community respiration. We collected early and late successional stage inquiline communities from S. purpurea from two North American and two European sites with similar average July temperature. We then created a common garden experiment in which replicates of these communities underwent either high or normal daily temperature variation, with the average temperature equal among treatments. We found an impact of temperature variation on the first two, but not on the third trophic level. For bacteria in the high-variation treatment, density experienced an initial boost in growth but then decreased quickly through time. For protists in the high-variation treatment, alpha-diversity decreased faster than in the normal-variation treatment, beta-diversity increased only in the European sites, and protist community composition tended to diverge more in the late successional stage. The mortality of the predatory mosquito larvae was unaffected by temperature variation. Community respiration was lower in the high-variation treatment, indicating a lower ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight clear impacts of temperature variation. A more mechanistic understanding of the effects that temperature, and especially temperature variation, will have on community dynamics is still greatly needed.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000390218300006	27234703

Furthermore, it provides key elements for the management of its artificial mass rearing. The purpose of this research was to build the life table of the predator Eriopis connexa under laboratory conditions. From a laboratory colony of the coccinellid, fed with the aphid Myzus persicae, a population was observed from egg to adult, under temperature conditions of 25.5°C, 63% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 12:12. The mortality of each stage and instar was recorded, as well as the proportion of adult females obtained, the number of eggs laid per female every fifth day, its fertility and the adult longevity. With these data the following population parameters were estimated: net reproduction rate of 16.07; generation time of 30.47 days; intrinsic natural growth rate of 0.072; finite multiplication rate of 1.08 and duplication time of 9.6 days. It was concluded that the population of E. connexa under the studied situations showed a high potential of establishment and growth, facilitating its use as biological control agent of arthropod pests when incorporated in agro-ecosystem and, furthermore, offers a good potential for its artificial rearing.	El conocimiento de los parámetros demográficos de una población de insectos permite determinar sus posibilidades para establecerse y crecer bajo ambientes específicos.

El objetivo de ese trabajo fue construir una tabla de vida del cucarrón depredador Eriopis connexa, en condiciones de laboratorio. A partir de una cría de laboratorio de este cucarrón alimentado con el áfido Myzus persicae, se observó un fragmento de la población desde el estado de huevo hasta la muerte del estado adulto, en escenarios de 25,5°C de temperatura, humedad relativa de 60 a 70% y fotoperíodo de 12:12. Se registró la mortalidad para cada uno de los estados e instares, la proporción de hembras adultas, el número de huevos puestos por hembra cada cinco días y su fertilidad y la longevidad de los adultos. Con estos datos, se estimaron los siguientes parámetros de la población: tasa de reproducción neta, de 16,07; tiempo generacional, de 30,47 días; tasa intrínseca de crecimiento natural, de 0,072; tasa finita de multiplicación (λ), de 1,08 y tiempo de duplicación, de 9,6 días. Se concluyó que E. connexa, bajo las condiciones evaluadas, presentó un alto potencial de establecimiento y crecimiento, lo cual, puede facilitar su papel de controlador biológico de insectos plagas al incorporarse en un agro-ecosistema y, además, ofrece un buen potencial para su cría artificial.								3	0	0	0	4	1	5			0123-4226			SCIELO:S0123-42262009000200015

Prostephanus truncatus numbers differed between regions and over time with significant interaction between the two. An overall peak in captures occurred between August and November but this was not apparent in Veracruz and Chiapas. Catches of T. nigrescens also differed but effects were less distinct. The peak in P. truncatus catch was related to monthly rainfall and, with a time lag, minimum temperature in the drier, upland regions, but poorly matched in Chiapas and Veracruz. Prostephanus truncatus abundance was predicted from climatic and habitat data during the periods March to 3 July, and 31 July to November. A regression equation derived from temperature, humidity and rainfall, explained 82% of the variance in the P. truncatus catch in the later period. Local habitat made only a small addition to this model. The best correlate of T. nigrescens numbers was the catch of P. truncatus, but it was less abundant relative to P. truncatus as P. truncatus became more numerous and where annual r.h. was above 70%. Predicted abundance of P. truncatus from the regression model is compared with predictions from laboratory studies of reproductive potential under different climatic regimes. While laboratory studies predict high survival in hot, humid areas, the trap data showed higher catches in cooler, more temperate regions. Possible reasons for these differences and implications for the spread of P. truncatus in Africa are discussed.									14	0	0	0	12	2	17			0007-4853			WOS:A1994QU93300017		
J	Clarke, Andrew								Ecological stoichiometry in six species of Antarctic marine benthos								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				369				25	37		10.3354/meps07670				2008	2008	Elemental (C, N, P) composition was examined in 6 benthic marine invertebrates from Antarctica: 2 suspension feeders (the holothurian Heterocucumis steineni and the polychaete Thelepus cincinnatus), 1 epifaunal grazer (the limpet Nacella concinna), 1 deposit feeder (the polychaete Flabelligera mundata), 1 predator (the nemertean Parborlasia corrugatus) and an omnivore (the asteroid Odontaster validus). Correction for inorganic carbon was necessary only for O. validus, where skeletal carbonate produces a high mineral ash content. Elemental composition of tissue was 49 to 60 % C, 10 to 14 % N and 0.7 to 1.3 % P (all on an organic mass basis); these are all within the normal range of values for aquatic invertebrates. The most variable component was P, though variability was much lower than in stream insects. Stoichiometric molar ratios (C:P, C:N, N:P) were all typical of consumers, with a strong inverse relationship across species between %C and %N in tissue. Stoichiometry varied strongly between phyla, with less variation between species within phyla. There were also indications of variations in elemental composition (C:N ratio and %P) with feeding mode, but the limited range of taxa studied constrains this conclusion. Despite differences in nutrient status, the elemental composition of marine and freshwater benthos were, with the exception of insects, closely similar. Despite the very slow growth rates that characterise polar marine benthos, P contents were relatively high, suggesting that the predictions of the growth rate hypothesis are not upheld at low temperatures.									21	1	0	0	20	1	22			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000260873400003		
J	Canhilal, R; Uygun, N; Carner, GR								Effects of temperature on development and reproduction of a predatory beetle, Nephus includens kirsch (Coleoptera : Coccinellidae)								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY				18	2			117	125						APR 2001	2001	The effect of different temperatures on some biological properties of Nephus includens Kirsch (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was investigated. This species is one of the most important predators of Planococcus citri Risso (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae). The development time, mortality and fecundity were determined at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degreesC and at the variable temperatures, 25-35 degreesC (12 hours 25 degreesC, 12 hours 35 degreesC). Life tables were also constructed for 25, 30, 35, and 25-35 degreesC. The mortality was lower and the mean generation time was shorter at 30 degreesC than at all other temperatures except 35 degreesC. The intrinsic rate of increase was the highest at 30 degreesC (0.081), followed by 0.076 at 25-35 degreesC. The net reproductive rate was higher at 25-35 degreesC than at 30 degreesC. From biological data and population growth parameters calculated from the life tables, 30 degreesC and 25-35 degreesC were determined to be the most suitable temperatures for mass rearing of Nephus includens. However, mass rearing at a temperature as high as 35 degreesC could cause deterioration of sprouted potatoes on which the citrus mealybug is reared. Therefore, 30 degreesC would be better than 25-35 degreesC.									9	1	0	0	11	0	12			1523-5475			WOS:000172937700005

Relative abundance is determined by physiological date of first detection and air temperatures the previous winter. Date of first detection of flies does not determine date of fruit infestation. The level of fruit infestation is determined by year, fly pressure, and insecticide application frequency. Frequency of insecticide application is determined by production system. Non-crop wild fruit and predation influences fly pressure; increased wild fruit abundance results in increased fly pressure. Increased predation rate reduces fly pressure, but only at high abundance of flies, or when high levels of wild fruit are present along field edges. Male sex ratio might be declining over the seven years. Action thresholds were developed from samples of 92 fields from 2012-2017 that related cumulative adult male trap capture to the following week likelihood of fruit infestation. A two-parameter gamma density function describing this probability was used to develop a risk-based gradient action threshold system. The action thresholds were validated from 2016-2018 in 35 fields and were shown to work well in two of three years (2016 and 2017).									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			2075-4450			WOS:000478764600012	31337036

The majority of the population was captured, and a sample (4 females; 3 males) was radio-tracked. Radio-collared mongooses were usually (86 % of time) involved in the same kind oi activity as uncollared ones. Mongooses spent most of the day (37% of radiolocations) foraging: Time of start and cessation of activity was correlated to sunset and sunrise times, minimum and maximum temperature, windspeed, and meteorological conditions (mist, rain, cloudiness). The availability of insects may be a factor underlying this relation. This can explain the differences in activity rhythms among previous studies. Total size of home range (minimum convex polygon) used each day, percentage of total home range used each day, and total daily movements were not related to any of the above variables.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0044-3468			WOS:A1993MC89400004

Identified prey came from six insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera), with Coleoptera making up 59.7%. Mating occurred in the tail-to-tail position and oviposition was in the ground, typically in the shade of vegetation. This species exhibited a distinct daily rhythm of activity for feeding, mating, and oviposition. Grooming behavior resembled that described for other species of Asilidae.

J	Riessen, Howard P.								Water temperature alters predation risk and the adaptive landscape of induced defenses in plankton communities								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				60	6			2037	2047		10.1002/lno.10150				NOV 2015	2015	Water temperature influences many biological processes in zooplankton, including those that affect interactions with predators. These relationships help shape the impact of predation and the development of prey defenses. Many freshwater zooplankton develop induced morphological defenses in response to the presence of various invertebrate predators, a phenomenon that often has a seasonal pattern (cyclomorphosis) in which defenses are enhanced during summer when temperatures are highest. Here, I examine this relationship of water temperature to predation risk and the development of induced defenses by developing a life history model for the common pond-dwelling water flea, Daphnia pulex and its response to predation by larvae of the phantom midge, Chaoborus, which involves the induction of defensive neck spines in the presence of predator kairomones. The model analyzes the influence of water temperature on Daphnia instar development time and body size, and on the encounter rate between Daphnia and Chaoborus, all of which affect the vulnerability of Daphnia to this gape-limited ambush predator. It then assesses the costs and benefits of neck spine development, and thus its fitness consequences, in different temperature environments. Higher water temperatures increase predation risk for Daphnia, resulting in greater fitness advantages in producing induced defenses, but only at relatively high predator densities. This effect is greater at higher levels of food resources for the prey. These results demonstrate the importance of water temperature in influencing predation in plankton communities and help explain the phenomenon of cyclomorphosis in zooplankton, in which induced morphological defenses are limited to summer.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000363888400013

A significant effect of temperature and parasitism density was observed. At 10 degrees C, there was no parasitism, whilst at 40 degrees C it was very low; presenting adequate values at the two other temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C). With regard to these facts, the functional responses of this parasitoid species were adjusted and we noted that they display Holling type III. Estimating the handling times from the respective mathematical expressions, we obtained 10.944 and 15.250 min, at 20 and 30 degrees C, respectively. These values are considerably higher than the respective times obtained by direct observation, 0.597 and 0.560 min for these temperatures (this difference is due to the fact that in the first case, unlike the second one, the time used for the search of the host is also included). The results obtained from the parasitization behaviour of Ch. oculator are discussed, also considering it as a candidate biological control agent against Spdoptera exigua (Hubner), beet armyworm, with a view to its possible use in greenhouse crops in Spain.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			1585-8553	1588-2756		WOS:000258174100006

This problem should be especially acute in aerial predators such as common poorwills (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii: Caprimulgidae), which capture small insects at night. The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that poorwills are constrained to catching larger insect taxa due to limitations of visual orientation under low light. We assessed diet by analysing poorwill faecal samples collected at nest and roost sites in the Cypress Hills of Saskatchewan where prey density is relatively low. Coleopterans (44% and 39% in 1991 and 1992, respectively) and lepidopterans (46% and 55%) dominated the diet, yet these two insect orders were rare in light-suction trap (22% lepidopterans and 1% coleopterans) and sticky trap samples (11% lepidopterans and 2% coleopterans). Based on measurements of femur length, all consumed coleopterans were > 5 mm long, even though 57% of those available were < 5 mm. Our results suggest that poorwills are constrained to taking prey above a certain size, but above this threshold, particular prey types and larger sizes may be selected. Selection for coleopterans may reflect the need to acquire polyunsaturated fat to facilitate the use of torpor.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:A1995QH69400001

Pumpkinseed populations exhibit more 'opportunistic' traits (earlier maturity, smaller size at maturity, and higher reproductive allocation) in their introduced European range than those in their native range. Predictions of life-history traits were improved when indicators of juvenile growth rate (mean length at age 2), waterbody size (surface area), and thermal regime (air temperature degree-days above 10 A degrees C) were incorporated into models along with continental location, but European pumpkinseed populations exhibit more opportunistic life-history traits than North American populations even when these factors are accounted for. Native pumpkinseed in waterbodies containing piscivores mature later and at a larger size, and have lower gonadosomatic indices than those in waterbodies lacking piscivores, whereas there is no significant difference in the same three life-history traits between European waterbodies containing or lacking piscivores. Because congeneric competitors of the pumpkinseed are absent from Europe, the apparent absence of a predator life-history effect there could also be due to the absence of the major sunfish competitors. In either case, the evolution and maintenance of more opportunistic traits in European pumpkinseed can likely be attributed to enemy release, and this may explain the successful establishment and spread of pumpkinseed in many parts of Europe.									30	0	0	0	29	0	30			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000330734100011	24065557

Estimates of absolute population density obtained from two 20-min removal samples taken from each of six 5- by 5-m sub-plots per plot proved reliable and were used to convert estimates obtained from sweepnet sampling (180 sweeps per plot) and visual counts (36 min per plot walking at 10 m/min) into absolute estimates of population density. Population density estimates obtained by removal sampling were quite precise except for species with low capture efficiencies and low population densities.Crop plant growth stage influenced the numbers of beetles caught in sweepnet samples and was incorporated in regression models for converting sweepnet catch to absolute density. Values of R2 of regressions ranged from 0.51 to 0.90, depending on species. Visual counts were influenced by temperature and aphid density, and these variables were incorporated in regression models. Values of R2 for regressions relating visual counts to population densities ranged from 0.63 to 0.94, depending on species.									18	0	0	0	20	0	21			0008-347X			WOS:A1991EZ77100002

To better discriminate and understand the intrinsic and environmental correlates of changing aquatic ecosystems, we untangle in present study how the effects of a low-dosed fungicide on daphnids (via different exposure routes) becomes modified by increasing temperature and the presence of a predator.Using a fractional multifactorial test design, the individual growth, reproduction and population growth rate of Daphnia pulex were investigated under exposure to the fungicide pyrimethanil at an environmental relevant concentration - either directly (via the water phase), indirectly (via food), dually (via water and food) or for multiple generations (fungicide treated source population) - at three temperatures and in presence/absence of the predator kairomones of Chaoborus flavicans.Our results clearly illustrate that multiple stress factors can modify the response of an aquatic key species to pollutants. The environmentally relevant exposure of the contaminant via food or the medium is of same importance. Nevertheless, temperature and the presence of a predator are the dominant factors controlling the reproduction of D. pulex. We conclude that sublethal pyrimethanil pollution can disturb the zooplankton community at suboptimal temperature conditions, but the effects will become masked by low temperatures or if chaoborid larvae are present.

FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISPLAY OF MULTIPLE DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS IN EASTERN INDIGO SNAKES (DRYMARCHON COUPERI)								HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY				10	2			559	571						AUG 2015	2015	The ability to display multiple defensive behaviors may increase the chances of an individual avoiding predation. Morphological and physiological condition often influences the display of particular behaviors. Understanding the factors influencing the display of particular behaviors from a suite of potential behaviors can help understand the conditions under which displaying certain suites of defensive behaviors will confer the greatest advantage. Drymarchon couperi (Eastern Indigo Snake) is a large, non-venomous snake that exhibits multiple visual, auditory, olfactory, and physical defensive behaviors. We studied the responses of wild D. couperi to human capture and examined how the number and presence of individual behaviors were related to extrinsic and intrinsic variables using encounters from 84 snakes. Snakes were more likely to flee from the observer at warmer body temperatures and, once captured, exhibited wide variation in defensive behaviors with less costly (i.e., less aggressive) behaviors predominating. Individuals were more likely to display any type of defensive behavior earlier in the field season (i.e., November through January). However, our variables had relatively little influence on the presence of particular defensive behaviors although, for some behaviors, the probability of displaying a behavior increased as the number of other behaviors exhibited increased. Our study shows that D. couperi defensive behavior is quite variable and that the factors contributing variation are unclear. Environmental factors (e.g., distance to retreat site) or individual predispositions may contribute to some of this variation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2151-0733	1931-7603		WOS:000365085900001

Worldwide more than 1.3 billion of people are living off-grid, often in developing regions of high insect biodiversity. In developed countries, dark refuges for wildlife are threatened by ornamental garden lights. Solar powered LEDs (SPLEDs) are cheaply available, dim, and often used to illuminate foot paths, but little is known on their effects on ground living (epigeal) arthropods. We used off-the-shelf garden lamps with a single 'white' LED (colour temperature 7250 K) to experimentally investigate effects on attraction and nocturnal activity of ground beetles (Carabidae). We found two disparate and species-specific effects of SPLEDs. (i) Some nocturnal, phototactic species were not reducing activity under illumination and were strongly attracted to lamps (>20-fold increase in captures compared to dark controls). Such species aggregate in lit areas and SPLEDs may become ecological traps, while the species is drawn from nearby, unlit assemblages. (ii) Other nocturnal species were reducing mobility and activity under illumination without being attracted to light, which may cause fitness reduction in lit areas. Both reactions offer mechanistic explanations on how outdoor illumination can change population densities of specific predatory arthropods, which may have cascading effects on epigeal arthropod assemblages. The technology may thus increase the area of artificial light at night (ALAN) impacting insect biodiversity. Measures are needed to mitigate effects, such as adjustment of light colour temperature and automated switch-offs.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			1752-458X	1752-4598		WOS:000449713000008

ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS				8	5			411	419		10.1007/s11829-014-9328-x				OCT 2014	2014	Plants produce secondary metabolites related to ecologically relevant processes. These compounds include surface secretions such as latex, mucilage and resins that help plants face abiotic and biotic environmental threats such as drought, nutrient deficiency, extreme temperatures and UV radiation, as well as herbivory, pathogenic microorganisms and other natural enemies. We studied the resinous coating found on involucral bracts of Haplopappus platylepis Phil. (Asteraceae). This plant belongs to a speciose genus widely distributed in South America (Lane and Hartman in Am J Bot 83:356, 1996). H. platylepis is characterized by resinous fragrant leaves. In this species, resins cover the involucral bracts as well as young leaves and are also secreted on reproductive stalks in smaller amounts. We carried out chemical analysis and natural history observations in order to identify whether arthropods caught in inflorescence resin differed from the ones freely visiting floral disks. Regarding bracteal adhesive's chemistry, we identified a mixture of diterpenoids and flavonoids; these compounds form a dense surface resin layer, especially over inflorescence's bracts. In relation to associated arthropods, we found a marked difference in the main organisms captured by bracteal resin compared to insects we observed foraging on disk florets; Arthrobracus (Coleoptera: Melyridae) and Linepithema (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) were the predominant insects "trapped in resin'', while Diadasia (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was the most frequent "floral visitor''. We propose that bracteal resin of H. platylepis may function as a selective trap for non-mutualistic insects reaching reproductive structures of this plant and discuss other multiple possible roles for this secretion, including protocarnivory.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1872-8855	1872-8847		WOS:000344733300005		
J	Huryn, AD								River-floodplain linkage determines production dynamics of detritivorous and predacious mayflies (Ephemeroptera) in a sedge-meadow wetland								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				155	3			455	480						OCT 2002	2002	The macroinvertebrate communities of riparian sedge-meadows in Maine (U.S.A.) are unusual, compared to other types of freshwater wetlands, because they are dominated by mayflies during a 1-2 mo period of spring flooding, and because one mayfly species, Siphlonisca aerodromia, is a predator of the other mayflies. The objectives of this study were to determine temporal patterns of production for mayflies inhabiting a sedge meadow along Tomah Stream in sub-boreal Maine, and to identify key factors influencing their production in this wetland. During spring flooding, mayflies contributed 80-86% of the total macroinvertebrate biomass. Leptophlebia cupida and L. johnsoni together contributed approximately 50% of total biomass. Arthroplea bipunctata, Eurylophella cf. prudentalis, Siphlonurus mirus, S. rapidus and S. aerodromia were also important contributors. More than 80% of the growth of Leptophlebia, S. aerodromia and Siphlonurus occurred on the floodplain. These taxa use the stream channel primarily as a nontrophic refuge for the remainder of the year. Depending upon the year, mayfly production ranges from 1.6 to 2.3 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM)/m(2) of mean inundated wetland area over a 44 to 53 d period. When weighted by the length of the boundary between the sedge meadow and stream, this is equivalent to 7.5-14.0 g AFDM/m(2) of stream channel. Estimates of production for similar streams indicate that this is within the range expected for total annual production by macroin-vertebrates in the stream channel. Depending upon year, estimates of prey consumption by S. aerodromia ranged from 36% to essentially all prey production. Water temperature and predation by S. aerodromia appeared to be key factors influencing the temporal patterns of mayfly production in the Tomah Stream wetland. The physical linkage of the stream and floodplain by the natural flow regime, however, is the fundamental factor determining the productivity of this unusual river-floodplain community.									10	0	0	0	12	0	12			0003-9136			WOS:000179384900007

We assessed how changes in mean and standard deviation of sea surface temperature (SST), frequency and magnitude of warm SST extreme climatic events (ECE) influenced the stochastic population growth rate log(lambda(s)) and age structure of a black-browed albatross population. For changes in SST around historical levels observed since 1982, changes in standard deviation had a larger (threefold) and negative impact on log(lambda s) compared to changes in mean. By contrast, the mean had a positive impact on log(lambda s). The historical SST mean was lower than the optimal SST value for which log(lambda s) was maximized. Thus, a larger environmental mean increased the occurrence of SST close to this optimum that buffered the negative effect of ECE. This 'climate safety margin' (i.e. difference between optimal and historical climatic conditions) and the specific shape of the population growth rate response to climate for a species determine how ECE affect the population. For a wider range in SST, both the mean and standard deviation had negative impact on log(lambda s), with changes in the mean having a greater effect than the standard deviation. Furthermore, around SST historical levels increases in either mean or standard deviation of the SST distribution led to a younger population, with potentially important conservation implications for black-browed albatrosses.This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000400921300009	28483873

However, elevational clines in body size in the mountain dusky salamander Desmognathus ocoee (family Plethodontidae) shift from positive at hatching, to negative at metamorphosis to positive again as adults, and so are not consistent with this explanation. The clinal shift from hatching to metamorphosis was investigated by examining the clinal and seasonal feeding patterns of larval salamanders at high and low elevation sites in rockface and woodland habitats. Repeated cohort sampling was also used to examine clinal and seasonal patterns in body size and to estimate average growth rates. Larval growth in both rockface and woodland habitats was tightly correlated with feeding activity. Although temperature was found to vary between high and low elevation sites, the greatest growth occurred in a cold woodland habitat with a high elevation, and the lowest growth occurred in an adjacent rockface habitat. Because this difference in growth cannot be attributed to thermal differences, we conclude that local food resource levels are the predominant source of local differences in growth. These findings, clinal patterns of variation in other predatory salamanders, and experimental analyses in which both food and temperature are orthogonally manipulated, indicate that general models that single out temperature as the principle cause of ectotherm life-history clines should be viewed with caution.									17	0	0	0	18	0	19			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000182607300009

Quantifying through which vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment performed in a glasshouse. Using data on changes in population abundance and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the model on survival, growth and reproduction. Results suggest that clones varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation based on the pure clones. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000471342700010	30801697

Ages ranged from I to VI years; 60.6% of the fish were females, 39.4% males. The chub population appeared to consume a wide range of food items such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, nematodes, insects, fish, macrophytes, plant and animal detritus, whereby zooplankton (69.2%) predominated. Although individuals in the age I group preferred plankton (phytoplankton frequently; zooplankton infrequently), the older specimens (age groups IV, V and VI) behaved mostly as carnivores but also consumed some macrophytes. While there were no significant differences between diet compositions of males and females, seasonal changes were observed in frequency of occurrence, quality and quantity of consumption, and feeding activity. The chub specimens fed most heavily during spring (the pre-spawning period: March, April and May). Highest food volume (13.0 cm(3)) consumed was in May and the lowest in September (2.0 cm(3)) while also being correlated with temperature. All of the food items were found in the digestive tract (82.1% of the specimens examined over all seasons). Highest fullness (84.9%) was reached in autumn and the lowest during summer (79.8%).									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0175-8659			WOS:000297288200010

The tongue skeleton is projected from the body via an elastic-recoil mechanism that decouples muscle contraction from tongue projection, amplifying muscle power tenfold. We tested the hypothesis that the elastic-recoil mechanism also endows tongue projection with low thermal dependence by examining the kinematics and dynamics of tongue projection in Hydromantes platycephalus over a range of body temperatures (2-24 degrees C). We found that H. platycephalus maintained tongue-projection performance over the tested temperature range and that tongue projection showed thermal independence (Q(10) values of 0.94-1.04) of all performance parameters including projection distance, average velocity, and peak instantaneous values of velocity, acceleration, and power. Nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction, in contrast, responded to temperature changes significantly differently than elastic tongue projection; performance parameters of retraction displayed thermal dependence typical of muscle-powered movement (Q(10) values of 1.63-4.97). These results reveal that the elastic-recoil mechanism liberates tongue projection from the effects of temperature on muscle contractile rates. We suggest that relative thermal independence is a general characteristic of elastic-recoil mechanisms and may promote the evolution of these mechanisms in ectothermic animals. J. Exp.

Three factors affecting larval growth and development rates, survivorship and adult size were tested with a natural population of Anopheles quadrimaculatus (Say) in a Michigan pond. Second-instar An. quadrimaculatus (n = 40) were collected from a field population and maintained in floating microcosms. Before larval introductions, microcosms were placed in 2 pond habitats (open water zones and vegetated areas). Experimental treatments in this study included algal clump, algal clump/predator, and predator only. Control treatment microcosms contained An. quadrimaculatus larvae only. The minimum temperature at the water surface was significantly greater in the open water habitat. Laboratory experiments show that food quality and temperature had a significant effect on larval survivorship. Developmental rates, survivorship, and adult size were higher in the algal clump treatment. The results of this study indicate that factors like surface water microclimates and enhanced food resources can be used to predict An. quadrimaculatus larval distribution and success.									22	0	0	0	18	0	22			0046-225X			WOS:000080061800014

To evaluate E. delhiensis as a biocontrol agent in greenhouse, the killing efficiency of this parasitoid by parasitism and host-feeding, were studied. Killing efficiency can be compared by estimation of functional response parameters. Laboratory experiments were performed in controllable conditions to evaluate the functional response of E. delhiensis at eight densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, and 120 third nymphal stage) of Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood on two hosts including; tomato and prickly lettuce. The maximum likelihood estimates from regression logistic analysis revealed type II functional response for two host plants and the type of functional response was not affected by host plant. Roger's model was used to fit the data. The attack rate (a) for E. delhiensis was 0.0286 and 0.0144 per hour on tomato and 0.0434 and 0.0170 per hour on prickly lettuce for parasitism and host feeding, respectively. Furthermore, estimated handling times (T-h) were 0.4911 and 1.4453h on tomato and 0.5713 and 1.5001h on prickly lettuce for parasitism and host feeding, respectively. Based on 95% confidence interval, functional response parameters were significantly different between the host plants solely in parasitism. Results of this study opens new insight in the host parasitoid interactions, subsequently needs further investigation before utilizing it for management and reduction of greenhouse whitefly.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1536-2442	2250-2645		WOS:000402270700025	28423420

Survival after 7 and 14 d at 2 experimental temperatures was analyzed. There was no consistent difference in survival between sympatric versus allopatric populations at both 7 and 14 d. Multivariate analysis indicated a significant population-environment interaction involving population, temperature, and predation. This interaction was only significant in univariate analyses at 14 d, accounting for 29.9% of the random variation in survival. Populations surviving best or worst with the predator at 20 degrees C did not also survive best or worst, respectively with the predator at 24 degrees C. Survival was also unrelated to long-term average temperatures from the collection sites. Net reduction in survival as a result of predation tended to occur earlier at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, net reduction in survival because of T. rutilus predation was statistically undetectable after 7 d, but was significant after 14 d. Populations of A. triseriatus varied considerably in their ability to survive with this predator, and in their survival at the study temperatures, but population cooccurrence with the predator and long-term average temperatures from the collection sites appeared to be unrelated to this variation. Variation among populations is only apparent after a fairly long period of development, and tile pattern of variation is highly dependent on the experimental temperature. Geographic differentiation in survival with this predator seems likely to be a by-product of geographic variation in growth, development, and feeding rates of A. triseriatus, and unlikely to be primarily a product of natural selection by T. rutilus predation in nature.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0046-225X			WOS:A1996UR93900011

However, latitudinal variation in predator avoidance and defense mechanisms has seldom been studied. We studied tadpole antipredator defenses in seven Rana temporaria populations collected along a 1500-km latitudinal gradient across Sweden, along which previous studies have found increasing tadpole growth and development rates. In a laboratory common garden experiment, we measured behavioral and morphological defenses by raising tadpoles in the presence and absence of a predator (Aeshna dragonfly larva) in two temperature treatments. We also estimated tadpole survival in the presence of free-ranging predators and compared predator densities between R. temporaria breeding ponds situated at low and high latitudes. Activity and foraging were generally positively correlated with latitude in the common garden experiment. While all populations responded to predator presence by decreasing activity and foraging, high-latitude populations maintained higher activity levels in the presence of the predator. All populations exhibited defensive morphology in body and tail shape. However, whereas tail depth tended to increase with latitude in the presence of predator, it did not change with latitude in the absence of the predator. Predator presence generally increased larval period and decreased growth rate. In the southern populations, predator presence tended to have a negative effect on metamorphic size, whereas in the northern populations predators had little or a positive effect on size. Latitude of origin had a strong effect on survival in the presence of a free-ranging predator, with high-latitude tadpoles experiencing higher mortality than those from the low latitudes. In the wild, predator densities were significantly lower in high-latitude than in mid-latitude breeding ponds. Although the higher activity level in the northern populations seems to confer a significant survival disadvantage under predation risk, it is probably needed to maintain the high growth and development rates. However, the occurrence of R. temporaria at high latitudes may be facilitated by the lower predator densities in the north.									86	2	0	0	85	1	88			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000256101200022	18543632

We compared amount of sugar in different samples of nectar collected during the day and night and from bagged and nonbagged pitchers. Sugar content was measured in nectar samples from 87 pitchers at 3 h intervals over a 24 h period through the use of a wick-sampling technique and a colorimetric assay. We monitored environmental conditions at the time of nectar collection and correlated them with the amount of sugar/wick. We also measured ten pitcher characteristics and examined their relationship to variations in 24 h sugar amount. Sugar amount was higher at night for both bagged and nonbagged pitchers. During the day nonbagged pitchers had lower sugar amounts than bagged pitchers, perhaps due to removal of nectar by insects. A similar, but less pronounced, difference was observed at night. Relative humidity, air and ground temperature and time of day had little effect on sugar amount. Our data suggest that nectar may crystallize during the day and dissolve when dew forms at night.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			0003-0031			WOS:000088519700011

Feeding is an ecologically relevant task which is controlled by muscle function. Consequently, in ectotherms, muscle function and feeding kinematics can be altered by temperature. This study investigated the effect of decreasing temperature on the feeding kinematics of the northern most labrid in the Western Atlantic. During winter, cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) enter a state of extended torpor in order to conserve energy when water temperatures drop below similar to 10 degrees C. We hypothesized that feeding kinematics would be slower at lower temperatures especially those associated with torpor (<= 10 degrees C). Additionally, we hypothesized that prey type will elicit different feeding behaviors. Feeding events on sandworms and Asian shore crabs were recorded at 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. Fish held at 5 degrees C had slower opening and closing jaw velocities while using more ram than the other temperature treatments. No differences were detected between prey types. For both prey types, the temperature treatment which consistently induced torpor (5 degrees C) slowed oral jaw movements, which likely forced cunner to rely more on ram than suction to capture prey. Torpor temperatures appeared to have less of an effect on feeding than on metabolic rate, steady swimming capabilities and muscle function, suggesting some compensatory mechanisms of feeding musculature in cunner.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000458431500005

These common culicides are Culex pipiens fatigans, Anopheles gambiae grp., Mansonia africana, Culex pipiens pipiens, Aedes (stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes vittatus. They were each fed directly on a local dog naturally infected with Dirofilaria repens to evaluate their refractoriness/susceptibility to dirofilarial infection. In a number of donor-feeding trials, 39.4% Culex pipiens fatigans; 58.9% An gambiae grp.; 60.5% Mansonia africana; 1.8% of Culex pipiens pipiens; 23.4% Ae aegypti and 3.3% of Ae vittatus successfully fed on the microfilaraemic host. Only Aedes aegypti was susceptible to the infection as all 40 (100%) Ae aegypti reaching 10-14 day post-blood meal had infective (L-3) larvae of D. repens. The remaining five species were refractory. The microfilariae in the five non-susceptible mosquitoes were always found trapped in the blood meal in the insects midgut (stomach). These trapped microfilaria were dead by the 2nd day in the insect' s midgut. However, in the susceptible Ae aegypti, the microfilariae were set free from the blood meal in the midgut and within 24 h migrated to the malpighian tubules (MT) of the mosquitoes. All Ae aegypti dissected 5-7 day post-infective blood meal showed the typical quiescent sausage stage (L-2) larvae in the malpighian tubules. At day-10 post-blood meal, relatively active infective (L3) larvae of D. repens were found in the MT; and by day 12-14, highly motile infective larvae had reached the insect's head and proboscis, with infective larvae occasionally oozing out during dissection through the tip of the proboscis. The rate of development of D. repens to infective larvae was faster in mosquitoes infected in July when the environmental temperature was 24.5 degrees C than those infected in November when the temperature was 22-.5 degrees C. The latter were delayed for 4 days. The breeding sources of Ae aegypti, the local vector implicated were also identified. As no particular Vector of this zoonotic filaria has been identified previously in Nigeria, these findings could make any control programme more focussed and easier. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Growth dynamics of large, mobile animals are particularly useful as bio-indicators of environmental change at regional scales. We assembled growth rate data from throughout the West Atlantic for green turtles, Chelonia mydas, which are long-lived, highly migratory, primarily herbivorous mega-consumers that may migrate over hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Our dataset, the largest ever compiled for sea turtles, has 9690 growth increments from 30 sites from Bermuda to Uruguay from 1973 to 2015. Using generalized additive mixed models, we evaluated covariates that could affect growth rates; body size, diet, and year have significant effects on growth. Growth increases in early years until 1999, then declines by 26% to 2015. The temporal (year) effect is of particular interest because two carnivorous species of sea turtles-hawksbills, Eretmochelys imbricata, and loggerheads, Caretta caretta-exhibited similar significant declines in growth rates starting in 1997 in the West Atlantic, based on previous studies. These synchronous declines in productivity among three sea turtle species across a trophic spectrum provide strong evidence that an ecological regime shift (ERS) in the Atlantic is driving growth dynamics. The ERS resulted from a synergy of the 1997/1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-the strongest on record-combined with an unprecedented warming rate over the last two to three decades. Further support is provided by the strong correlations between annualized mean growth rates of green turtles and both sea surface temperatures (SST) in the West Atlantic for years of declining growth rates (r = -.94) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) for all years (r = .74). Granger-causality analysis also supports the latter finding. We discuss multiple stressors that could reinforce and prolong the effect of the ERS. This study demonstrates the importance of region-wide collaborations.									18	0	0	0	18	0	18			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000412322700011	28378354

To be a viable biological control agent this carabid must also be amenable to mass culturing. Manipulation of the substrate ensured that eggs were laid in soil capsules, but deposited in peat, facilitating collection and monitoring. Up to 570 eggs per beetle were laid at 20 degrees C. No cannibalism was exhibited at any stage by this species. Larvae were reared intensively in batches and fed ad libitum on live earthworms, eliminating the need for regular feeding and the removal of decaying food. Rearing experiments were undertaken under a number of different temperature regimes. At constant 20 degrees C it was found that growth was arrested in some 2nd instar larvae for long periods. Co-ordinated changes between 2nd and 3rd instar stages were induced by reduction of the temperature to 14 degrees C between days 24-31 from hatching. The complete life cycle, from newly laid egg to adult beetle, could be reduced to less than 110 days. Mortality was greatest at the late 3rd instar and pre-pupal stages, and possible reasons for this are discussed.									21	0	0	0	23	1	24			0013-8959			WOS:A1994RT75300009

Such effects have been observed in many traits across many species. Despite enormous potential importanceparticularly in an era of rapid climate changeTGP in thermal growth physiology has never been demonstrated for vertebrates. We provide the first evidence for thermal TGP in a vertebrate: given sufficient time, sheepshead minnows adaptively program their offspring for maximal growth at the present temperature. The change in growth over a single generation (c. 30%) exceeds the single-generation rate of adaptive evolution by an order of magnitude. If widespread, transgenerational effects on thermal performance may have important implications on physiology, ecology and contemporary evolution, and may significantly alter the extinction risk posed by changing climate.									185	2	0	0	175	0	187			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000298848200010	22188553

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				285	2			85	92		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00817.x				SEP 2011	2011	In ectotherms, decreasing season length and lower temperature towards higher latitudes often favour higher growth and developmental rates. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms and particularly the hormonal correlates of clinal variation remain unexplored. The growth hormone (GH) plays a crucial role in growth of all vertebrates and high expression of GH is associated with rapid growth in many species. We tested the hypothesis that GH expression is correlated with a latitudinal gradient in growth in Scandinavian Rana temporaria tadpoles. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we measured GH and growth hormone receptor (GHR) expression at two time points from laboratory-raised tadpoles originating from eight populations collected along the latitudinal gradient. To explore latitudinal differences in stress-induced changes in GH expression, we also compared GH expression in tadpoles raised with and without predators. In accordance with previous studies we found a clear latitudinal gradient in growth. There were no latitudinal effects, or predator-induced effects on GH or GHR expression. However, there was some indication for among-population variation in GH expression. The lack of a latitudinal pattern in GH and GHR expression may be due to that the growth promoting effects of GH is dependent on other factors including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF), IGF-binding proteins or prolactin. Further studies on these factors may provide insight on the proximal mechanisms of differences in growth in R. temporaria tadpoles.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000295095000002		
J	Despland, Emma								Ontogenetic shift from aposematism and gregariousness to crypsis in a Romaleid grasshopper								PLOS ONE				15	8					e0237594	10.1371/journal.pone.0237594				AUG 20 2020	2020	Traits of chemically-defended animals can change as an individual grows and matures, and both theoretical and empirical evidence favour a direction of change from crypsis to aposematism. This study examines the suite of traits involved in an unusual opposite shift from aposematism to crypsis in a neotropical toxic-plant-feeding Romaleid grasshopper,Chromacris psittacus(Gerstaecker, 1873). Field surveys, behavioural observations and a rearing experiment compare host plant choice, aggregation, locomotion and thermoregulation between life history stages. Results showed that both nymphs and adults fed exclusively on a narrow range of Solanaceae plants, suggesting that the shift in defensive syndrome is not due to a change in chemical defense. Instead, nymphal aposematism appears linked to aggregation in response to plant-based selection pressures. Slow nymphal development suggests a cost to feeding on toxic plant compounds, and grouping could mitigate this cost. Grouping also increases conspicuousness, and hence can favour warning colourating in chemically-defended insects. The role of diet breadth in aposematism is poorly understood, and these results suggest how constraints imposed by feeding on toxic plants can generate bottom-up selection pressures shaping the adaptive suites of traits of chemically-defended animals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000564315600075	32817631

PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECTION EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY OF THE NETHERLANDS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY (NEV)								77	85						1998	1998	Cattle grazing of old Deschampsia fields increases numbers of Stenobothrus stigmaticus, possibly by improving food quality or accessibility. Experimental feeding with grass from grazed fields, however, does not enlarge grasshopper survival, growth and egg production, as compared to feeding with grass from ungrazed controls. Reduction of predators, more suitable vegetation structure for grasshopper mobility and higher temperature maxima in the egg environment are more likely causes for the increase of S. stigmaticus under the influence of grazing.					9th Meeting of the Experimental and Applied Entomologists9th Meeting of the Experimental and Applied Entomologists	DEC   19, 1997DEC   19, 1997	Netherlands Entomolog Soc (NEV); Koppert Biolog Syst; Boekhandel Kooyker GinsbergNetherlands Entomolog Soc (NEV); Koppert Biolog Syst; Boekhandel Kooyker Ginsberg	ACAD BLDG LEIDEN UNIV, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDSACAD BLDG LEIDEN UNIV, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	1	0	2					90-71912-17-5	WOS:000077659400013

Field data and results from laboratory rearing are combined to describe life cycles and food habits of the mayflies Paraleptophlebia gregalis and Ameletus n. sp., and the stoneflies Soyedina interrupta, Ostrocerca foersteri, Sweltsa fidelis and Calliperla luctuosa.2. P. gregalis, A. n. sp., S. interrupta and O. foersteri have univoltine life cycles which are characterized by a high degree of plasticity. S. fidelis and C. luctuosa have semivoltine life cycles which are more tightly synchronized.3. Laboratory feeding trials and field observations characterize P. gregalis as a collector, A. n. sp. as a scraper, O. foersteri and S. interrupta as shredders and C. luctuosa as a predator mainly of midge larvae. Late-instar larvae of S. fidelis are believed to be scavengers.4. Laboratory rearing yielded a negative correlation between growth rates (Y) and larval size in autumn (X) for S. interrupta. This indicates compensatory growth by small larvae in order to achieve synchronized emergence. The correlation can be described by the equation:Y = 0.0053-0.0036X (R(2) = 0.82; P < 0.01; n = 22)5. The field and laboratory data indicate that photoperiod mainly determines the rate of development and size of emerging subimagos in P. gregalis.									52	0	0	0	50	1	55			0046-5070			WOS:A1995RP65400006

Larval rearing experiments to determine the effects of temperature and diet on the growth and survival of D.orbita larvae under laboratory conditions comprised five different unicellular algal diets of two brown algal species; Isochysis galbana and Chaetoceros muelleri, two green algae; Tetraselmis seucica and Nannochloropsis oculata, and a mixture of all four strains for larvae maintained at 16 and 22 degrees C. Absolute growth, specific growth rate (SGR) and survival were determined regularly. Larvae reared at 22 degrees C on a mixed diet, or brown algae, performed significantly better than those reared on green algal diets alone. Preliminary trials with settlement cues were undertaken on different aged larvae to determine when larvae become competent. An array of natural cues (carrion, Xenostrobus pulex, adult mucus and Ulvella lens), as well as concentrations of KCl was tested. KCl(concentration of 20mM) induced the greatest settlement, however, no larvae metamorphosed under the conditions provided. This study confirms long-lived planktotrophic larval development for Dicathais orbita with higher development rates at the higher water temperatures. Further studies will optimize culture conditions and cues for settlement and metamorphosis.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000353970800017

In this study, we used a laboratory experiment, a field enclosure experiment, and an analysis of natural community data to demonstrate how Gammarus fossarum affects the species composition of benthic communities by imposing survival selection on its prey. Our laboratory single-prey experiment brought a clear evidence that tube-less chironomids are vulnerable prey and that the predation rate on the tube-dwelling chironomids decreases with increasing tube toughness (from the soft tubes made of detritus to the hard tubes made of sand or calcium carbonate grains). We found that the introduction of G. fossarum to field enclosures significantly changed the species composition of a macroinvertebrate community at an experimental spring fen site. The soft-bodied, slow moving, and tube-less taxa were depleted the most. It appears that the observed patterns were a result of predator's preference rather than encounter rate. Survival selection was detected also in natural communities across a large spatial scale. In accordance with the experiments, high densities of G. fossarum limited the proportion or abundance of vulnerable prey. Our study (1) provides the first convincing evidence that biotic interactions have a structuring effect on the spring fen communities, (2) documents how the predatory effect in a community depends on an interplay between the prey handling behaviour of the predator and species-specific susceptibility of prey, and (3) shows that an omnivorous native amphipod may have a strong impact on aquatic communities despite it is regarded less aggressive than its invasive relatives.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1386-2588	1573-5125		WOS:000516061300002		
J	Bagshaw, Clarence; Isdell, Allen E.; Thiruvaiyaru, Dharma S.; Brisbin, I. Lehr, Jr.; Sanchez, Susan								Molecular detection of canine parvovirus in flies (Diptera) at open and closed canine facilities in the eastern United States								PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE				114	3-4			276	284		10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.02.005				JUN 1 2014	2014	More than thirty years have passed since canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged as a significant pathogen and it continues to pose a severe threat to world canine populations. Published information suggests that flies (Diptera) may play a role in spreading this virus; however, they have not been studied extensively and the degree of their involvement is not known. This investigation was directed toward evaluating the vector capacity of such flies and determining their potential role in the transmission and ecology of CPV. Molecular diagnostic methods were used in this cross-sectional study to detect the presence of CPV in flies trapped at thirty-eight canine facilities. The flies involved were identified as belonging to the house fly (Mucidae), flesh fly (Sarcophagidae) and blow/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) families.A primary surveillance location (PSL) was established at a canine facility in south-central South Carolina, USA, to identify fly virus interaction within the canine facility environment. Flies trapped at this location were pooled monthly and assayed for CPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. These insects were found to be positive for CPV every month from February through the end of November 2011. Fly vector behavior and seasonality were documented and potential environmental risk factors were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the mean numbers of each of the three fly families captured, and after determining fly CPV status (positive or negative), it was determined whether there were significant relationships between numbers of flies captured, seasonal numbers of CPV cases, temperature and rainfall.Flies were also sampled at thirty-seven additional canine facility surveillance locations (ASL) and at four non-canine animal industry locations serving as negative field controls. Canine facility risk factors were identified and evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on the number of CPV cases reported within the past year to determine the correlation of fly CPV status (positive or negative) for each facility, facility design (open or closed), mean number of dogs present monthly and number of flies captured. Significant differences occurred between fly CPV positive vs. negative sites with regard to their CPV case numbers, fly numbers captured, and number of dogs present. At the ASL, a statistically significant relationship was found between PCR-determined fly CPV status (positive or negative) and facility design (open vs. closed). Open-facility designs were likely to have more CPV outbreaks and more likely to have flies testing positive for CPV DNA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	TOCQUE, K; TINSLEY, R; LAMB, T								ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON FEEDING AND GROWTH OF SCAPHIOPUS-COUCHII								HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL				5	3			257	265						JUL 1995	1995	The ecology of the desert toad, Scaphiopus couchii, is very precisely regulated by summer rainfall, such that emergence may be less than 20 nights/year. There are estimates in the literature that, at best, S. couchii can obtain its entire annual energy requirement from a single, very large meal, comprising of 50% its body weight in lipid-rich termites. However, our field data from the San Simon Valley in southeast Arizona, show that the toads are generalist feeders, taking prey groups which appear in sequence during the short summer season, including a remarkable range of noxious animals (solpugids, scorpions, centipedes and pogonomyrmid ants). Alate termites emerged briefly after the first rains and seldom represented a major component of the diet. On the other hand, beetles and other hard-bodied insects formed a consistent food type throughout the season. Alate termites represented around 24% of the total food items ingested by S. couchii and when prey size (length) was taken into account their contribution to the annual intake was around 20%. Beetles, on the other hand, contributed (by size) around 33% to intake, with ants representing around 19% and all other items each representing less than 8%. Differences in prey type, total food ingested and temperature all significantly influenced the weight change of individual toads fed under controlled laboratory conditions. Animals which were fed more frequently grew more rapidly, since weight increases were correlated with food intake. However, for any given intake, increases in weight were significantly lower at high environmental temperatures (31-33 degrees C compared with 20-24 degrees C), presumably due to increasing metabolic demands with temperature. The nutritional quality of the food significantly influenced body weight change and fat body accumulation: toads amassed excessively large fat bodies (representing up to 14% body weight) when fed with lipid-rich mealworms, compared with those fed crickets (fat bodies up to 10% body weight), and toads fed woodlice had virtually no fat bodies after eating an equivalent number of meals. These studies show that the natural prey range of S. couchii varies in time and space, and when toads consume high energy foods, weight increase and fat deposition are very efficient. However, the frequent ingestion of other foodstuffs, lower in calorific value, suggests that a greater number of meals are necessary to accumulate the total annual energy requirement. These other prey items may provide essential nutrients that are lacking from lipid-rich foods.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0268-0130			WOS:A1995RK05200004

A total of 47 specimens were collected during one year and identified as: Chrysoperla externa (Hagen, 1861), Leucochrysa (Nodita) intermedia (Scheneir, 1851) and Leucochrysa (Nodita) vieirana (Navás, 1913). The captures in the area where the plants were one year old represented about 75% of the adults probably due to the high Cinara infestation on the trees in this area. The chrysopids were recorded mostly during the summer, possibly influenced by temperature.									4	0	0	0	3	4	5			1806-9665			SCIELO:S0085-56262003000300019

Life history, life table and functional response of A. exotica were determined using the cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch, 1854 as prey under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity and light. The average recorded duration of A. exotica development was 2.0, 7.4 and 5.7 days for eggs, larvae and pupae respectively, and 15.04 days from egg to adult emergence. The adult longevity was not significantly sex dependent, but imagoes lived longer than in previous studies. The offspring sex ratio was favorable to males. The mortality and survival rate were recorded on a daily basis for all immature stages and adults. The age specific survival rate was determined and the highest mortality occurred in eggs followed by mortality in 1st and 2nd instar larva. Moreover, in the present study different levels of aphid densities 10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 100 were used to calculate the functional response. Based on logistic regression analyses the three instar larvae and the whole larval stage (first to third instar) exhibited a type II functional response. Handling time was shortest for the third larval instar followed by second and first instars. Potential use of A. exotica in augmentative biological control is discussed.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000415670600009		
J	BEAMESDERFER, RC								REPRODUCTION AND EARLY LIFE-HISTORY OF NORTHERN SQUAWFISH, PTYCHOCHEILUS-OREGONENSIS, IN IDAHO ST-JOE RIVER								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				35	3			231	241		10.1007/BF00001888				NOV 1992	1992	Reproduction and early life history of northern squawfish, Ptychocheilus oregonensis, was investigated in Idaho's St. Joe River from 1980-1981. Spawning occurs in large aggregations which mill near the substrate to broadcast eggs and milt. Males greatly outnumber females in the aggregations. Males mature at smaller sizes and younger ages, and exhibit slower growth and greater mortality than females, although females devote more resources than males to gonadal production. Spawning was observed in June and July at temperatures of 12 to 18-degrees-C and was restricted to sites with the unique combination of a gravel-cobble substrate free of sand and a bottom velocity of 0.4 m s-1 or less. Juvenile northern squawfish schooled with other young cyprinids in sandy, zero-velocity, shallow-water margins of the river. Age 1 northern squawfish used deeper and more diverse microhabitats than juveniles. Growth of juveniles was rapid and variable during the first summer. During winter, average length did not increase and condition declined. Young northern squawfish ate a wide variety of crustaceans, aquatic insects, and terrestrial insects although individual fish tended to focus on one or two items. Diet breadth and food volume increased with age except in winter.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0378-1909			WOS:A1992JW38300002

Over the 2015 season, a total of 240 individuals were uniquely marked at this site; 73 were re-sighted at least one more time. The overall emergence window for this population in 2015 spanned 47 days with a maximum individual lifespan observed of 23 days; adult seasonal phenology periods for three other years are also summarized from presence/absence observations. In 2015, the adult sex ratio was slightly male-skewed (58%), but there was no significant difference between the sexes in home range size or perch distance from water. Flies packed more tightly into microhabitat patches as the overall abundance increased, and individuals showed some fidelity to relatively small home ranges (the median area of activity for marked individuals was 20 m(2)). However, longer dispersal also occurred rarely-the farthest movement we observed was 726 m over nine days. Individuals were active from morning to evening (usually 10:00 to 18:00) with a daily activity period that appeared to depend on both light intensity and temperature. Prey consisted mostly of Empididae, but also included Simuliidae, Anthomyiidae, and Cicadellidae. Both males and females were observed mating with multiple partners on different days.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000498842800006

Knowledge of how this will affect biological systems is still largely restricted to the lower levels of organization (e.g. species range shifts), rather than at the community, food web or ecosystem level, where responses cannot be predicted from studying single species in isolation. Further, many correlational studies are confounded with time and/or space, whereas experiments have been mostly confined to laboratory microcosms that cannot capture the true complexity of natural ecosystems. We used a 'natural experiment' in an attempt to circumvent these shortcomings, by characterizing community structure and trophic interactions in 15 geothermal Icelandic streams ranging in temperature from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C. Even modest temperature increases had dramatic effects across multiple levels of organization, from changes in the mean body size of the top predators, to unimodal responses of species populations, turnover in community composition, and lengthening of food chains. Our results reveal that the rates of warming predicted for the next century have serious implications for the structure and functioning of these fragile 'sentinel' ecosystems across multiple levels of organization.									79	2	0	0	71	0	81			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000278308100007

ECOLOGY				98	9			2301	2311		10.1002/ecy.1941				SEP 2017	2017	Climate change may cause changes in the dynamics of populations beyond comparatively simple directional effects. To better understand complex effects on dynamics requires long-term studies of populations that experience changes in climatic conditions. We study the dynamics of a seed-production-seed-predation system, consisting of a perennial herb and its two seed predatory insects, over a 40-yr period during which climate change has caused the annual growing season to increase by 20 d. During this period, plant patches have increased almost threefold in size and seed production has slipped into a pattern of alternate high and low years with a higher variance than in the beginning of the period. We find that seed production is associated with precipitation of the present summer and a non-linear feedback from seed production of the previous year. When previous year's seed production is low, weather forcing and unexplained noise determine the extent of seed production. When previous seed production is high, depleted resources limit seed production. Resource depletion happened frequently in the latter parts of the study but rarely in the beginning. The changing patterns of seed production in turn affect the dynamics of seed predation, which is dominated by one of the seed predators. Its dynamics are strongly linked to seed density fluctuations, but its population growth rate is satiated when resource fluctuations become too large. In the latter part of the study period, when seed fluctuations were alternating between years of high and low density, satiation was common and there was a large increase in surviving seeds in good years. Our study illustrates that a changing climate can fundamentally influence patterns of long-term dynamics at multiple trophic levels.									6	0	0	0	7	0	7			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000408836600009	28703294

Several organisms have been studied both in lab and in the field so as to find out their capacity to devour mosquito larvae. High densities of Macrobrachium tenellum are found in natural conditions, it is not aggressive and may stand wide ranges of temperature, rates of salinity and oxygen concentrations. Objective: to evaluate the predatory capacity of Macrobrachium tenellum on Aedes aegypti larvae in lab conditions. Methods: very young Macrobrachium tenellum prawns measuring A(3.0-3.5cm) and B(4.5-5 cm) were used. The mosquito larvae were obtained after hatching of egss from adult females kept in entomological cages. Five, ten, fifteen and twenty Aedes aegypti larvae were placed per treatment per rank, whereas the second bioassays adjusted the number of larvae to 30, 40, 50 and 80 larvae per treatment per rank. Results: Macrobrachium tenellum showed high rate of larval consumption for the two ranks and treatments. In the highest density (80 larvae), the consumption was 95% of larvae at 24 hours for rank A and 100% for rank B. Conclusions: Macrobrachium tenellum may be considered as a potential biological control agent, due to its abundant presence in natural conditions, its resistance to different environmental conditions and to its voraciousness seen in this study.	Introducción: en los últimos años se le ha dado gran importancia a los depredadores naturales de Aedes aegypti. Se han investigado, tanto en el campo como en el laboratorio, los distintos organismos con capacidad de devorar larvas de este mosquito. Macrobrachium tenellum se encuentra en altas densidades en condiciones naturales, no es agresivo y puede tolerar un amplio y fluctuante intervalo de temperaturas, salinidades y concentraciones de oxígeno. Objetivo: evaluar la capacidad depredadora de Macrobrachium tenellum sobre larvas de Aedes aegypti en condiciones de laboratorio. Métodos: se utilizaron juveniles de Macrobrachium tenellum con dos rangos de tallas: A (3,0 cm-3,5 cm) y B (4,5 cm-5,0 cm). Las larvas del mosquito se obtuvieron de la eclosión de huevos producidos por hembras adultas mantenidas en una jaula entomológica. En el primer bioensayo se colocaron 5, 10, 15 y 20 larvas de Aedes aegypti por tratamiento por rango. En el segundo bioensayo el número de larvas se ajustó a 30, 40, 50 y 80 larvas por tratamiento por rango. Resultados: Macrobrachium tenellum demostró un alto consumo de larvas para los dos rangos y tratamientos. En la mayor densidad (80 larvas) se obtuvo el consumo de 95 % de larvas a las 24 h para el rango A y 100 % para el rango B. Conclusión: Macrobrachium tenellum puede ser considerado como un potencial agente de control biológico debido a su abundancia en ambientes naturales, su resistencia a diversas condiciones ambientales y a la voracidad presentada en este estudio.								0	0	0	0	0	1	1			1561-3054			SCIELO:S0375-07602012000300011	23424807

A mechanistic framework could better predict these different temperature-disease outcomes. However, such a framework remains challenging to develop, due to the nonlinear and (sometimes) opposing thermal responses of different host and parasite traits and due to the difficulty of validating model predictions with observations and experiments. We address these challenges in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) system. We test the hypothesis that warmer temperatures promote disease spread and produce larger epidemics. In lakes, epidemics that start earlier and warmer in autumn grow much larger. In a mesocosm experiment, warmer temperatures produced larger epidemics. A mechanistic model parameterized with trait assays revealed that this pattern arose primarily from the temperature dependence of transmission rate (), governed by the increasing foraging (and, hence, parasite exposure) rate of hosts (f). In the trait assays, parasite production seemed sufficiently responsive to shape epidemics as well; however, this trait proved too thermally insensitive in the mesocosm experiment and lake survey to matter much. Thus, in warmer environments, increased foraging of hosts raised transmission rate, yielding bigger epidemics through a potentially general, exposure-based mechanism for ectotherms. This mechanistic approach highlights how a trait-based framework will enhance predictive insight into responses of infectious disease to a warmer world.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000428287200004	29570399

Comparisons between seasons (active, inactive) and among three environments (pine, eucalypt, unmodified), were made using rarefaction analyses, importance indices, and nonparametric tests. Elachistocleis bicolor has a specialized diet composed mainly of Pheidole and Solenopsis ants and termites. The diet of E. bicolor includes a high number of prey per individual, suggesting active search as a foraging strategy. The consumption of myrmicine ants (i.e., Solenopsis) represents a source for potential toxic skin secretions that in E. bicolor may be used to avoid being attacked in the ant nests used for shelter during aestivation, as occurs in the microhylid Phrynomantis microps. Diets in forested environments were richer in both periods, which may reflect the colonization of opportunistic ant species in these environments. Ants were more important in the eucalyptus plantations, particularly in the inactive period, whereas termites were more important in the pine plantations mainly in the inactive period. These environmental and seasonal differences in diet are consistent with the temperature and humidity tolerances of ants and termites, which are the! main prey of E. bicolor.									16	0	0	0	14	6	19			0289-0003			WOS:000246994800003	17551242	
J	Ziesche, T.; Roth, A.								Is the age of forest habitats affecting the reproductive rate of generalist predatory ground beetle species?								COMMUNITY ECOLOGY				8	2			183	194		10.1556/ComEc.8.2007.2.5				2007	2007	This study aimed at the effects of habitat age on the reproductive rate of three ground beetle species that arc common and widely distributed in forest ecosystems of Europe (Abax parallelepipedus (Pill. & Mitt.), Pterostichus oblongopunctatus (F.), Pterostichus burmeisteri (Heer.)). The study sites comprised comparable age classes, i.e.., young stands, mature stands, and mature forests with upcoming and established natural regeneration of four different forest types, namely pure stands of spruce and Douglas fir, and mixed stands of spruce-beech and oak-beech. As an indicator for the reproductive rate of female beetles, the number of ripe eggs in the ovaries and the duration of the reproduction period were investigated from captures of pitfall trapping (n = 8 per site). The dissection of a total of 1236 females uncovered 1704 eggs. A broad spectrum of environmental factors including microclimate (temperature, humidity, precipitation), soil parameters (moisture, pH, thickness and coverage of litter layer) and vegetation characteristics (coverage of moss, herb, grass, shrub and natural regeneration, degree of canopy closure) was assessed to reveal the relevant factors influencing the reproductive success.Within the forest types, the egg-load of the ground beetle species showed statistically significant relations to the age of the stand type. For A. parallelepipedus, a quite uniform reaction pattern was evident with significantly higher egg-loads in the mature forests compared to the young stands. This was accompanied by a longer duration of the reproduction period. A stronger influence of the forest type was obvious for the egg-load of Pt. oblongopunctatus and Pt. burmeisteri. The reproductive rate was generally increasing with temperature aspects in forest sites and was significantly influenced by moisture parameters. The mean maximum temperature of the habitat cared for most of the variation in A. parallelepipedus (61.4%), while the mean minimum temperature explained 60.7% of the reproductive potential in Pt. oblongopunctatus. The variation of Pt. burmeisteri was best explained by the humidity of the air (49.4%). Thus, the results of our study emphasize the role of abiotic parameters on the reproductive rate of ground beetles.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1585-8553			WOS:000251928400005		
J	Peck, Lloyd S.; Brockington, Simon								Growth of the Antarctic octocoral Primnoella scotiae and predation by the anemone Dactylanthus antarcticus								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY				92		SI		73	78		10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.01.024				AUG 2013	2013	Growth rates in Antarctic marine ectotherms have been demonstrated to be slowed by two to five times compared to shallow-water temperate species, with no previous reports for octocorals. Here growth rates were estimated in the single axis, non-branching Antarctic octocoral Primnoella scotiae using repeated in situ length measures covering both summer and winter periods, for tagged colonies from three sites at Signy Island over a two year period. Mean rates of length increase at the different sites ranged from 0.96 mm yr(-1) to 55.3 mm yr(-1). The fastest individual colony growth rate at any site ranged from 2.55 mm yr(-1) to 175.6 mm yr(-1). The mean of the fastest growth rates across all sites was 33.0 mm yr(-1) +/- 14.7 (s.e.). Growth was significantly different between sites, and also between seasons and years. The mean overall increase in diameter of the average sized colony in the study (222.5 mm in axis length) was 0.053 mm yr(-1). This is the slowest reported growth rate of any octocoral to date, and is five times slower than growth in most cold water octocorals. During the study it was noted that colonies were being attacked and consumed by the anemone Dactylanthus antarcticus. At one of the sites studied, between 5% and 8% of colonies surveyed were attacked each month. Anemone dispersal was via whole body inflation and drifting to new prey colonies that were attached to using tentacle-like column protuberances. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This species appeared in Slovakia probably after the first Rhine-Main-Danube canal was built. Because little is known about its ecology, the aim of our study was to analyze the life cycle, individual growth rate, reproduction parameters and food composition of D. punctata in the Vydrica Stream. Samples of leeches were taken mainly each month from April 2003 to November 2004. The leech D. punctata had maximal 2-year life cycle there. Mature leeches, which were recognized by the presence of clitella, were present from April to the end of August. The most individuals mature at the age of 1 year. The breeding season of D. punctata peaks in June. The number of eggs per one cocoon is from 3 to 12. The mean successfulness of development of egg to embryo is 58%. Larvae from the family Chironomidae (28%), Gammarus fossarum (20%) and oligochaetes from the subfamily Naidinae (17%) are the dominant components of the feeding niche.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1434-2944	1522-2632		WOS:000288099500004

Fifty-three specimens were captured during spring and summer in four locations in Patagonia, Argentina. The stomach contents of the specimens were identified, and we found that prey consisted of six main groups: Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Homoptera and Araneae, and the adults and larvae of moth Lepidoptera. Lepidoptera was the major dietary component. The presence of ants and moths as common prey suggests an ambush feeding strategy. In spring, females consumed more ants than males although no other dietary differences between males and females were evident. We found nine geckos with empty stomachs and six parasitized by nematodes. Presence of empty stomachs corroborates previous observations of other nocturnal geckos and non-gecko lizards. Reduced foraging success of nocturnal lizards could be due to difficulty in prey detection due to dim light, reduced or erratic activity of insect prey at night, or shorter activity times of geckos relative to diurnal success. Sex and season were not associated with the incidence of empty stomachs. Principal component analysis showed that four food alternatives correlated with season. The constraint of nocturnality, coupled with low night-time temperatures restricting feeding to only a few hours after sunset, appear to have caused a generality of diet which may limit energy acquisition. We conclude that H. darwini is an arthropod generalist and likely an ambush forager, as are many other nocturnal gekkonids [Current Zoology 56 (4): 406-410, 2010].									6	0	0	0	6	2	7			1674-5507			WOS:000279399300004		
J	Ronnas, Cecilia; Dalin, Peter								Evergreen foliage allows early hatching in a pine processionary moth and escape from predation								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				39	4			445	452		10.1111/een.12117				AUG 2014	2014	1. Seasonal variation in leaf quality and climate conditions often imposes constraints on the temporal occurrence of tree-feeding insect larvae, but the seasonal effects of predation have received limited attention. In temperate climate zones, both the abundance and activity of predators can be expected to vary over time,2. The study reported herein examined the impact of temporal variation in predator activity levels on the life history of an herbivorous insect feeding on a constant food source: previous-year needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). In field experiments, the survival and growth rates of colonies of Thaumetopoea pinivora Treitschke larvae that had been manipulated to hatch at three different dates were compared. Eggs of T. pinivora usually hatch by mid-April in southern Sweden, which is earlier than most other herbivorous insects that overwinter as eggs in this region.3. Predator exclusion experiments indicated that larvae which hatched later than April experienced a higher level of predator activity, mainly by ants. The final larval size and the timing of pupation were not affected by hatching date. First instar larvae were more extensively preyed On than second instars.4. The life history of herbivore species can be affected by seasonal variation in predation pressures. This study suggests that early hatching in a lepidopteran species can allow a temporal escape from predation during the vulnerable early life stages.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:000340662000006

However, little is known about the diet of predators undergoing torpor or whether differences in prey composition among individuals influence torpor characteristics. Here, we test the hypothesis that prey composition affects winter torpor use and patterns of a population of carnivorous marsupial, the brush-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus blythi), in the Great Sandy Desert, Australia. Mulgaras in the study population captured a wide range of prey including vertebrates (mammals, reptiles, birds), seven insect orders, spiders and centipedes. The proportion of vertebrates in the diet was negatively correlated with both frequency of torpor use and maximum bout duration. This variation in torpor use with diet can be explained by the higher energetic content of vertebrates as well as their larger size. Even assuming uniform intake of prey biomass among individuals, those that subsisted on an invertebrate-dominated diet during winter apparently suffered energetic shortages as a result of the scarcity of invertebrate taxa with high energy content (such as insect larvae). Our study is the first to demonstrate a link between diet composition and daily torpor use in a free-ranging mammal.									23	0	0	0	22	0	23			0028-1042			WOS:000266093000002	19238345

Mean individual body size should therefore decline, which also implies a loss of biomass at higher trophic levels. If resources are plentiful and easily assimilated, however, the required to persist in warmer environments may be attained, leading to faster growth rates and an overall increase in the biomass of apex predators. Here, we investigated the response of different trophic groups to increasing temperature in a system of geothermal streams in Iceland, exposed to a temperature gradient of 5-21 degrees C. These streams provide an ideal natural experiment for isolating the effects of warming in multispecies systems, as they have broadly similar geographical and physicochemical features. The macrophyte cover increased significantly with increasing stream temperature, suggesting a greater resource pool for macroinvertebrates (either through direct grazing or feeding on epiphytes). This was reflected by a greater number of generations in 1 year among macroinvertebrates: species in the coldest streams were either uni- or bivoltine, while those in the warmer streams were mostly bivoltine or multivoltine. Differences in phenology were also seen among streams, with emergence of adults limited mostly to the summer months in the colder streams, but occurring year-round in the warmer streams. Macroinvertebrates also grew faster with increasing temperature, contributing to greater population biomass and secondary production in the warmer streams. This increase in prey availability likely produced more favourable conditions for top predators in the warmer streams, leading to an increasing biomass of brown trout with increasing temperature. These findings suggest that warming does not necessarily favour the small in aquatic ecosystems, with high-resource availability, faster reproductive and growth rates and greater production all contributing to meet the high-metabolic demands of apex predators in warmer environments.									26	0	0	0	22	0	27			0065-2504		978-0-12-417210-4; 978-0-12-417199-2	WOS:000326098900006

In this study, we evaluate the potential of the ladybeetle Scymnus nubilus Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) as a biological control agent against Aphis spiraecola Patch and Cinara juniperi (De Geer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) infesting Azorean endemic plants reared in forestry nurseries. RESULTS Aphis spiraecola, infesting Viburnum treleasei Gand. (Dipsacales: Adroxaceae), was the most abundant aphid; however, a higher proportion of Juniperus brevifolia (Seub.) Antoine (Pinales: Cupressaceae) was infested by C. juniperi. Scymnus nubilus fourth instar larvae were able to complete development on both aphid species. Voracity was significantly higher when S. nubilus was fed on A. spiraecola but biomass consumption was significantly lower. The relative growth rate and conversion efficiency of the fourth instar larvae were similar. Field experiments indicated that S. nubilus can contribute to the decrease in pest population densities. However, the fourth instar larvae proved to be more efficient when released onto A. spiraecola; this outcome can be attributed to the distribution patterns of the aphids on the host plant and to the aphid or host plant morphology. Predator density and sleeve cage effect are apparently critical factors in reaching an efficient control. CONCLUSION The obtained results provide the essential preliminary information required to establish future programs of biological control against aphids infesting Azorean endemic plants. Developmental and feeding performances, as well as the immediate impact of the predator when released onto A. spiraecola colonies, indicate that S. nubilus could be a useful candidate for reducing aphid populations.

J	Sandberg, JB; Szczytko, SW								Life cycle of Isoperla lata (Plecoptera : Perlodidae) in a central Wisconsin trout stream								GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST				30	4			143	159						WIN 1997	1997	Monthly qualitative samples of Isoperla lata Frison were made from January 1992 to June 1993 in Ripley Creek, a small second order trout stream in Lincoln County Wisconsin. Additional collecting and an in-stream hatching experiment were conducted in 1994. This species exhibited an S1 (slow) univoltine life cycle. Emergence was synchronous and occurred in late April through early May when stream temperatures in the field were approximately 9-14 degrees C and laboratory stream temperatures were 7-17 degrees C. Laboratory longevity was 2-25 ((x) over bar = 18.2 +/- 4.51) days for males and 7-39 ((x) over bar = 21.7 +/- 5.35) days for females. Mean fecundity of dissected females was 322 +/- 122 eggs/female. Females did not deposit egg masses in the laboratory until being held together with males inside modified screened plastic containers. Field-collected females did not have eggs. The egg shape was ovoid and circular in cross section. Mature eggs were light brown and measured 371.7 +/- 12.6 mm and 260.7 +/- 10.2 mm in length and width respectively. Eggs required a 40-46 day in-stream incubation period and first instar nymphs hatched synchronously over a two day period when stream temperature reached 20 degrees C. Nymphal growth was nearly exponential from June to January and then declined until emergence. The greatest growth increment occurred between June and October and the average maximum size attained occurred in February. Males and females had approximately 18 and 19 instars respectively. Nymphs were primarily carnivorous throughout development and fed on larval Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0090-0222			WOS:000074148300002

Parallel observations were made on laboratory cultures of each life stage. All juvenile stages of L. angusticollis are voracious predators, preying mainly on the herbivorous copepod Boeckella poppei. Adult beetles additionally predate benthic ostracods. Laboratory predation rates and held population densities found in this study suggest that L. angusticollis has a more significant impact on its prey than recognised in recent studies of South Georgian lakes. Spring field samples contained only a few individuals of larval instar IV and adults. Young larvae were present from December onwards, with a rapid progression through juvenile instars during the summer months. Fourth instar larvae left the water for pupation between mid-December and at least mid-February. Combining these observations with known developmental threshold temperatures for each life stage implies that L. angusticollis has a complex biennial (minimum) life-cycle, with overwintering possible in three life stages [aquatic larvae, terrestrial pupae (not proven) and aquatic adults]. L. angusticollis may be a suitable indicator species in the context of climate warming studies: a small (1 degrees C) rise in mean environmental temperatures, comparable to that already observed at several sub-Antarctic and maritime Antarctic localities, would allow completion of an annual (univoltine) life-cycle, with concomitant rapid population increase, and serious implications for trophic interactions in these simple lake ecosystems.									22	0	0	0	23	0	27			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000075784600001

We collected eggs of this species from communal nests from a highland locality in the municipality of La Calera, Cundinamarca, in Colombia. The eggs were incubated in outdoors terrariums, and the growth of the hatchlings was recorded until their death. The growth pattern fits a logistic model, in which individuals grow moderately at the beginning, and then their growth rate increases. The growth rate increases even after individuals reach sexual maturity and seems to decrease close to their maximum body size. It is a fast growing species that reaches sexual maturity at around 50 % of its maximum body size and has a lifespan of less than two years. This strategy could be a consequence of high predation pressures, but it is a hypothesis that needs to be tested in the wild.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1900-1649			WOS:000462045400010		
J	Hofer, R; Medgyesy, N								Growth, reproduction and feeding of dwarf Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, from an Alpine high mountain lake								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				138	4			509	524						FEB 1997	1997	The Arctic char population (Salvelinus alpinus) from a shallow high mountain lake in the Alps (Oberer Plenderlesee, Kuhtai, Tyrol, Austria, 2344 m a.s.l.) was subjected to seasonal studies on growth, reproduction and feeding. Growth rate and condition factors were low, and the life-span was relatively short (up to 10 years). Males matured in their third year, the majority of females one year later, partly with spawning cycles of more than one year. Ovaries started to grow in July and attained a weight of 13.3% in October. Atretic eggs (10-30%) were found in one third of adult females. The relative number of eggs decreased with age and size of the fish. The relative liver weight increased with gonadal development by a factor of 2.5. Compared to low-altitude populations the relative liver weight of female Arctic char from Oberer Plenderlesee is significantly higher, indicating compensation for the low environmental temperature. Fish fed during an seasons; the highest values of stomach contents, however, were found at the period of ice-break and in autumn. In winter, Arctic char fed almost exclusively on chironomid larvae. During the ice-free period, the diet was more complex with a predominance of flying insects.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0003-9136			WOS:A1997WQ50600005

Three main foci were identified in eighty's decade: Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro region, Lisbon region and Algarve region, but according to OnLeish observatory data, canine leishmaniasis cases have been reported from several other regions, for which sand fly species and their infection rates are unknown. This study is the first phlebotomine survey in Torres Novas municipality, Santarem District, Portugal. The main objectives were to identify the phlebotomine species, their bioecological aspects, Leishmania infection rate and the risk factors for the presence of phlebotomine species in the municipality. From June to November, 2010, 275 biotopes were surveyed with CDC light-traps. Captures covered the 17 parishes of the municipality and included domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic biotopes. Specimens were identified morphologically and females were used for molecular detection of Leishmania and bloodmeal identification. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify risk factors for phlebotomine presence. Nonparametric tests were used to compare densities of independent groups. A total of 1262 sand flies were captured and identified, and four species detected: P. perniciosus (73.69%), P. ariasi (8.16%), P. sergenti (6.58%) and Sergentomyia minuta (11.57%). In 71.4% localities at least one L. infantum proven vector species was present. Risk factors were identified as: high average temperatures and low relative humidities, sheltered locations and absence of strong wind, presence of pine trees as dominant vegetation, peridomestic biotopes, particularly sheep pens or proximity of sheep, poultry and house martin nests. L. infantum infection rate was 4% for P. ariasi and 0.48% for the total of Larroussius females. P. perniciosus females exhibited an opportunistic behavior, feeding in a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. The high abundance and distribution of proven vector species, together with a canine leishmaniasis seroprevalence of 7.93% in the District, and the capture of a gravid infective sand fly female, suggests that Torres Novas municipality is a potential zoonotic leishmaniasis focus in the country.

J	Gavilanez-Slone, Jenny; Porter, Sanford D.					Porter, Sanford/0000-0001-5321-5898			COLONY GROWTH OF TWO SPECIES OF SOLENOPSIS FIRE ANTS (HYMENOPTERA: FORMICIDAE) REARED WITH CRICKETS AND BEEF LIVER								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				96	4			1482	1488		10.1653/024.096.0428				DEC 2013	2013	Most diets for rearing fire ants and other ants contain insects such as crickets or mealworms. Unfortunately, insect diets are expensive, especially for large rearing operations, and are not always easily available or uniformly effective. This study was designed to examine colony growth of Solenopsis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) fire ants fed beef liver. Five experiments were performed: four with Solenopsis invicta Buren colonies and one with Solenopsis geminata (F.) colonies. In these experiments, we compared the net growth of colonies fed raw liver, boiled liver-agar, and/or raw liver-agar all with house crickets (Acheta domesticus, (L.); Orthoptera: Gryllidae) as a standard diet. Both liver and house cricket diets produced healthy growing colonies at the end of 6-8 wk. However, colonies fed crickets were 1.7 to 3 times larger than those fed with liver. Raw liver and raw liver-agar diets performed similarly. Boiling the liver significantly reduced colony growth in S. geminata, but liver boiled for as long as 45 min still produced healthy fire ant colonies. This study demonstrates that beef liver is an acceptable diet for rearing laboratory colonies of both S. invicta and S. geminata for periods up to 6 months when maximum growth rates are not needed. However, house crickets are recommended for research studies where maximal growth is important because liver, mealworms, and banded crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus, F. Walker; Orthoptera: Gryllidae) are not as effective. Poor survival of liver-fed colonies after 8 months may indicate that beef liver is not an acceptable long-term diet. Pilot tests with canned liver cat food and a dry dog food showed they were palatable but not suitable for brood production in fire ant colonies.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000329082500028

Estimating Density and Temperature Dependence of Juvenile Vital Rates Using a Hidden Markov Model								INSECTS				8	2					51	10.3390/insects8020051				JUN 2017	2017	Organisms in the wild have cryptic life stages that are sensitive to changing environmental conditions and can be difficult to survey. In this study, I used mark-recapture methods to repeatedly survey Anaea aidea (Nymphalidae) caterpillars in nature, then modeled caterpillar demography as a hidden Markov process to assess if temporal variability in temperature and density influence the survival and growth of A. aidea over time. Individual encounter histories result from the joint likelihood of being alive and observed in a particular stage, and I have included hidden states by separating demography and observations into parallel and independent processes. I constructed a demographic matrix containing the probabilities of all possible fates for each stage, including hidden states, e.g., eggs and pupae. I observed both dead and live caterpillars with high probability. Peak caterpillar abundance attracted multiple predators, and survival of fifth instars declined as per capita predation rate increased through spring. A time lag between predator and prey abundance was likely the cause of improved fifth instar survival estimated at high density. Growth rates showed an increase with temperature, but the preferred model did not include temperature. This work illustrates how state-space models can include unobservable stages and hidden state processes to evaluate how environmental factors influence vital rates of cryptic life stages in the wild.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2075-4450			WOS:000404617800018	28505138

The mean densities of Tachyporus in the hedge were 264 and 410 individuals per m2, respectively.T. hypnorum, which was most numerous, had a significantly higher density in the south edge of the hedge, compared to the northern one. However T. obtusus preferred the middle of the hedge as hibernating site. Annual activity of Tachyporus in the field was studied in 1986 by means of window traps and barrier-traps: The dispersal from the hedge into the field by flight occurred in the period in May with highest daily air temperatures.The earliest activity of adults on the ground surface was recorded from mid April. The periods of highest activity were May/June and September/October. The activity of the larvae was recorded from June to August, while newly emerged adults appeared in July. Activity of adults and tenerals in the edges of the hedge was recorded in September/October.The diurnal activity of the Tachyporus species and their distribution in their crop were studied in June, July, and August 1986 by means of sweep net samples and captures from barrier-pitfalls.The activity of the adults and larvae in the tillers increased shortly after sunset, however, depending on the temperature. A maximum activity of adult Tachyporus was seen between 22h00 and 01h00, whereas no maximum larval activity was recorded.									9	0	1	0	10	0	11			0031-4056			WOS:A1990ET20400003

The mean life cycle of S. tridens was 12.35 days and mean longevity was 57.1 days, with an average of 101.1/female. The life table parameters of S. tridens were: specific fertility came to a maximum of 2.49 eggs; survival probability: 0.92%; net reproduction rate: 53.05 individuals; average generation time: 17.09 days; intrinsic rate of growth: 0.23 females/day; finite rate of increase: 1.26 individuals/female; and population doubling time: 2.98 days.

Onychogomphus forcipatus unguiculatus suffered significantly higher predation than Onychogomphus uncatus. Activity was much lower in O. uncatus, which is interpreted as an antipredation trait against C. boltonii. The higher activity of O. f. unguiculatus makes it vulnerable to the sit-and-wait predator C. boltonii due to increased encounters. Rearing of both Onychogomphus in field cages under the same conditions of temperature, food availability and density revealed lower growth rates of O. uncatus, which may be interpreted as a cost of the antipredation behaviour. To test whether experimental results have relevance for large-scale distribution patterns of the two Onychogomphus, samples were taken at 23 sites in river-systems of southern France where both species co-occur. In the field I found that O. f unguiculatus does not coexist with C. boltonii at sites where the latter occurs in high numbers. In contrast, O. uncatus is established even at high density of C. boltonii.									17	0	0	0	19	0	21			0003-9136			WOS:000168327200001		
J	Chown, SL; Block, W				Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011	Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105			Comparative nutritional ecology of grass-feeding in a sub-Antarctic beetle: The impact of introduced species on Hydromedion sparsutum from south Georgia								OECOLOGIA				111	2			216	224		10.1007/s004420050228				JUL 1997	1997	South Georgia has many introduced plant and animal species, a consequence of its long history of human habitation. Introduced reindeer have a strong effect on the vegetation of the Stromness Bay area by causing the replacement of indigenous species by grazing-tolerant grasses such as the exotic Poa annua, and in certain circumstances, the indigenous Festuca contracta. Recently it has been argued that an introduced predatory carabid has contributed to declines in the abundance and an increase in the body size of adults of the indigenous perimylopid beetle Hydromedion sparsutum. However, it also appears that body size of these beetles is smaller in areas where exotic grasses predominate compared to undisturbed areas. Here we test the hypothesis that by causing the spread of poorer quality grasses, especially the exotic Poa annua, reindeer may be having an indirect effect on N. sparsutum. To do this eve examined the nutritional ecology of H. sparsutum larvae on four grass species which form a major part of its diet, viz. the indigenous Parodiochloa flabellata, Phleum alpinum and Festuca contracta, and the exotic Poa annua. Larvae showed the highest growth rate on Parodiochloa flabellata: followed by Phleum alpinum, F. contracta and Poa annua. These differences are due to poorer absorption of the exotic grass, and poorer utilization of the absorbed material in the case of F. contracta. Poor growth of larvae on F, contracta appears to be due to its low water and nitrogen contents, whereas in the case of P. annua a combination elf low water content and high nitrogen content may be responsible for low growth rates. Low growth rates associated with poor quality food may lead either to a prolongation of the life cycle or of the length of feeding bouts of an insect. Neither option appears to be feasible for H. sparsutum, and this means that the outcome of feeding on poorer-quality foods would be a reduction in final adult size. This has fitness consequences for the beetle. Hence it appears that by causing the spread of grasses that are unsuitable for growth of H. sparsutum, reindeer may be hating an indirect effect on this beetle species.									16	0	0	0	17	0	18			0029-8549			WOS:A1997XK99200010	28307997

Several outbreaks have occurred with losses estimated at millions of dollars. Insects are affected by climate factors, and climate change may affect geographical range, growth rate, abundance, survival, mortality, number of generations per year and other characteristics. These effects are difficult to project due to the complex interactions among insects, hosts and predators. The aim of the current research is to project the impact of climate change on future suitability for the expansion and final range of FAW as well as highlight the risk of damage due to the pest under current and future conditions. The modelling was carried out using two general circulation models (GCMs), CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H, for 2050 and 2100 under the A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), using the known distribution of the species and the CliMond meteorological database. The possible number of generations was estimated to exceed five in the south-eastern USA by 2100. A unique modelling approach linking environmental suitability and number of generations was developed to project the risks of FAW damage. The results show changes in suitability and risk across America, with an increase in the northern hemisphere and decreases or extinction in the southern hemisphere, except for southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and northern Argentina, which indicate high future levels of risk. The current study highlights the possible extinction of a tropical pest in areas near the Equator. The two GCMs both projected increases in the low-risk category of 40% by 2050 and 23% by 2100, with the medium- and high-risk categories decreasing by >50% by 2050 and >39% by 2100, compared with the current risk. In general, agricultural pest management may become more challenging under future climate change and variation, and thus, understanding and quantifying the possible impacts of FAW under future climate conditions is essential for the future economic production of crops.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0021-8596	1469-5146		WOS:000439880600003

Post-yearling (1+) steelhead fed primarily on hydropsychid larvae, chironomid pupae, zooplankton (primarily daphniids), and baetid subimago and nymphs. Although steelhead supplemented their diets with small terrestrial mammals, crayfish, and several species of fish (greater than or equal to20 mm TL), the estimated mean prey item size ingested was less than 5 mm. Mean prey size did not change relative to fish lifestage or fork length in either year. However average number of prey items per stomach increased with fork length of fish. Steelhead occasionally ingested benthic organisms dislodged from feeding and spawning activities of other salmonids. Small mats of filamentous algae were also consumed throughout the year, presumably for the zooplankton and early instar insects entrained in the material. Overall, the index of fullness for steelhead was less during the 1999 season than in 1998. This decrease may be attributed to cooler water temperatures.

These conditions are met in fruit orchards during winter and in early spring. Spiders of the genera Anyphaena and Philodromus remain active during winter and prey on pests, including overwintering Cacopsylla pyri. As these spiders belong to the same guild they can also disrupt their biocontrol potential via intraguild predation. Hence, we aimed here to assess predation frequency on Cacopsylla and among these spiders over the course of two winters. We investigated the width of the trophic niche and prey preference of the two winter-active spider species. We developed specific primers and investigated the actual predation by means of molecular methods (DNA detection of prey in the gut of spider predators). From a dozen of potential prey types (11 arthropod orders) offered in the laboratory, both Anyphaena and Philodromus accepted the majority of them. The trophic niches of both species were thus wide and the overlap was considerable. Both Anyphaena and Philodromus preferred Cacopsylla to spiders. In the field, the frequency of Anyphaena individuals which fed on Cacopsylla was very high both at the beginning and at the end of winter. The frequency of Anyphaena individuals which fed on Philodromus was low throughout the two studied winters. The ambient temperature did not affect the frequency of which fed on the pest. Over the two winters, Anyphaena captured Cacopsylla significantly more often than Philodromus. Our results show that winter-active spiders accepted the pear psylla frequently and that intraguild predation was much lower than predation on the pest. Thus winter-active spiders have potential to be used as biocontrol agents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									20	0	0	0	18	0	21			0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000389088400008

This balance varies depending on the relative effect of environmental drivers on these processes. Components and dynamics of the C cycle were measured in a native Eucalyptus delegatensis forest at Tumbarumba in south-eastern Australia during conditions of average rainfall (1998-2001) and droughts (2002-2003 and 2006-2007). In 2002-03 there were interacting disturbance factors of dry conditions and insect damage that reduced the photosynthetically active leaf area in the canopy. Conditions during the droughts included reduced soil moisture content, higher temperatures and increased vapour pressure deficit. Similarly low soil moisture contents occurred during both drought periods, but lasted for longer in 2002-03. The combined impact of drought stress and insect damage resulted in markedly reduced growth (45-80%) and higher mortality of trees (5-60%). Impacts were variable across the 50,000 ha of forest, with mortality greatest in stands with normally highest growth rates, and in locations with greatest reductions in soil moisture. Growth rates were reduced during 2002-03, most severely in 2003-04, and recovering in 2004-05. Mortality remained high in 2004-05 indicating the prolonged effect of the stress conditions. The total C pool in the forest is 483 tC ha(-1) with net C uptake of 6.7 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the growing season prior to the insect attack (2001-02). Under conditions of drought and insect disturbance in 2003 the forest released a total of 1.7 tC ha(-1) over 8 months, while under conditions of drought alone carbon uptake was -6.5 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the growing season year of 2006-07 and -5.6 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the calendar year of 2007. Interacting stress factors of drought and insect damage resulted in a large imbalance in the C budget with a 26% reduction in gross primary productivity and a 9% reduction in ecosystem respiration, whereas drought alone had a much lesser effect. Drought conditions result in (1) weather conditions that break the synchronisation of insects with parasites and predators resulting in insect outbreaks, (2) moisture stress that predisposes trees to attack by insects, and (3) moisture stress that restricts leaf regeneration after damage. Climate change and climatically induced changes in disturbance regimes may affect the processes of photosynthesis and respiration differently and hence change the balance of net ecosystem C exchange. Reduced sink strength of forests will lead to positive C cycle-climate feedbacks, which enhance the greenhouse effect and climate change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	RAHEL, FJ; NUTZMAN, JW								FORAGING IN A LETHAL ENVIRONMENT - FISH PREDATION IN HYPOXIC WATERS OF A STRATIFIED LAKE								ECOLOGY				75	5			1246	1253		10.2307/1937450				JUL 1994	1994	Development of low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in bottom waters of stratified lakes has a profound effect on the distribution of aquatic organisms. Fish avoid hypoxic waters by moving into oxygenated water and suffer massive die-offs when migration is not possible. However, central mudminnows (Umbridae: Umbra limi) were captured regularly in severely hypoxic bottom waters of a lake in northern Wisconsin, USA. Caging experiments confirmed the lethality of this environment to mudminnows. The presence of freshly ingested phantom midge larvae (Diptera: Chaoborus) in the stomachs of mudminnows during the day coupled with the observation that Chaoborus are restricted to hypoxic waters during the day indicate that mudminnows routinely ventured into a lethal environment to forage. This conclusion was supported by caging experiments whereby mudminnows denied access to hypoxic water during the day did not contain Chaoborus in their stomachs. In laboratory experiments, ingestion of air bubbles enhanced the ability of mudminnows to forage in hypoxic water, but even in the absence of surface access, mudminnows readily foraged in hypoxic waters. These data help explain reports of other fish venturing into hypoxic waters and suggest that foraging in hypoxic waters may be common among some fishes when food abundance is low in surface waters.									98	1	0	0	89	1	99			0012-9658			WOS:A1994NV66200005

A total of 48,787 mosquitoes were captured during the study. Of these, over 99% belonged to two species, Culex nigripalpus Theobald (2,630) and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (45,946). Other species collected included Culex restuans Theobald, Culex salinarius Coquillett, Aedes aegypti (L.), Aedes albopictus (Skuse), and Uranotaenia lowii Theobald. Significantly greater numbers of Cx. nigripalpus were collected at Vero Beach than at Key West, but no significant differences in numbers of Cx. quinquefasciatus and in total numbers of mosquitoes between the two cities were evident. Rainfall, salinity, type of structure, structure setting, and presence or absence of predators or competitors influenced the numbers of mosquitoes collected and/or the frequency of positive, negative, dry, or flooded samples.									28	0	0	0	25	0	29				1948-7134		WOS:000243418000015	17249351	
J	Govindarajulu, Purnima; Price, Wm Stephen; Anholt, Bradley R.								Introduced bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in western Canada: Has their ecology diverged?								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				40	2			249	260		10.1670/68-05A.1				JUN 2006	2006	Organisms can diverge in life history when introduced outside their native range due to release from predators, competitors, and parasites, and also due to genetic drift and local adaptation. We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20 degrees C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 +/- 7,296 eggs (mean standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range.									32	1	1	0	33	1	34			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000238621400014

Benefits and costs of Leptophlebia (Ephemeroptera) mayfly movements between river channels and floodplain wetlands								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE				89	8			714	723		10.1139/Z11-044				AUG 2011	2011	Dramatic drift of nymphs of the mayflies Leptophlebia Westwood, 1840 and Siphlonurus Eaton, 1868 (47 600 individuals/trap per hour) was observed between a southeastern USA river and adjacent floodplain following natural flooding events. Active movements of these nymphs against the water flow were also detected. Large numbers of leptophlebid nymphs reside in floodplains during the winter and spring, but how and why they colonize and develop in temporary habitats is uncertain. We detected few environmental advantages (i.e., temperature, food abundance or quality) for mayflies in floodplains compared with river habitats. Despite this, experiments indicated that mayflies had 36% higher growth rates in the floodplain than in the river and demonstrated tolerance to short-term drying (up to 12 d). Migration entails costs of migrating against flows during daylight when vulnerability to predation is high, colonizing a habitat subject to drying, hypoxia, and supporting amphibian predators, with few apparent benefits. Dispersal into wetlands may be attributed to avoiding swift river flows or exploiting largely fishless habitats. However, dispersal could be an evolutionary relic of behavior beneficial in more northerly habitats; our study populations of Leptophlebia mayflies were at the southern extreme of their range and perhaps operating suboptimally. Our results emphasize the importance of river floodplain linkages to the ecology of both habitats.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0008-4301			WOS:000295390200007

Using response surface regression, the following environmental variables were examined: number of rainy days per week, precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures, minimum relative air humidity, and daylength. A time-variable, year, was included to account for the variance between years. From step-wise exclusion of variables with the lowest contribution to the model fit, a model was generated which included three environmental variables (daylength, minimum relative air humidity, and minimum temperature) that explained 55% of the total variance, and the yearly variable explaining 8%. The response surface regression analysis of P. truncatus flight activity revealed the following: (1) it was positively correlated with daylength when daily minimum temperature and relative air humidity were low, (2) it was positively associated with minimum relative air humidity when lower than 75%, (3) it was negatively associated with minimum temperature, (4) unexplained yearly variation was important for the predictive strength of the model, (5) interactions of environmental variables contributed substantially to the model fit, and (6) precipitation, both as mm rain and as number of rainy days, had little influence on Pi truncatus flight activity. Independent data showed that the model predicted P. truncates flight activity well elsewhere in southern Benin, whereas in central Benin new coefficients for the same environmental variables were needed to produce an adequate prediction. The model did not fit pheromone baited trap catches from northern Benin.									21	0	0	0	20	0	22			0046-225X			WOS:000172937000021

Do thermal factors influence foraging-site selection by ectothermic predators? Snake species that obtain their prey from ambush must remain immobile for long periods, precluding overt behavioural thermoregulation; and some "ambush" snakes use thermal cues to detect endothermic prey. Plausibly, alternative ambush sites might differ either in equilibrial body temperatures available to snakes, or in the thermal "background" against which prey items must be detected.2. We examined this topic with field data on pit-vipers (Gloydius shedaoensis) on a small island in northeastern China. Adult snakes feed only on migrating passerine birds. The snakes ambush birds both from arboreal perches (branches of small trees) and from the ground.3. Arboreal versus terrestrial ambush sites differed both in operative temperatures and thermal "backgrounds" available to the snakes. Operative temperatures inside copper models were lower in trees than on the ground (because of wind), and snakes in arboreal ambush sites were cooler than those in terrestrial sites. Thermal backgrounds from arboreal perches were cooler (and thus, provided more contrast against prey items) than did backgrounds available from terrestrial ambush-sites.4. Thermal factors thus modify the suitability of alternative ambush locations for these pit-vipers, but with a trade-off: a snake in a tree can "see" its prey more clearly, but may not be warm enough (and hence, able to strike fast enough) to capture it. Further work is required to determine whether or not snakes actually use such thermal differences as criteria for the selection of ambush sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study evaluated the functional responses and prey-stage preferences of three species of predators, a predatory gall midge, Feltiella acarisuga (Vallot) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and two predatory mite species, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and Amblyseius swirskii (Anthias-Henriot), with T. urticae as the host, under laboratory conditions. The results showed that F. acarisuga was highly effective and the two species of predacious mites were moderately effective in feeding on T. urticae eggs. Logistic regression analysis suggested Type II (convex) functional responses for all three species. However, based on the estimates of the handling time and the attacking rates, the three predators had different predation capacities. Among the three species, F. acarisuga had the highest predation on T. urticae. The maximum daily predation by a larval F. acarisuga was 50 eggs/day, followed by a female N. californicus (25.6 eggs/day) and a female A. swirskii (15.1 eggs/day). A female N. californicus produced more eggs than a female A. swirskii did when they both fed on T. urticae eggs. In addition, all three predator species had no prey-stage preference for either prey eggs or nymphs. The findings from this study could help select better biological control agents for effective control of T. urticae and other pests in vegetable productions.									14	0	0	0	13	0	15				1536-2442		WOS:000315164500002	23879370

Aerial and ground foraging were the main hunting methods employed by hawks in this region. The overall hunting success of hawks preying on insects was 50% and age-related differences in hunting success were not significant. The Swainson's hawks, however, hunted more successfully in the air (65% of prey capture attempts) than on the ground (42%). Aerial hunting while soaring was the most successful hunting method based on the number of prey captured per energy unit. Based on the analysis of prey consumed by hawks during the study period, grasshopper species with poor flight capabilities were available in the air as a consequence of the vertical air motion. With regards to daily activity patterns, the time that a hawk spent using each hunting method was not proportional to the cost ratio associated with each method. Hawks foraged in the air only during midday hours when weather conditions permitted the formation of thermals. Thus, the use of soaring flights and the availability of prey in the air were constrained by the physical environment, and hawks could only exploit airborne food sources during limited periods of the day.									13	0	0	0	14	3	17			0008-4301			WOS:000233824300010

However, little is known about the factors that determine its selection of microhabitat, except that it does not actively thermoregulate. For example, geckos may forage near lights due to presence of higher concentrations of flying insects or they may select darker sites near refugia to avoid predators. This study investigates the influence of ambient light level (irradiance) and distance to a refuge on selection of microhabitat. During their normal activity period, 54 geckos were hand captured. Snoutvent length, mass, sex, irradiance, and distance to the nearest refuge (crack, crevice, or hole) were determined for each lizard at the time and place of capture. juvenile geckos tended to be in areas with higher irradiance and farther from reftigia than adults. All adults generally selected sites closer to refugia. Adult male and female geckos did not differ significantly in selection of microsites. Thus, we suggest that adult lizards, especially territorial males, exclude juveniles from sites closer to refugia, which are typically of lower irradiance.									15	1	0	0	16	1	18			0038-4909	1943-6262		WOS:000251738600015

Adults of A. bilineata feed on eggs and larvae of root maggots, and A. bilineata larvae parasitize Delia spp. pupae. Emergence and seasonal activity patterns of A. bilineata were investigated during 2003-2005 in canola (Brassica rapa L. and Brassica napus L.) in central Alberta, Canada, in relation to degree-day (DD) accumulations and Julian date. Captures of A. bilineata adults from pitfall traps within emergence cages situated over canola stubble from the previous year indicated that approximate to 428,493, and 455 DD (soil base 5.57 degrees C) and 187,189, and 180 Julian days were required for 50% emergence in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively (3-yr mean = 185.1 +/- 2.8 Julian days [SEMI). Captures of A. bilineata adults from pitfall traps placed in current canola crops determined that 50% levels of activity density required 379 DD and 180 Julian days in 2004. A logistic model that described the relationship of degree-days and Julian days with emergence of adult beetles was appraised, and good correspondence was evident between predicted and observed cumulative emergence patterns. Emergence and seasonal activity periods of A. bilineata in canola were well synchronized with occurrence of preimaginal life stages of its principal hosts, Delia radiacum (L.) and Delia platura Meigen, with beetle emergence beginning shortly after the onset of root maggot oviposition.									8	0	0	0	9	0	9			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000261633200011	19161688

A realistic quantification of chemical toxicity to populations calls for the use of methodologies that integrate these multiple stress effects. The authors used an individual-based model for Daphnia magna as a virtual laboratory to determine the influence of ecological interactions on population sensitivity to chemicals with different modes of action on individuals. In the model, hypothetical chemical toxicity targeted different vital individual-level processes: reproduction, survival, feeding rate, or somatic growth rate. As for species interactions, predatory and competition effects on daphnid populations were implemented following a worst-case approach. The population abundance was simulated at different food levels and exposure scenarios, assuming exposure to chemical stress solely or in combination with either competition or predation. The chemical always targeted one vital endpoint. Equal toxicity-inhibition levels differently affected the population abundance with and without species interactions. In addition, population responses to chemicals were highly sensitive to the environmental stressor (predator or competitor) and to the food level. Results show that population resilience cannot be attributed to chemical stress only. Accounting for the relevant ecological interactions would reduce uncertainties when extrapolating effects of chemicals from individuals to the population level. Validated population models should be used for a more realistic risk assessment of chemicals. (C) 2014 SETAC									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0730-7268	1552-8618		WOS:000337784500006	24114796

The Cyrtarachninae is a group of spiders specialized in catching moths, which is thought to have evolved from ordinary orb-weaving araneids. Although the web-building time of nocturnal spiders is in general related to the time of sunset, anecdotal evidence has suggested variability of web-building time in Cyrtarachne and its closely related genera. This study has examined the effects of temperature, humidity, moonlight intensity, and prey (moths) availability on web-building time of Cyrtarachne bufo, Cyrtarachne akirai, and Cyrtarachne nagasakiensis. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) have revealed that humidity, and not prey availability, was the essential variable that explained the daily variability of web-building time. Experiments measuring thread stickiness under different humidities showed that, although the thread of Cyrtarachne was found to have strong stickiness under high humidity, low humidity caused a marked decrease of thread stickiness. By contrast, no obvious change in stickiness was seen in an ordinary orb-weaving spider, Larinia argiopiformis. These findings suggest that Cyrtarachne adjusts its web-building time to favorable conditions of high humidity maintaining strong stickiness, which enables the threads to work efficiently for capturing prey.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0028-1042	1432-1904		WOS:000338998900008	24916857

The objective of this research was to model the relationship between seasonal changes in arthropod abundance and weather variables using data from a collaborative pan-Canadian (Southampton, Herschel, Bylot, and Ellesmere Islands) study on terrestrial arthropods. Arthropods were captured with passive traps that provided a combined measure of abundance and activity (a proxy for arthropod availability to foraging birds). We found that 70% of the deviance in daily arthropod availability was explained by three temperature covariates: mean daily temperature, thaw degree-day, and thaw degree-day(2). Models had an adjusted R-2 of 0.29-0.95 with an average among sites and arthropod families of 0.67. This indicates a moderate to strong fit to the raw data. The models for arthropod families with synchronous emergence, such as Tipulidae (Diptera), had a better fit (average adjusted R-2 of 0.80) than less synchronous taxa, such as Araneae (R-2 = 0.60). Arthropod abundance was typically higher in wet than in mesic habitats. Our models will serve as tools for researchers who want to correlate insectivorous bird breeding data to arthropod availability in the Canadian Arctic.									33	0	0	0	32	0	35			0008-347X	1918-3240		WOS:000316611300004

To date, there is no consensus on whether warming increases or decreases consumer needs for dietary carbon (C) relatively to phosphorus (P), thus hindering predictions of secondary production responses to global change. Here, we investigate how the dietary C:P ratio optimising consumer growth (TERC:P: Threshold Elemental Ratio) changes along temperature gradients by combining a temperature-dependent TERC:P model with growth experiments on Daphnia magna. Both lines of evidence show that the TERC:P response to temperature is U-shaped. This shape indicates that consumer nutrient requirements can both increase or decrease with increasing temperature, thus reconciling previous contradictive observations into a common framework. This unified framework improves our capacity to forecast the combined effects of nutrient cycle and climatic alterations on invertebrate production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000525566900009	32212238

The diets of 41 individuals of this terrestrial bird species captured in three zones of the temperate rain forest region of southern Chile (38-degrees-42-degrees-S) were investigated analyzing their stomach contents. We recorded the diversity and abundance of invertebrates and identified the seeds of local plant species present in the stomachs. Coleoptera (83%) and Hymenoptera (75%) were the most frequent insect orders in the diet of the three bird populations. Amomyrtus luma was the most frequent of the fleshy fruits consumed by this species. The seeds found in 66% of the stomachs and the variety of invertebrates found in 95% of the stomachs of the birds from all three populations confirm that this species is an omnivore. The relative importance of fleshy fruits and invertebrates in the diet of S. rubecula may depend on seasonal or regional changes in the abundance of these resources in the temperature rain forest of southern Chile.									11	0	0	0	13	7	14			0716-078X			WOS:A1990FV29000008

In general the number of individuals and species increased after fire. The species attracted to the burnt forest included wood-borers (Cerambycidae, Curculionidae, Anobiidae, some Elateridae), species developing under bark of damaged trees, species associated with fungi (Lathrididae, Cryptophagidae, Nitidulidae, Leiodidae) and certain soil- and litter-dwelling groups: Carabidae, Byrrhidae and some Elateridae. Predators utilizing diptera larvae in mushrooms increased strongly after the fire as well. Many of the species presumed to be associated with wood-fungi peaked immediately after the fire, i.e. many cryptophagids, lathridids and nitidulids, whereas the leiodids Anisotoma spp. and Agathidium spp. became commoner two years after the fire. Several species previously known to strongly prefer burnt forests were captured. The fire specialists form a hetergenous ecological group, indicating that a substantial portion of the forest species have adapted to fire cycles. A large group of species normally found only in man-made, microclimatically warm habitats, e.g. compost, were attracted to two of the burnt sites. Their absence from the third site was probably due to lack of suitable source areas in the immediate surroundings. Cholevidae associated with rodents and many litter-dwelling Staphylinidae were drastically reduced by the fire. In most cases, their numbers had not returned to previous levels two years after the burning.									96	1	4	0	92	2	107			0003-455X			WOS:A1994MX18100011

The objective of this Study was to review information on dirofilariasis in the country. and to report our recent findings oil mosquito vectors. Since the first report of dogs with unidentified microfilariae in 1926. D. immitis was found in seven provinces and canine prevalence ranged 0-71% at local scale. National prevalence was 8% by the end of the 1980s and current information is available only for Buenos Aires Province. Four pulmonary human infections of D. immitis and one subcutaneous of Dirofilaria sp. were documented. The common coati was the only wild host found. and natural infection in mosquitoes was not previously reported in the country. In our recent mosquito survey in Greater Buenos Aires, we captured and dissected 2380 mosquitoes belonging to 20 species. According to a minimum temperature of 14 degrees C the potential transmission period (PTP) for D. immitis in Buenos Aires covers 6 months, and the most favourable period (mean temperature above 20 degrees C) takes place from the middle of November to the beginning of April. To identify potential vectors of the parasite, we assessed weekly abundances of mosquito species during those PTP estimated previously. We found two specimens of Cidex pipiens and one of Aedes aegypti carrying non-infective stages of D. immitis. These two highly anthropophilic mosquitoes may enhance the role of D. immitis as zoonotic agent in temperate Argentina. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Four release sites, including one in the Central Valley and three along the Monterey Bay, were monitored from 1999 to 2015. Lygus spp. and P. relictus populations were monitored in alfalfa, weedy non-crop vegetation, and commercial strawberries. An experimental field cage study was also conducted to measure the contribution of both P. relictus and resident predators to Lygus spp. mortality. Results from both caging and longitudinal studies demonstrated that P. relictus had a negative impact on Lygus spp. nymphal densities.Annual percent parasitism peaks ranged from 45 to 71% in alfalfa or non-crop vegetation, which were either correlated with host densities or demonstrated a delayed density dependent response. Lygus spp. population reductions of over 90% were recorded at five of six sampling locations by 2011-2012. An increase in Lygus spp. densities was observed at two release sites during the last two years of monitoring in the Monterey Bay region and may be related to climate. In-season nymphal densities were correlated with winter temperatures, as warmer than average winters may have affected diapause and accelerated population growth rates. We consider this study, which corroborates the preference by P. relictus for congeneric North American host species, the biological control value of this parasitoid's establishment, and climate as a possible contributor to Lygus spp. population dynamics, to be a valuable contribution to understanding biological control of Lygus spp. by P. relictus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000411473000005

The urban heat island (UHI) effect describes the capture of heat by built structures (e.g. asphalt), resulting in elevated urban temperatures. The UHI is a well-studied phenomenon, but only a handful of studies have investigated trait-based shifts resulting from the UHI, and even fewer have attempted to quantify the magnitude of the UHI experienced at the microclimate scale. Here, using a common urban exploiter, the Western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus), we show that the UHI experienced by spiders in July in their urban Phoenix, AZ refuges is 6 degrees C hotter (33 degrees C) than conditions in the refuges of spiders from Sonoran Desert habitat outside of Phoenix's development (27 degrees C). We then use this field microclimate UHI estimate to compare the development speed, mass gain and mortality of replicate siblings from 36 urban lineages reared at 'urban' and 'desert' temperatures. We show that extreme heat is slowing the growth of spiderlings and increasing mortality. In contrast, we show that development of male spiders to their penultimate moult is accelerated by 2 weeks. Lastly, in terms of behavioral shifts, UHI temperatures caused late-stage juvenile male spiders to heighten their foraging voracity and late-stage juvenile female spiders to curtail their web-building behavior. Trait-based approaches like the one presented herein help us better understand the mechanisms that lead to the explosive population growth of urban (sometimes invasive) species, possibly at the expense of urban biodiversity. Studies of organismal responses to the present day UHI can be used as informative surrogates that help us grasp the impact that projected climate change will have on biodiversity.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000532119700010	31490963

Ant colonies exhibited nocturnal activity throughout the year, and they foraged significantly more intensively in the wet/warm (November-March) than in the cold/dry season (April-October). As the night begins, small groups of workers disperse and hunt individually on a wide diversity of litter arthropods of variable sizes. At dusk, encounters with foragers of the diurnal ponerine Pachycondyla striata Fr. Smith were conspicuously avoided by O.chelifer, which occasionally had their prey robbed by the former or were even taken as prey themselves. Termites were the preferred prey of O. chelifer, making up 40% of the food items captured in each season. Seasonal comparisons of prey organisms captured by O. chelifer, and of litter-dwelling arthropods sampled in pitfall traps, revealed that the frequency distribution Of retrieved prey in each taxonomic group did not differ seasonally, despite the 2.7-fold increase in the overall availability of litter arthropods in the warm/wet period. This result supports foraging theory by showing that preference for certain animal prey types (i.e., taxonomic groups) persists through time despite seasonal fluctuations in the overall availability of potential prey oil the forest floor. This study points out to the importance of studying ant foraging ecology and diet preferences in a natural context.									27	1	0	0	28	2	29			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000271533300025

Typhlodromus athenas Swirski and Ragusa is an indigenous mite in the Mediterranean region and data on its temperature dependent development are lacking. In the current study, temperature-dependent development and survival of T. athenas immature stages were evaluated on eggs and all stages of Tetranychus urticae Koch, as well as on almond (Prunus amygdalis Batsch) pollen, under seven constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 degrees C, 65% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. On both diets survival was considerably high at all temperatures. The longest developmental period of immature stages was recorded at 15 degrees C, whereas the shortest was at 30 degrees C. Female immatures on almond pollen had shorter developmental time compared to that on twospotted spider mites. Food had a significant effect on female total developmental time at temperatures lower than 25 degrees C. The lower developmental thresholds, estimated by a linear model, for egg-to-adult of females and males fed on pollen were 8.60 and 8.77 degrees C, respectively, whereas on T. urticae they were 10.15 and 10.62 degrees C, respectively. Higher values of t(min) for total development were estimated by a nonlinear model (Lactin-2), and ranged from 10.21 degrees C for both females and males on almond, to 11.07 for females and 10.78 degrees C for males on prey. Moreover, this model estimated optimal and lethal temperatures accurately. The results of this study indicate that T. athenas appears better adapted to higher temperatures that occur in the Mediterranean region and may be a useful biological control agent.									5	0	0	0	6	0	6			0046-225X			WOS:000298714300031	22217776

Nutritional performance, digestive enzymatic activities and growth indices of the fifth instar larvae of E. kuehniella were evaluated on flour of seven barley (Fajr 30, Reihan 03, 5 Shoor, Dasht, Sahra, Khorram and EH-83-7) and two wheat (Bam and Sepahan) cultivars at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% R.H., and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. The results show that the highest larval growth index was observed when larvae were fed barley cultivar Reihan03. The highest and lowest values of larval weight gain were on barley cultivars EH-83-7 and Sahra, respectively. The highest value of efficiency of conversion of ingested food was in larvae reared on barley cultivar EH-83-7, whereas the lowest value was on barley cultivar Sahra. Moreover, the highest relative growth rate was detected on barley cultivar EH-83-7. The highest and lowest levels of amylolytic activity were on wheat cultivar Bam and barley cultivar Khorram, respectively. The highest proteolytic activity was observed in larvae reared on barley cultivar Fajr 30, whereas the lowest activity was on barley cultivars Dasht, Khorram and wheat cultivar Bam. Finally, barley cultivars EH-83-7 and Reihan 03 can be suggested as the most suitable cultivars for laboratory rearing of E. kuehniella.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			0024-0966			WOS:000372213700001

Habitat conditions and physiological optima offer predictive information for IAS impacts in novel environments. Here, using meta-analysis and laboratory experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the impacts of IAS in the field are inversely correlated with the difference in their ambient and optimal temperatures. A meta-analysis of 29 studies of consumptive impacts of IAS in inland waters revealed that the impacts of fishes and crustaceans are higher at temperatures that more closely match their thermal growth optima. In particular, the maximum impact potential was constrained by increased differences between ambient and optimal temperatures, as indicated by the steeper slope of a quantile regression on the upper 25th percentile of impact data compared to that of a weighted linear regression on all data with measured variances. We complemented this study with an experimental analysis of the functional response (the relationship between predation rate and prey supply) of two invasive predators (freshwater mysid shrimp, Hemimysis anomala and Mysis diluviana) across relevant temperature gradients; both of these species have previously been found to exert strong community-level impacts that are corroborated by their functional responses to different prey items. The functional response experiments showed that maximum feeding rates of H. anomala and M. diluviana have distinct peaks near their respective thermal optima. Although variation in impacts may be caused by numerous abiotic or biotic habitat characteristics, both our analyses point to temperature as a key mediator of IAS impact levels in inland waters and suggest that IAS management should prioritize habitats in the invaded range that more closely match the thermal optima of targeted invaders.									31	0	0	0	29	0	31			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000351849700011	26214916	
J	Schlosser, IJ				Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009				Fish recruitment, dispersal, and trophic interactions in a heterogeneous lotic environment								OECOLOGIA				113	2			260	268		10.1007/s004420050377				JAN 1998	1998	I examine how dispersal of juvenile creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) from beaver ponds into adjacent stream environments interacts with temporal abiotic variability to influence fish foraging, growth, and long-term persistence in the lotic ecosystem. Minnow trapping in upstream and downstream beaver ponds, along with weir traps used to monitor directional movement, indicated that most chubs colonized the stream from the downstream beaver pond. Large annual fluctuations in density of age 0 creek chubs occurred in the stream over a 10-year sampling period. Multiple regression analysis indicated that stream temperature, precipitation, and the density of reproductive creek chubs were not correlated with summer density of age 0 chubs in the stream. The factor most strongly associated with increased density of age 0 creek chubs was creation of the downstream beaver pond during the 6th-7th years of the study, suggesting dispersal from the pond was the primary factor determining age 0 fish density in the stream. Most individuals in the strong year classes neither persisted in the stream through their first winter nor resulted in an increased abundance of older age classes in later years. Comparison of age 0 fish density in summer to the proportion of fish surviving to age 1 in spring suggested that overwinter mortality was density dependent. Furthermore, a comparison of the size structure for age 0 individuals in summer to age 1 individuals the following spring indicated that winter mortality was size dependent. Experiments in an artificial stream adjacent to the natural channel revealed that fish growth was strongly density dependent, decreasing as fish density increased across both spring and summer, and elevated and low discharge. The decline in invertebrate prey captured by the fish and the subsequent decline in fish growth appeared to be particularly pronounced under low discharge in summer. Changes in juvenile creek chub density had no significant effect on benthic insect or crustacean abundance, suggesting that exploitative competition for limited invertebrate drift resources was a more important cause of density-dependent growth than depressed local benthic invertebrate abundance. These results suggest that lotic regions adjacent to beaver ponds act as potential reproductive "sinks" for dispersing juveniles confronting seasonal and flow-mediated restrictions on resource acquisition and growth, and the occurrence of seasonal bottlenecks to their survival, especially harsh winter conditions.									67	0	0	0	65	1	68			0029-8549			WOS:000071658500015	28308206

This study investigated baseline predation of immature mosquitoes by macroinvertebrate predators along the Mara River, determined the diversity of predators and mosquito larvae habitats and the range of their adaptive capacity to water physico-chemical parameters. Between July and August 2011, sampling sites (n=39) along the Mara River were selected and investigated for the presence of macroinvertebrate predators and mosquito larvae. The selected sampling sites were geocoded and each dipped 20 times using standard mosquito larvae dipper to sample mosquito larvae, while a D-frame dip net was used to capture the macroinvertebrate predators. Water physico-chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity and turbidity) were taken in situ at access points, while hardness and alkalinity were measured titrimetically. The influence of macroinvertebrate predator occurrence was correlated with mosquito larvae and water quality parameters using Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Predators (n=297) belonging to 3 orders of Hemiptera (54.2%), Odonata (22.9%) and Coleoptera (22.9%), and mosquito larvae (n=4001) belonging to 10 species, which included An. gambiae s.l (44.9%), Culex spp. (34.8%) and An. coustani complex (13.8%), An. maculipalpis (3.6%), An. phaorensis (1.2%), An. funestus group (0.5%), An. azaniae (0.4%), An. hamoni (0.3%), An. christyi (0.3%), An. ardensis (0.08%), An. faini (0.07%), An. sergentii (0.05%) and 0.05% of Aedes mosquito larvae which were not identified to species level, due to lack of an appropriate key, were captured from different habitats along the Mara river. It was established that invasion of habitats by the macroinvertebrate predators were partially driven by the presence of mosquito larvae (p < 0.001), and the prevailing water physico-chemical parameters (DO, temperature, and turbidity, p <0.001). Understanding abiotic and biotic factors which favour mosquitoes and macroinveterbrate co-occurrence may contribute to the control of malaria.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12			2193-1801			WOS:000359195000003	25830082

They are annual, or most communly, perennial herbs known as carnivorous plants, whose leaves are transformed into traps for the capture and digestion of small insects as an adaptation for supplying nutricional deficiencies. They usually occur in distrophic substrata. In order to contribute to conservation plans for the species of the genus, threatened by the conversion of the natural grasslands into pastures, we tried to define their preferential habitats and climatic requirements. We verified that the variables of microhabitat and altitude presented significant correlation at 5% probability level, while the variables in annual average relative humidity annual average temperature and type of substratum types did not show significant correlation.									2	0	0	0	3	1	3			1516-8913	1678-4324		WOS:000223676100001

Salvelinus malma from the Pedro Bay ponds were the smallest for a given age, followed by Salvelinus alpinus from the lake, and S. malma from the Iliamna River were much larger. The utilization of a large sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka subsidy by the three Salvelinus spp. populations was then investigated by comparing diet data and mixing model (MixSIR) outputs based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. Stomach contents indicated that both S. malma populations fed on O. nerka products, especially eggs and larval Diptera that had scavenged O. nerka carcasses, whereas S. alpinus fed on a variety of prey items such as three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and snails. Stable-isotope analysis corroborated the diet data; the two S. malma populations incorporated more O. nerka-derived nutrients into their tissues than did S. alpinus from the lake, although all populations showed substantial utilization of O. nerka-derived resources. Salvelinus alpinus also seemed to be much more omnivorous, as shown by stable-isotope mixing models, than the S. malma populations. The dramatic differences in growth rate between the two S. malma populations, despite similar trophic patterns, indicate that other important genetic or environmental factors affect their life history, including proximate temperature controls and ultimate predation pressures.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000281713700016	20840627

However, in the past years, sandflies have been documented in Germany, Belgium, and recently, also in Austria, close to the Slovenian border. Moreover, autochthonous human Leishmania and Phlebovirus infections have been reported in Central Europe, particularly in Germany. From 2010 to 2012, sandfly trapping (740 trap nights) was performed at 53 different capture sites in Austria using battery-operated CDC miniature light traps. Sites were chosen on the basis of their climate profile in the federal states Styria, Burgenland, and Lower Austria. Sandfly specimens found were transferred to 70 % ethanol for conservation. Identification was based on morphological characters of the male genitalia and the female spermathecae, respectively. Altogether, 24 specimens, 22 females and 2 males, all identified as Phlebotomus (Transphlebotomus) mascittii Grassi, 1908, were found at six different sampling sites in all three federal states investigated. The highest number of catches was made on a farm in Lower Austria. Altogether, the period of sandfly activity in Austria was shown to be much longer than presumed, the earliest capture was made on July 3rd and the latest on August 28th. Sandflies have been autochthonous in Austria in small foci probably for long, but in the course of global warming, further spreading may be expected. Although P. mascittii is only an assumed vector of Leishmania spp.-data on its experimental transmission capacity are still lacking-the wide distribution of sandflies in Austria, a country thought to be free of sandflies, further supports a potential emergence of sandflies in Central Europe. This is of medical relevance, not only with respect to the transmission of Leishmania spp. for which a reservoir is given in dogs, but also with respect to the phleboviruses.									21	0	0	0	11	0	22			0932-0113	1432-1955		WOS:000327141300028	24126902

The factors that constrain habitat use are diverse and often difficult to identify, but are important to distinguish if we are to understand the trade-offs that drive species to become specialists. In the present study, we investigated habitat use in a fossorial skink, Lerista labialis, and explore the factors that confine it to the crests of sand dunes in the Simpson Desert, central Australia. Models positing that L. labialis selects dune crests because of their sparse cover of vegetation, more favourable temperatures, and greater abundance of preferred prey, received no support. Instead, a model positing that dune crests provide soft and less compacted sand that facilitates movement by L. labialis, was strongly supported. Sand on the crests was consistently softer that that on the sides and swales of the dunes; the skinks preferred soft rather than hard sand for movement in captivity, and were captured more often on experimentally softened sand than on compacted sand in the field. There was no evidence that L. labialis responds to attributes of the substrate other than softness because captive animals used loose sand from the dune crests, sides, and swales equally. We suggest that the dune crest environment allows L. labialis to reduce the energetic costs of locomotion, provides priority of access to the subterranean galleries of its termite prey, and also a secure refuge from surface-active predators and extreme surface temperatures.

In a climate change context, increased warming and dryness will likely affect arthropod communities of agro-ecosystems managed by biological pest control. In this work, we compare, at the individual level, the functional relation between temperature and relative humidity and different life-history parameters in two sister predatory mite species that inhabit Spanish avocado crops, Euseius stipulatus and E. scutalis (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). We found that negative effects of high temperature and low relative humidity were stronger in E. stipulatus than in E. scutalis. That E. scutalis tolerates very well hot and dry environments makes the species a good candidate to be considered in the future as a biocontrol agent against pests in subtropical and Mediterranean orchards.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000437121600011

To monitor and manage this pest effectively it is necessary to understand its population dynamics and demographics, as well as the physiological responses of soybean plants to its feeding. In this study, using field surveying and suction-trap monitoring, we investigated the population dynamics of the soybean aphid in Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province in northeastern China during 2009-2012. The results indicated that the population dynamics of the soybean aphid followed a unimodal curve distribution, with the insect generally colonizing soybean fields from the middle of June to early July and the population reaching a peak between early July and early August. On the whole, soybean aphids occurred in suction-traps at least 2 weeks earlier than they were found in field surveys. A total of 72 alates were collected by suction-trapping over the 4 years, with the earliest alate captures occurring 011 28 May in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 4 June in 2010. The life table parameters clearly showed that this aphid had a short doubling time (4.73 +/- 0.21 days), and 7.36 +/- 0.98 nymphs were produced by a soybean aphid adult during its lifetime (13.57 +/- 0.30 days). Finally, biochemical assays indicated that the amount of malondialdehyde and the activities of four defense-related enzymes in soybean leaves significantly changed between 0 day and 7 days of aphid infestation. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and catalase (CAT) activities increased more dramatically after 1 day of aphid feeding. In addition, significantly higher levels of superoxide dismutase and CAT were found after aphid feeding for 7 days, whereas there was no significant change in the activities of peroxidase and PPO. Consequently, this study will be beneficial in determining the seasonal occurrence of the soybean aphid and selecting insect-resistant soybean varieties, and thus in developing a theoretical framework for appropriate management strategies.									8	3	0	0	6	0	9			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000336463400010	24376198

Different cues are reported for ephippia production, for example food limitation, changes in photoperiod and temperature, the presence of predators, nutrient depletion or signals of crowding. However, the reliability of these cues strongly depends on the local habitat. In Daphnia galeata, ephippia production might not be subject to any of the environmental cues outlined. Here, we directly test whether changes in crowding alone provides a reliable cue for D. galeata to switch reproductive mode. We conducted life history assays using 10 genotypes of D. galeata from a Swiss Lake to investigate density dependent reproduction and production of ephippia. We started populations at different densities and eliminated competition for food by systematically increasing food availability with population size. Our results suggest that population density depresses population growth rate via a change in energy allocation from current into future reproduction in D. galeata. Thus, signals of crowding produced at high population density constitute a reliable and sufficient cue for D. galeata to switch from asexual to sexual reproduction.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000500845500005

Both warming and biotic interactions have been identified to magnify the effects of toxicants. Moreover, while biotic interactions may change the impact of toxicants, toxicants may also change the impact of biotic interactions. However, studies looking at the impact of biotic interactions on the toxicity of pesticides and vice versa under warming are very scarce. Therefore, we tested how warming (+4 degrees C), intraspecific competition (density treatment) and exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos, both in isolation and in combination, affected mortality, cannibalism, growth and heat tolerance of low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Moreover, we addressed whether toxicant exposure, potentially in interaction with competition and warming, increased the frequency of autotomy, a widespread antipredator mechanism. Competition increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos and made it become lethal. Cannibalism was not affected by chlorpyrifos but increased at high density and under warming. Chlorpyrifos reduced heat tolerance but only when competition was high. This is the first demonstration that a biotic interaction can be a major determinant of 'toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity'. Competition enhanced the impact of chlorpyrifos under warming for high-latitude larvae, leading to an increase in autotomy which reduces fitness in the long term. This points to a novel' pathway how transient pesticide pulses may cause delayed effects on populations in a warming world. Our results highlight that the interplay between biotic interactions and toxicants have a strong relevance for ecological risk assessment in a warming polluted world. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Derby Day (green-leaved), Minicole (green-leaved) and Ruby Ball (red-leaved). In a laboratory-based tritrophic system including both species of aphid, the three cabbage cultivars and A. aphidimyza, predator larvae grew most rapidly when feeding on M. persicae or B. brassicae on cv. Derby Day, while growth was slowest on cv. Ruby Ball, although these differences were not always significant. In a separate experiment, A. aphidimyza larvae feeding on B. brassicae on each of the three cultivars were significantly smaller and consumed less aphid fresh weight when maintained outdoors (mean temperature = 13.5 degrees C) compared with a constant environment room (20 degrees C). However, in this latter experiment under neither regime were differences in predator growth or consumption significant between cultivars. Effects of selective insecticides (pirimicarb and a neem seed kernel extract, NeemAzal-T/S(R)) on bitrophic (aphid-host plant) interactions were also investigated in the laboratory. A pirimicarb dose equating to c. 15% of the recommended field concentration caused equivalent toxicity of M. persicae on cv. Minicole compared with aphids treated with a three-fold greater dose and reared on cv. Derby Day. Cultivar-mediated differences in aphid mortality caused by the neem extract when tested for systemic and translaminar activity were not apparent. The results are discussed in relation to ways in which host plant selection, selective insecticides and biological control could potentially be manipulated and optimized in aphid management systems on brassica crops.									14	0	0	0	16	3	18			0007-4853			WOS:000074382100013

Activity recordings have revealed that the beetles are strictly nocturnal. They are resistant to desiccation and prefer temperatures above 30 degrees C. Their flat body indicates adaptation to life in clay soils, which, in southern Italy, are deeply. fissured from April to September. The behaviour of the beetles was observed in a,I transparent system of cavities consisting of plastic boxes connected by tubes. The beetles feed exclusively on ants that are caught by surprise attack outside their nests. Ants perceive the beetles as being hostile via chemical cues. Single ants then normally retreat, whereas groups of ants attack immediately. The beetles behave unaggressively against cospecifics and rest in groups of various numbers in flat soil crevices. Copulation takes place from the end of April onwards, whereas egg laying occurs from the end of May onwards. The females produce only a few eggs, which are unusually large, and shift them singly in narrow soil cracks. The larvae develop during the summer deep in the soil: they are blind and can be characterized as cave-life forms by their extremely long cerci and antennae that. have a whip-like unsclerotized sticky distal part.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1125-0003	1748-5851		WOS:000228648600006

Hypoxia but not shy-bold phenotype mediates thermal preferences in a threatened freshwater fish, Notropis percobromus								JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY				84				479	487		10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.08.001				AUG 2019	2019	For ectothermic animals, ambient temperature strongly influences developmental growth rate and individual fitness. While many ectotherms live in environments that are spatially hetero-thermal, the coupling between behavioural phenotypes (e.g., shy or bold behaviour) and thermal preferences remains uncertain. Relative to shy counterparts, bolder phenotypes may exert higher preference for ambient temperatures that are closer to their thermal optimum, thereby accelerating development. In addition, ectotherms should select colder temperatures in low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis. Using wild caught carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus), this study examined thermoregulatory behaviour in individuals exhibiting consistent behavioural phenotypes along the shy-bold continuum and between ecologically relevant normal oxygen concentration (normoxic) and hypoxic treatments. Furthermore, the behaviour observed in the laboratory was compared to environmental data from the natal stream. Results demonstrated that individual shy-bold behavioural phenotype was consistent before and after a simulated aerial predator attack, indicating consistency of behaviour across situations. Individual preferred and avoidance temperatures varied substantially, but were unrelated to shy-bold behavioural phenotypes. In contrast, individual preferred and maximum avoidance temperatures were significantly reduced in hypoxia, consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis. These findings might indicate suppressed development rates in hypoxia, not only by the limited oxygen for aerobic metabolism, but also by the preference for colder water in hypoxia. Furthermore, the tolerated thermal ranges were reduced in hypoxia. Using test conditions confirmed by field data, our study demonstrates the strong influence of oxygen availability on thermoregulatory behaviours and preferences in aquatic environments.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			0306-4565			WOS:000486107400055	31466789

Despite the widespread occurrence of morphological antipredator mechanisms, no studies have tested how these can affect the sensitivity of prey to pesticides. Sensitivity to pesticides is typically measured via reductions in growth rates and survival, but also reductions in heat tolerance are to be expected and are becoming increasingly important in a warming world. We investigated how autotomy, a widespread morphological antipredator mechanism where animals sacrifice a body part (here the caudal lamellae) to escape when attacked by a predator, modified the sensitivity to the insecticide chlorpyrifos in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. Exposure to chlorpyrifos reduced the growth rate and heat tolerance (measured as CTmax). A key finding was that the pesticide had a greater impact on growth rates of intact animals, i.e. those that retained their lamellae. This reduced sensitivity to chlorpyrifos in animals without lamellae can be explained by the reduced outer surface area which is expected to result in a lower uptake of the pesticide. Larvae that underwent autotomy exhibited a lower heat tolerance, which may also be explained by the reduced surface area and the associated reduction in oxygen uptake. There is a wide diversity of morphological antipredator mechanisms, suggesting that there will be more examples where these mechanisms affect the vulnerability to pollutants. Given the importance of pollution and predation as structuring forces in aquatic food webs, exploring the potential interactions between morphological antipredator mechanisms and sensitivity to pollutants will be crucial for risk assessment of pollutants in aquatic systems.

Often, trees have become the targets of widescale disease and pest outbreaks. Beech bark disease has been successful because of the effectiveness of the scale insect Cryptococcus fagisuga and the opportunistic Nectria coccinea var. faginata fungal vector. Since the severity of beech bark disease negatively affects mast production and canopy turnover, the abundance of small-mammal and insect populations can be limited. We explored the effects of beech bark disease, as well as other abiotic factors, on the diversity of small-mammal and invertebrate populations. We expected that biodiversity would vary according to disease severity in Fagus grandifolia (American Beech) stands, such that higher biodiversity and more seed predators would be noted in healthier forests. At sites in New York and Vermont, Sherman and pitfall traps were used to capture mammals and invertebrates, respectively. Correlations between tree size and disease severity levels were quantified by noting the diameter at breast height (dbh) and by ranking according to disease intensity levels. Although biodiversity indices were not significantly different among sites, there were significant differences in dbh (F = 3.48, P = 0.0154, d.f. = 3) and disease intensity levels (F = 21.13, P < 0.0001, d.f. = 3). Surprisingly in 2008, beechnut seed production was greatest in the Catskill Mountains of New York, the site with the greatest disease manifestation. Mammal richness was highest at the Champlain Valley site where there were fewer Napaeozapus insignius (Woodland Jumping Mice). Patterns of small-mammal abundance at the stand level, elucidated in canonical correspondence analyses, were explained in part by land-use history, soil characteristics, elevation, recent cutting, temperature, and precipitation in 2007. Invertebrate family richness was greatest in the Adirondacks of New York as compared to other sites. At the site level, beechnut density, land-use history, and soil order were the most important variables explaining variation in invertebrate assemblages. Results from this study show that patterns of biodiversity cannot be directly explained by disease and beech mast alone in the short-term. Rather, multi-year community dynamics must be measured.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			1092-6194	1938-5307		WOS:000309507500003

The most prevalent order was Diptera, with 53.6% of total prey; within this order, Sciaridae accounted for 64.7% of prey. The month with the highest values for alpha diversity was July (11 - 1.32). Greatest turnover of orders was June-November and that of families of Diptera was July- Total beta diversity was greater in families of Diptera, with a value of 1.29, while that of orders of arthropods was 0.53.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0038-4909	1943-6262		WOS:000289039400012

Ecology of the invasive New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Hydrobiidae), in a mediterranean-climate stream system								HYDROBIOLOGIA				746	1			375	399		10.1007/s10750-014-2136-6				MAR 2015	2015	The New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is a widely distributed non-native species of management concern on four continents. In a southern California stream, P. antipodarum abundance, which ranged from ca. < 10 to nearly 150,000 snails m(-2), was related to discharge and temperature patterns. Laboratory experiments indicated that P. antipodarum (1) survivorship decreased from 13 to 27A degrees C, but its growth rate was higher at 13 and 20A degrees C than 27A degrees C; (2) grazing rates were similar to those of native algivores in short-term trials; (3) grazing impact was greater than that of a native hydrobiid snail in longer-term trials; (4) ingested different diatom sizes than some other grazers; (5) reduced the abundances of medium-sized and large diatoms, and several filamentous cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, while increasing the relative abundances of tough filamentous chlorophytes (e.g., Cladophora); (6) impact on other grazing invertebrates was species specific, ranging from competition to facilitation; (7) reduced the survivorship of Anaxyrus boreas tadpoles; and (8) was consumed by non-native Procambarus clarkii and naiads of Aeshna and Argia. Ecological effects of introduced P.antipodarum are subtle, occurring primarily at transitory high densities, but flow regulation may enhance their effects by eliminating high flows that reduce their population sizes.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000348186600029

Multiple lines of evidence including isotopic, body shape and swimming modality analyses suggest they exhibited elevated growth and metabolic rates, and body temperatures. However, applications of osteohistological methods to test hypotheses regarding their physiology are few. Previous studies focused on the humeri, vertebrae and ribs from a small number of taxa. Here, we use osteohistological methods to describe the bone microstructure of over 30 cranial and post-cranial elements from a nearly complete, articulated individual of Stenopterygius quadriscissus from the Posidonienschiefer Formation (Posidonia Shale, Lower Jurassic) of Germany. The specimen shows highly vascularized primary bone and spongious secondary bone in its limbs, suggesting an overall shift to a lighter spongious-structured skeleton was achieved through multiple developmental mechanisms. The modified perichondral ossification in elements of the limbs distal to the stylopodium informs our understanding of functional morphology, including hydrodynamic forces on the paddles. The ribs show variation in cortical thickness and trabecular organization along their length. Cyclical growth is inferred from changes in vascularization and osteocyte density as well as the presence of annuli in primary fibrolamellar bone. Cranial elements, due to their relative density and better preservation of growth marks, may prove to be of particular importance in future skeletochronological studies of post-Triassic ichthyosaurians. We infer and corroborate hypotheses of elevated growth rates and metabolic rates in ichthyosaurians, and the potential forthermoregulation similar to extant homeothermic ectotherms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-0239	1475-4983		WOS:000465874700005		
J	Rodrigo, Eugenia; Catala-Oltra, Marta; Perez-Laorga, Eduardo; Baena, Manuel								Monitoring of Matsucoccus feytaudi (Hemiptera: Matsucoccidae) and its natural enemies in Spain using sticky tapes and pheromone traps								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY				110	2			301	310		10.14411/eje.2013.043				2013	2013	The maritime pine bast scale, Matsucoccus feytaudi Ducasse (Hemiptera: Matsucoccidae), occurs in the western part of the Mediterranean basin and is a sap sucking insect that feeds only on maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton). It causes damage in SE France and Italy, where it was accidentally introduced. In Spain information is scarce and, moreover, almost nothing is known about the predators of this species. This study was designed to determine the seasonal trends in abundance of M. feytaudi and its major predators, which might help to improve the biological control of this pest in other areas. Natural P. pinaster stands in the Valencian Community (Spain) were surveyed in 2004. In addition, the seasonal trends in abundance of M. feytaudi and its natural enemies were monitored in three stands over a period of three years (2002, 2005 and 2006). The monitoring was carried by wrapping sticky tapes around tree trunks and using delta traps baited with sexual pheromone. The maritime pine bast scale was detected in all the stands surveyed. At almost all the sites surveyed, three species of predators were captured: Elatophilus nigricornis Zetterstedt (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Hemerobius stigma Stephens (Neuroptera: Hemerobiidae) and Malachiomimus pectinatus (Kiesenwetter) (Coleoptera: Malachiidae). The presence of M. pectinatus is noteworthy as this is the first record of this species as a possible predator of M. feytaudi. The results show that M. feytaudi, although differing in its phenology depending on the location, is univoltine in the study area. The prepupae, pupae and adults of M. feytaudi appeared between December and March in colder areas and between October and February in warmer areas. E. nigricornis nymphs are important predators of M. feytaudi, and were abundant when the scale insect (crawlers, prepupae, pupae, male and female adults) was present. The flight period of E. nigricornis and the hemerobiid H. stigma ranged from May to October. However, these flight patterns did not correlate with the presence of the different stages of the bast scale (crawlers, prepupae, pupae, male and female adults) on the surface of tree trunks. The presence of M. pectinatus in large numbers in some stands suggests it might be an important natural regulator, which helps to keep M. feytaudi populations at low densities in the areas of Spain studied. This malachiid shows a strong kairomonal attraction to the sexual pheromone of M. feytaudi and its flight activity is significantly correlated with the presence of crawlers of bast scale.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3				1802-8829		WOS:000318038400016

As such, it is an important determinant of the potential invasive ability of organisms and may limit population expansion unless organisms can physiologically respond to changes in temperature either through plasticity or by adapting to their novel environment. Here, we studied the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, which has become invasive on a global scale. We compared adults from an invasive population of western France with individuals from two populations in the native range in South Africa. We measured the thermal dependence of locomotor performance in adults given its relevance to dispersal, predator escape, and prey capture. Our results show significant differences in the limits of the 80% performance breadth interval for endurance with the French population showing a left shift in its limits congruent with the colder climate experienced in France. The French invasive population was introduced only about 40years ago suggesting a rapid shift in the thermal physiology. Given that all individuals were acclimated under laboratory conditions at 23 degrees C for 2 months this suggests that the invasive frogs have adapted to their new environment. These data may allow the refinement of physiologically informed species distribution models permitting better estimates of future ranges at risk of invasion.

J	Mitchell, Allegra; Bergmann, Philip J.								Thermal and moisture habitat preferences do not maximize jumping performance in frogs								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				30	5			733	742		10.1111/1365-2435.12535				MAY 2016	2016	1. Amphibians are suffering population declines globally, and understanding how environmental parameters influence their thermal and moisture preferences and performance at various tasks is crucial to understanding how these animals will be influenced by climate change.2. Body temperature and hydration affect organismal performance at many fitness-related tasks. Since amphibians are ectotherms with highly water-permeable skin, environmental temperature and moisture directly affect their body temperature and hydration. Therefore, amphibians should select habitats with the optimal combination of temperature and moisture to perform tasks necessary for survival. However, interactions between environmental temperature and moisture can influence habitat selection and task performance in different and often unpredictable ways, and this has only infrequently been considered.3. We tested for interactions between environmental temperature, moisture and organismal hydration on temperature and moisture preferences and jumping performance in green frogs (Lithobates clamitans) in the laboratory, using thermal and moisture gradients, and high-speed video and force plate data. We then integrated the laboratory experiments with field data.4. In the thermal and moisture gradients, frogs selected environmental conditions that minimized cutaneous evaporative water loss, hydroregulating more stringently than thermoregulating. These results are consistent with frogs in the field, which had highly variable body temperatures, but were always hydrated above 95% of their standard mass. However, conditions that minimized evaporative water loss frequently did not maximize jumping performance because warmer temperatures conferred greater performance.5. The ecology of L. clamitans may explain the discrepancy between their preferences and jumping performance optima because the frogs remain in wet environments that serve as refuges from dehydration. In parts of their range where frogs are subjected to warmer and drier conditions, they are likely to select microhabitats that minimize the risk of dehydration, possibly at the expense of their ability to forage and escape from predators.									19	0	0	0	19	0	19			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000375941800007

Studies of the phlebotomine fauna, feeding habits and natural infection rate by Leishmania contribute to increased understanding of the epidemiological chain of leishmaniases and their vectorial capacity. Collections were performed in Jaciara, state of Mato Grosso from 2010-2013, during which time 2,011 phlebotomines (23 species) were captured (68.70% Lu. cruzi and 20.52% Lutzomyia whitmani). Lu. cruzi females were identified by observing the shapes of the cibarium (a portion of the mouthpart) and spermatheca, from which samples were obtained for polymerase chain reaction to determine the rates of natural infection. Engorged phlebotomines were assessed to identify the blood-meal host by ELISA. A moderate correlation was discovered between the number of Lu. cruzi and the temperature and the minimum rate of infection was 6.10%. Twenty-two females were reactive to the antisera of bird (28%), dog (3.30%) and skunk (1.60%). We conclude that Lu. cruzi and Lu. whitmani have adapted to the urban environment in this region and that Lu. cruzi is the most likely vector of VL in Jaciara. Moreover, maintenance of Leishmania in the environment is likely aided by the presence of birds and domestic and synanthropic animals.									16	0	0	0	15	4	16			0074-0276	1678-8060		WOS:000345430900008	25410993

Lacertid lizards are insectivorous ectotherms whose energy requirements and food consumption rates are relatively much lower. Maximizing the net rate of energy intake (profitability) may, therefore, be just an optional strategy for these small ectotherms. Nevertheless, lacertids exhibit precisely defined patterns of prey selection. They are selective in the sizes of the prey they capture, and mean prey size (but not profitability, counterbalanced by the longer times required for handling the larger prey) is a good predictor of prey selection in most of the species examined. The foraging choices of lacertid lizards represent complex behavioural responses, in which at least the following factors may be involved: (1) time constraints, related to reproductive cycles, that seem to favour time minimization in the breeding season; (2) movement minimization in the postbreeding season; (3) nutrient optimization; (4) predation risk that may force lizards to balance between the conflicting demands of feeding and avoiding danger; and (5) body temperature, whose effects on lizard performance may cause temperature dependent shifts in prey choice and feeding behaviour.									20	1	0	0	17	0	21			0268-0130			WOS:A1995RK05200002

Support for this prediction often comes from short-term studies, or studies conducted in controlled laboratory settings. We examined the effect of long-term experimental warming on an aphid-sagebrush interaction (Obtusicauda coweni and Artemisia tridentata) in natural field plots in the Rocky Mountains. In no year did we find Support for the prediction that warming increased aphid abundance or Population growth. In fact, warming decreased aphid density on sagebrush in one year, tended to decrease aphids in a second year, and had no effect in a third year. In enclosures that excluded predators, warming decreased aphid population growth by an amount consistent with observed field density differences. Warming increased sagebrush carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio and plant size, but there was no significant correlation between these variables and aphid growth or density. In a separate snow-manipulation experiment in unwarmed plots, the timing of snowmelt did not affect aphid density. In conclusion, warming reduced or did not affect aphid density in each of three years, but this effect could not be explained by differences in plant size, bulk C:N ratio, predation, or snowmelt date. Our results suggest that long-term studies within a natural community context may provide counterexamples to the prediction that warming will increase herbivore pressure on plants.									22	0	1	0	21	0	23			0022-8567			WOS:000246784000007		
J	Aubret, Fabien; Tort, Melodie; Sarraude, Tom					Sarraude, Tom/0000-0002-3548-0935			Evolution of alternative foraging tactics driven by water temperature and physiological constraints in an amphibious snake								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				115	2			411	422		10.1111/bij.12520				JUN 2015	2015	Amphibious predatory ectotherms live and forage in two environments (aquatic and terrestrial) that can drastically differ in temperature means and variance across space and time. The locomotor performance of ectotherms is known to be strongly affected by temperature. However, how differences in water temperature may drive the evolution of alternative foraging tactics in amphibious animals remains poorly understood. Fish-eating Viperine snakes Natrix maura occur from high altitude cold water streams to warm shallow lakes, and employ two main feeding strategies: sentinel foraging (underwater sit-and-wait behaviour) and active foraging (fish chasing). Using 272 juvenile snakes we measured: the performance kinetics of diving and swimming in a wide range of water temperatures; basal metabolic levels in relation to body temperature; and the type of foraging mode expressed in water-temperature-acclimated snakes. Individual swimming performances increased with testing temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 degrees C). Apnoea time followed an opposite trend however, plausibly reflecting the fact that oxygen demands are related to the metabolic rate of ectotherms. That is, snake heart rates increased with body temperature. Snakes acclimated to 10 degrees C water mostly displayed sentinel foraging. By contrast, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C water-acclimated snakes were extremely active fish chasers. Individual apnoea times at the various testing temperatures were all correlated; as were individual swimming speeds. There was however no clear relationship between an individual's ability to hold its breath and its ability to swim, suggesting that both performance traits may be the target of different selective pressures. Fast swimming speed and long breath holding abilities are likely key determinants of both foraging success and predatory evasion, although in a context dependent manner. Active swimming foraging is likely to be advantageous in warm water (>20 degrees C), while sentinel foraging appears better suited to cold water (<14 degrees C). The physiological aspects of foraging tactics of amphibious snakes combined with field and laboratory observations support the idea that physiological and environmental constraints may generate shifts in habitat use and associated foraging tactics in amphibious ectotherms. Avenues for further research are discussed.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 411-422.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000353508000013

Diet shifts in Procambarus clarkii								PLOS ONE				12	9					e0183108	10.1371/journal.pone.0183108				SEP 5 2017	2017	In the Mediterranean basin, the globally increasing temperatures are expected to be accompanied by longer heat waves. Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and Fulton's condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed diet were estimated using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15). The results suggest a decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone species and ii) that by altering species' trophic niches, climate change may alter the main impacts of invasive alien species.									13	0	0	0	13	0	13			1932-6203			WOS:000409282800010	28873401

In this study, we used a multi-proxy approach to determine the relative importance of in-lake versus indirect processes on the Holocene development of an oligotrophic lake in SW Greenland (66.99 degrees N, 50.97 degrees W). A C-14 and Pb-210-dated sediment core covering approximately 8500 years BP was analyzed for organic-inorganic carbon content, pigments, diatoms, chironomids, cladocerans, and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18). Relationships among the different proxies and a number of independent controlling variables (Holocene temperature, an isotope-inferred cooling period, and immigration of Betula nana into the catchment) were explored using redundancy analysis (RDA) independent of time. The main ecological trajectories in the lake biota were captured by ordination first axis sample scores (18-32% variance explained). The importance of the arrival of Betula (ca. 6500 years BP) into the catchment was indicated by a series of partial-constrained ordinations, uniquely explaining 12-17% of the variance in chironomids and up to 9% in pigments. Climate influences on lake biota were strongest during a short-lived cooling period (identified by altered stable isotopes) early in the development of the lake when all proxies changed rapidly, although only chironomids had a unique component (8% in a partial-RDA) explained by the cooling event. Holocene climate explained less variance than either catchment changes or biotic relationships. The sediment record at this site indicates the importance of catchment factors for lake development, the complexity of community trends even in relatively simple systems (invertebrates are the top predators in the lake) and the challenges of deriving palaeoclimate inferences from sediment records in low-Arctic freshwater lakes.									76	4	0	0	53	0	81			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000254235500009

J	Ayers, DY; Shine, R				Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008				Thermal influences on foraging ability: Body size, posture and cooling rate of an ambush predator, the python Morelia spilota								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				11	3			342	347		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00093.x				JUN 1997	1997	1. The interface between thermal biology and foraging mode has attracted little scientific attention, but may be crucially important to the biology of ectothermic predators. Slip & Shine (1988c) suggested that the ability of large heavy-bodied snakes to ambush nocturnally active mammals relied on the snakes' control of cooling rates through their thermal inertia (via body size and postural adjustments) and microhabitat selection.2. We tested assumptions underlying this hypothesis, using Diamond Pythons (Morelia s. spilota) from southeastern New South Wales. Our laboratory studies confirmed that larger body sizes and coiled postures significantly retarded cooling rates, and that body temperature affected the snakes' ability to detect potential prey items.3. The magnitude of these effects on cooling rates was great enough to extend the time period substantially over which an adult Diamond Python, lying in ambush in a suitable microhabitat, would be able to detect and capture nocturnally active prey. For example, the times taken for pythons to reach thermal equilibration under our experimental conditions (cooling from 33 to 12 degrees C) were <1 h for hatchling pythons regardless of posture, 1 h for outstretched juveniles, 2 h for coiled juveniles and outstretched adults, and almost 8 h for coiled adults.4. The high rates of cooling of juvenile pythons, even when they are tightly coiled, may force them to rely upon diurnally active prey rather than crepuscular or nocturnal species.									53	3	0	0	55	0	58			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:A1997XF36700010

A palaeohistological analysis suggests ectothermy								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				131	1			154	162		10.1093/biolinnean/blaa081				SEP 2020	2020	Most Notosuchia were active terrestrial predators. A few were semi-aquatic, or were insectivorous, omnivorous or herbivorous. A question relative to their thermometabolism remains to be answered: were Notosuchia warm-blooded? Here we use quantitative bone palaeohistology to answer this question. Two variables were used as proxies to infer thermometabolism: resting metabolic rate and red blood cell dimensions. Resting metabolic rate was inferred using relative primary osteon area and osteocyte size, shape and density. Blood cell dimensions were inferred using harmonic mean canal diameter and minimum canal diameter. All inferences were performed using phylogenetic eigenvector maps. Both sets of analyses suggest that the seven species of Notosuchia sampled in this study were ectotherms. Given that extant Neosuchia (their sister group) are also ectotherms, and that archosaurs were primitively endotherms, parsimony suggests that endothermy may have been lost at the node Metasuchia (Notosuchia-Neosuchia) by the Early Jurassic. Semi-aquatic taxa such as Pepesuchus may have had thermoregulatory strategies similar to those of recent crocodylians, whereas the terrestrial taxa (Araripesuchus, Armadillosuchus, Iberosuchus, Mariliasuchus, Stratiotosuchus) may have been thermoregulators similar to active predatory varanids. Thermal inertia may have contributed to maintaining a stable temperature in large notosuchians such as Baurusuchus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000580983800012

Larvae of this species are facultative predators on other carrion larvae, and are known to reduce populations of the New World fly Cochliomyia macellaria in the laboratory and in certain field situations. In order to identify conditions under which native taxa might avoid interaction with the invader, we examined broad patterns of resource use by capturing postfeeding larvae as they left a carcass. The Calliphorinae were least similar to C. rufifacies since they were able to exploit smaller carrion, showed a peak in density during cold weather while C. rufifacies numbers were low, and occurred much earlier than the invader during succession within a carcass. Phormia regina also was most abundant during cold weather. The Sarcophagidae were able to exploit smaller carcasses than the invader but are likely to encounter it in larger carcasses. C. macellaria was the species most similar to C. rufifacies in carrion use, and probably is reduced in number by the invader wherever they coexist. In contrast to all other taxa, C. rufifacies exited a carcass alone, suggesting that other larvae of the same age were attacked. Manipulation of a conspicuous predator, the ant Solenopsis invicta, revealed a negative effect on numbers of P. regina and C. macellaria.									35	0	0	0	33	1	35			0029-8549			WOS:A1994PJ34100024	28313964

However, cm(body), FMR, and related morphometric traits are strongly correlated phenotypically, making it difficult to identify the causal determinants of flight performance. By experimentally gluing weights that amounted to similar to 15% body weight to a palatable Neotropical butterfly species (Anartia fatima), we tested the effects of altering FMR and repositioning cm(body) on two measures of flight performance: flight speed and the ability to evade capture. We then tested their effects on survival in a natural setting. might performance studies detected no significant differences in airspeed or evasive flight ability among unweighted controls, weighted-loaded butterflies (MIL), and those with cm(body) positioned further posterior (CM). In two mark-release-recapture experiments, survival of treatment groups did not differ, but males survived longer than females. In one experiment, WL and CM butterflies were recaptured more frequently than controls, whereas the probability of recapture for females was higher than that for males in the second experiment. When significant, results for recapture were consistent with a causal relationship between FMR and flight speed. Presumably, a decrease in flight speed was due to a reduction in muscle mass-specific power output in the weighted butterflies. However, the results did not support a relationship between manoeuvrability and cm(body). (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.									46	0	0	0	41	0	46			0024-4066			WOS:000088841700010

Recently,Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat scratch fever, was detected in blood collected from arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) that were captured and released in the large goose colony at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. This bacterium is generally associated with cats and cat fleas, which are absent from Arctic ecosystems. Arctic foxes in this region feed extensively on migratory geese, their eggs, and their goslings. Thus, we hypothesized that a nest flea, Ceratophyllus vagabundus vagabundus(Boheman, 1865), may serve as a vector for transmission of Bartonella spp.Methods: We determined the prevalence ofBartonellaspp. in (i) nest fleas collected from 5 arctic fox dens and (ii) 37 surrounding goose nests, (iii) fleas collected from 20 geese harvested during arrival at the nesting grounds and (iv) blood clots from 57 adult live-captured arctic foxes. A subsample of fleas were identified morphologically asC. v. vagabundus.Remaining fleas were pooled for each nest, den, or host. DNA was extracted from flea pools and blood clots and analyzed with conventional and real-time polymerase chain reactions targeting the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer region.Results: Bartonella henselaewas identified in 43% of pooled flea samples from nests and 40% of pooled flea samples from fox dens.Bartonella vinsonii berkhoffiiwas identified in 30% of pooled flea samples collected from 20 geese. BothB. vinsonii berkhoffii(n = 2) andB. rochalimae(n = 1) were identified in the blood of foxes.Conclusions: We confirm thatB. henselae,B. vinsonii berkhoffiiandB. rochalimaecirculate in the Karrak Lake ecosystem and that nest fleas containB. vinsoniiandB. henselaeDNA, suggesting that this flea may serve as a potential vector for transmission among Arctic wildlife.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1756-3305			WOS:000571913600002	32928287	
J	Su, TY; Mulla, MS								Toxicity and effects of microbial mosquito larvicides and larvicidal oil on the development and fecundity of the tadpole shrimp Triops newberryi (Packard) (Notostraca : Triopsidae)								JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY				30	1			107	114						JUN 2005	2005	Tadpole shrimp (TPS), Triops newberriy (Packard) (Notostraca: Triopsidae), is a predatory agent for immature mosquitoes breeding in aquatic habitats. This biological control agent could be used with other larvicides in mosquito control programs. In order to elucidate compatibility of the TPS and commonly used mosquito larvicides, studies were initiated to investigate effects of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. israelensis (B. t. i.) de Barjac, Bacillus sphaericus Neide and Golden Bear-1111 (R) larvicidal oil on growth, longevity, and fecundity of TPS in laboratory and field. The exposure of TPS to high dosages of B.t.i. and B. sphaericus in the laboratory or in the field did not have significant adverse effects on growth, longevity, and fecundity. These results indicate that TPS are compatible with microbial larvicides and can be used jointly in practical mosquito control programs. The larvicidal oil GB-1111 (R), on the other hand, caused almost 100% mortality within 48 h after treatment in the laboratory even at the low dosage of 0.38 gallons/ac. The impact of oil in the field was less severe, as significant adverse impact on population density was noted at 1 gallon/ac when water temperatures were warmer, or 2 gallons/ac when water temperatures were cooler. Almost 100% mortality within 48 h was noted at 2 gallons/ac when water temperatures were warmer or at 4 gallons/ac when the water temperatures were cooler. These results indicate incompatibility between this larvicidal oil and TPS at the higher rates of the label range, and joint use of TPS and larvicidal oil at dosages of 1-2 gallons/ac or greater, depending on water temperatures, should be avoided.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			1081-1710	1948-7134		WOS:000230216500015	16007963

Previous studies of insects have found predictable variability in stoichiometry, both in relation to body size and trophic mode, at ordinal levels or higher. Our study further examines the evolutionary and ecological lability in these traits by comparing the effects of body size, trophic mode (larval and adult) and larval habitat on the stoichiometry of insects within one order (Diptera). The study also expands on previous work by analyzing trophic mode both at coarse (detritivore, herbivore, predator) and fine (high- vs low- nutrient quality resources within trophic categories) scales and by comparing nutrient stoichiometry in two geographical regions, Sweden and Arizona. As predicted, adults feeding on nectar or pollen had the lowest body N content in the dataset. Additionally, for Diptera with predatory larvae, species low N diets had lower body N content than those with high N diets. However, body N content was not consistently lower for all species with low N resources, as species feeding on plant material were indistinguishable in stoichiometry from predators with high N diets. We suggest that these results emerge because larval resource exploitation is poorly understood in herbivorous Diptera species. Body P content for Swedish Diptera decreased with body size for all trophic modes, and the only difference among trophic modes was that blood feeders had higher P content than other groups. The regional comparison further showed that the allometry of body P content is a labile trait that may vary at regional scales, as there was no allometric scaling of body P content in the Arizona data set, in contrast to the Swedish data set. These results are not easily explained by existing theoretical frameworks, but instead point to a general context-dependence of P stoichiometry, which should now be a focus for future work.									23	0	0	0	23	0	24			0030-1299			WOS:000264785400016

We investigated the role of an inducible defense as a factor that influences the trophic pathway in an aquatic food web. Quantitative information on food web structure in Lake Suwa (a eutrophic lake in Japan) was provided by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses using samples taken during summer and a structural equation model applied to annual monitoring data. As predicted, there was none or only a weak link detected between the prey with induced defenses (Bosmina fatalis) and its invertebrate predator (Leptodora kindtii). The effects of an inducible defense on the trophic links are based mainly on the mortality or population growth rate of organisms using predation, population (or community) level experiments, field data, and model estimates. However, there was no research linking these different data using stable isotope analyses. Our research provides new evidence supporting previous studies by suggesting the importance of the inducible defense in determining food web structure and function.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000345036000002

Here we investigate the effects of temperature on the performance of the turtle feeding apparatus in a defensive context. We measured bite force and the kinematics of snapping in the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina) over a wide range of body temperatures. Bite force performance was thermally insensitive over the broad range of temperatures typically experienced by these turtles in nature. In contrast, neck extension (velocity, acceleration, and deceleration) and jaw movements (velocity, acceleration, and deceleration) showed clear temperature dependence with peak acceleration and deceleration capacity increasing with increasing temperatures. Our results regarding the temperature dependence of defensive behavior are reflected by the ecology and overall behavior of this species. These data illustrate the necessity for carefully controlling T-b when carrying out behavioral and functional studies on turtles as temperature affects the velocity, acceleration, and deceleration of jaw and neck extension movements. More generally, these data add to the limited but increasing number of studies showing that temperature may have important effects on feeding and defensive performance in ectotherms. J. Exp.

Our comparative data on whole-organism performance measured across a range of temperatures and the musculoskeletal morphology of the tongue apparatus were examined in a phylogenetic framework and combined with data on muscle contractile physiology and neural control. Our analysis reveals that relatively minor evolutionary changes in morphology and neural control have transformed a muscle-powered system with modest performance and high thermal sensitivity into a spring-powered system with extreme performance and functional robustness in the face of evolutionarily conserved muscle contractile physiology. Furthermore, these changes have occurred in parallel in both major clades of this largest family of salamanders. We also find that high-performance tongue projection that exceeds available muscle power and thermal robustness of performance coevolve, both being emergent properties of the same elastic-recoil mechanism. Among the taxa examined, we find muscle-powered and fully fledged elastic systems with enormous performance differences, but no intermediate forms, suggesting that incipient elastic mechanisms do not persist in evolutionary time. A growing body of data from other elastic systems suggests that similar coevolution of traits may be found in other ectothermic animals with high performance, particularly those for which thermoregulation is challenging or ecologically costly.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0027-8424			WOS:000532837500046	32341147

Samples were collected from both types of habitats weekly throughout one year, and variables like water surface and vegetation cover were recorded. In permanent ponds, adults of both species were found throughout the study period, while in temporary pools their presence depended on the availability of water. Differences in their reproductive seasons and breeding sites were observed. Enochrus vulgaris was characterized by an opportunistic strategy, and its larvae were detected in both types of habitats, associated mainly with spring and summer temperatures. Conversely, E. variegatus larvae were recorded almost exclusively in temporary pools, during the winter and spring seasons. In permanent ponds, both species were associated with vegetation cover, which could be related to the availability of refuges from fish predators. First instar larvae showed the highest abundance and were captured more frequently, in consecutive weeks and simultaneously with third instar larvae, suggesting that the two populations studied are not synchronized in oviposition time or development of immature stages. In several occasions, second instar larvae of both species were captured in a pool that had been dry during the previous sampling date, suggesting that they had not hatched from fresh laid eggs. Our findings show that adults of these species are capable of dispersal to and from temporary pools to avoid drought. In addition, their larval stages may also be able to resist drought in the pools by burrowing into the substrate.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0716-078X	0717-6317		WOS:000313140100003

Inherent tradeoffs in time and resource allocation should result in differential investment in defense along a resource gradient, but competing models predict different patterns of investment. There are currently insufficient empirical data on changes in investment in defensive traits or their costs along resource gradients to differentiate between the competing allocation models. In this study, I exposed tadpoles to caged predators along a resource gradient in order to estimate investment in defense and costs of defense by assessing predator-induced plasticity. Induced defenses included increased tail depth, reduced feeding, and reduced swimming activity; costs associated with these defenses were reduced developmental rate, reduced growth, and reduced survival. At low resource availability, these costs predominately resulted in reduced survival, while at high resource availability the costs yielded a reduced developmental rate. Defensive traits responded strongly to predation risk, but did not respond to resource availability (with the exception of feeding activity), whereas traits construed as costs of defenses showed the opposite pattern. Therefore, defensive traits were highly sensitive to predation risk, while traits construed as costs of defense were highly sensitive to resource allocation tradeoffs. This difference in sensitivity between the two groups of traits may explain why the correlation between the expression of defensive traits and the expression of the associated defense costs was weak. Furthermore, my results indicate that genetic linkages and mechanistic integration of multiple defensive traits and their associated costs may constrain time and resource allocation in ways that are not addressed in existing models.									43	2	0	0	42	0	44			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000246276200002	17221255

In ectotherms, such as reptiles, the body colour can have direct effects on numerous aspects of their existence, such as thermoregulation or prey-predator interactions. Darker melanic individuals show lower skin reflectance and consequently heat up more rapidly and maintain optimal body temperatures more easily than lighter coloured individuals. As a consequence, melanistic individuals of diurnal species in cool areas may exhibit higher body condition, growth rate, survival and fecundity than lighter coloured individuals. Such advantages of dark coloration may be counterbalanced by a lower crypsis to predators and a decreased foraging efficiency. We investigated, in two montane populations of asp vipers Vipera aspis, the relationship between (1) colour polymorphism and body condition and length and (2) the coloration of individuals and their elevational distribution. We showed significant relationships between (1) the coloration, body condition and sex of individuals; (2) sexes and reproductive state and morph frequency; and (3) colour morphs that were distributed following an elevational gradient. Hence, colour polymorphism plays an important role in the ecology and evolution of the asp viper and is maintained through differential selective pressures.									28	1	0	0	27	0	30			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000321823000005

PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				76	2			676	684		10.1002/ps.5565		AUG 2019		FEB 2020	2020	BACKGROUND Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are a problematic pest in global sweet pepper cultivation. Control of aphids often relies on insecticides, leading to widespread resistance. Biological control of aphids is mainly based on releasing specialist natural enemies, but they often fail to control outbreaks. Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur (Hemiptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophagous generalist which attacks several sweet pepper pests, including aphids. Previous research showed that M. pygmaeus is capable of strongly reducing aphid populations in sweet pepper, but complete control was seldom achieved. Sweet pepper plants continue to grow during the season, reaching > 3 m high in Belgian and Dutch greenhouses. Dense foliage and large vertical distance from the flowers to the lower leaves impede the search efficiency of the predator. Leaf pruning may improve aphid predation by M. pygmaeus by increasing the probability of encountering prey. RESULTS Four and five treatments (foliage range: 100 cm to full length) respectively were tested in a semi-commercial sweet pepper greenhouse in 2017 and 2018. Aphid populations in pruned treatments grew more slowly than in the control and M. pygmaeus was eventually able to control aphids in all pruned treatments in 2018. There was no difference in aphid control between the pruned treatments. Sweet pepper production was lower in the treatments with the shortest foliage lengths. CONCLUSION Leaf pruning up to 160 or 190 cm foliage length improves aphid control by M. pygmaeus in sweet pepper without affecting production.

However, variable mid-temperate and low-latitude winters may interact with scaling of size, metabolism, and energy reserves to cause energy deficits and require trade-offs between foraging and predation. A dynamic optimization model explored how ration, fall fat, and both non- and size-selective predation influenced foraging (i.e., fast or forage) and energy allocation (i.e., length or fat) decisions that maximize winter survival of age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). During a mid-latitude (38degrees N) winter, a pond experiment in which age-0 fish occurred with or without adult conspecific predators tested a subset of the model.In the model without predators, winter foraging occurred, with small size only reducing survival when low ration and low fall fat caused small fish to exhaust reserves. With predation, all sizes foraged to maintain mass and fat reserves when ration was sufficiently high, with small fish also growing in length. When modeled predation was nonselective, size-dependent mortality varied in complex ways. In contrast, size-selective predators consistently reduced survival of small fish. Generally consistent with the model, fish in ponds without predators gained mass and energy content, while those with predators only maintained these parameters. All small individuals grew more than large counterparts in length. Mortality in ponds never depended on size but was similar to20% higher with predators. Energy deficits often demand active foraging during mid-temperate winters, with predation rather than energy depletion influencing size-dependent survival.									67	1	0	0	64	1	68			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000224844700025

Worldwide more than 160 species of natural enemies are associated with this pest, and an important challenge is to quickly find an effective biocontrol agent from this pool of candidate species. Evaluation criteria for control agents are presented, with the advantages they offer for separating potentially useful natural enemies from less promising ones. Next, an aggregate parameter for ranking agents is proposed: the pest kill rate k(m). We explain why the predator's intrinsic rate of increase cannot be used for comparing the control potential of predators or pa rasitoids, while k(m) can be used to compare both types of natural enemies. As an example, kill rates for males, females and both sexes combined of three Neotropical mirid species (Campyloneuropsis infumatus (Carvalho), Engytatus varians (Distant) and Macrolophus basicornis (Stal)) were determined, taking all life-history data (developmental times, survival rates, total nymphal and adult predation, sex ratios and adult lifespan) into account. Based on the value for the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) for T. absoluta and for the kill rate k(m) of the predators, we predict that all three predators are potentially able to control the pest, because their k(m) values are all higher than the r(m) of the pest. Using only k m values, we conclude that E. varians is the best candidate for control of T. absoluta on tomato, with C. infumatus ranking second and M. basicornis last.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000511385200011	30968782

The effect of grazing on invertebrates is rarely quantified, but results from limited studies of terrestrial and coastal grasslands demonstrate greater abundance and species richness in un-grazed grassland. 2.The impact of short sward (<8cm) cattle grazing on the ground dwelling invertebrate community was assessed on an English inter-tidal upper salt marsh using pitfall traps. Abundance, species richness, functional group structure, abundance of coastal specialists, environmental factors that influence invertebrate habitat choice and food web composition were compared for grazed and un-grazed marsh. 3.In total, 90000 invertebrates were sampled. Predatory, zoophagus and detritivorous Coleoptera were significantly more abundant on the un-grazed marsh. In contrast, predatory Hemiptera and Araneae were significantly more abundant on the grazed marsh. Sheet weaver spiders were significantly more abundant on the grazed marsh, foliage running hunters and space web builders more abundant on the un-grazed marsh. Most inter-tidal coastal specialist species exhibited clear habitat preference for the grazed marsh. Total species richness was not significantly different between grazing treatments. 4.Linear direct gradient analysis showed that two environmental variables influenced by grazing intensity, soil temperature and vegetation height, significantly explained the composition of invertebrate functional groups. Larger bodied invertebrates dominated the un-grazed food web. 5.We conclude that both short sward cattle grazed and un-grazed saltmarsh habitat should be maintained to maximise invertebrate abundance and diversity and provide suitable habitat for coastal specialists.									39	1	0	0	36	0	41			1752-458X	1752-4598		WOS:000316326300010

Plant carnivory has attracted much interest since Darwin's time, but many fundamental properties of the carnivorous lifestyle are largely unexplored. In particular, the chain of events leading from prey perception to its digestive utilization remains to be elucidated. One of the first steps after the capture of animal prey, i.e. the enzymatic breakup of the insects' chitin-based shell, is reflected by considerable chitinase activity in the secreted digestive fluid in the carnivorous plant Venus flytrap. This study addresses the molecular nature, function, and regulation of the underlying enzyme, VF chitinase-I. Using mass spectrometry based de novo sequencing, VF chitinase-I was identified in the secreted fluid. As anticipated for one of the most prominent proteins in the flytrap's "green stomach" during prey digestion, transcription of VF chitinase-I is restricted to glands and enhanced by secretion-inducing stimuli. In their natural habitat, Venus flytrap is exposed to high temperatures. We expressed and purified recombinant VF chitinase-I and show that the enzyme exhibits the hallmark properties expected from an enzyme active in the hot and acidic digestive fluid of Dionaea muscipula. Structural modeling revealed a relative compact globular form of VF chitinase-I, which might contribute to its overall stability and resistance to proteolysis. These peculiar characteristics could well serve industrial purposes, especially because of the ability to hydrolyze both soluble and crystalline chitin substrates including the commercially important cleavage of alpha-chitin.

J	Elliott, J. M.								Inter- and intra-specific differences in the number of larval instars in British populations of 24 species of stoneflies (Plecoptera)								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				54	6			1271	1284		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02176.x				JUN 2009	2009	1. Ontogenetic changes during the life cycle of aquatic insects are important not only in life-history studies but also in evaluating food-web structure. They require information on the growth and number of larval instars but such information is lacking for many species, including Plecoptera. Therefore, the chief objectives of the present study were to determine inter- and intra-specific differences in the number of larval instars in British populations of 24 species of stoneflies, to test Dyar's hypothesis that growth followed a geometric progression, and to synthesise this information with previously published values for four British species.2. Larvae were reared at constant temperatures in the laboratory from eggs from 63 populations (one to six populations per species). First instars from each population were divided into three batches and each batch was reared at one of three constant temperatures. For each species, the rearing temperature and source population had no significant effect on the mean size of each larval instar.3. The relationship between the geometric mean length of each instar and instar number was well described by an exponential equation (P < 0.001, r(2) > 0.9 for all species), thus supporting Dyar's hypothesis. Only one species, Brachyptera risi, had the same number of instars for males and females (12-13). For the other 15 herbivorous species and the four smaller carnivorous ones, the number of instars was higher for females than males (range 11-16 for males, 12-17 for females). The larger size of the females was due to their additional instars, not a sex difference in growth rates. In contrast, there was a clear growth separation of the sexes after the 9th or 10th instar for the four largest carnivores. The number of larval instars was highest for these four species (range 16-19 for males, 18-23 for females), and females were much larger than males.4. A multiple regression equation with data from the present and previous studies (n = 27) showed that variability in the mean length of the first instar and the maximum number of larval instars for each species accounted for 88% and 91% of the variability in the mean length of the final instar for males and females, respectively.5. Values for Plecoptera in other countries were in general agreement with those in the present study, especially in the same families. Two old, but widely quoted, high values are doubtful. The present study and four previous ones provide a sound basis for ontogenetic studies on 28 species of Plecoptera and their role in aquatic ecosystems.									5	0	0	0	6	1	6			0046-5070			WOS:000265934700010		
J	Nyffeler, M; Sunderland, KD								Composition, abundance and pest control potential of spider communities in agroecosystems: a comparison of European and US studies								AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT				95	2-3			579	612	PII S0167-8809(02)00181-0	10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00181-0				MAY 2003	2003	Current knowledge of spiders in agroecosystems (excluding tree crops),reported in European and US literature is discussed comparatively, in an attempt to relate spider community structure to pest control potential.The spider fauna of agroecosystems in the northern-temperate zone of Europe is strongly dominated by small linyphiid spiders that capture tiny insects in their sheet webs, including large numbers of pest aphids. In the US, spider guild structure is more complex, and hunters (especially, Oxyopidae, Salticidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae, and Lycosidae), that have broader diets (including lepidopteran and heteropteran pests), numerically prevail in many locations. Spider populations increase to high densities (2-600 m(-2)) in European field crops, but densities are typically much lower (0.02-14 m(-2)) in US annual crops. Agroecosystem spiders, in both Europe and the US, feed rather infrequently, but they contribute to pest control as part of larger assemblages of natural enemies, and there is potential for increasing. their density and impact in both continents.Many of the differences between continents in spider guild structure, density and feeding patterns highlighted in this paper are likely to be attributable to climatic differences. Most of the US data originate from more southern latitudes (i.e., subtropical and Mediterranean climates) with distinctly higher mean annual temperatures compared to the European study areas, which are in the northern-temperate zone. Spider communities may respond-to climate directly, and also indirectly via food availability and antagonists. In addition, differences in crop structure and cultural practices (including habitat diversification and the provision of ground cover) could influence spider density and community organisation. Mean farm size is an order of magnitude less in Europe than in the US and this is likely to be associated with greater habitat diversity, which is known to increase spider abundance.Currently, there is a dearth of field studies from southern Europe (Mediterranean climate) and the northern regions of the US (humid continental climate). The few data available from such regions indicate that the patterns of spider predation may differ less between the two continents if sufficient study areas with similar climatic conditions could be compared. The conclusions in terms of biological control are, however, widely applicable, because a large proportion of the productive agricultural land area of Europe is located in more northern latitudes and the reverse is true in the US.

The goals of this study were to measure and explain large-scale spatial and temporal patterns of phenotypic variation in size at metamorphosis of the mayfly, Baetis bicaudatus (Baetidae), from habitats with variable levels of predation risk. Within a single high-elevation watershed in western Colorado, USA, from 1994 to 1996 we measured dry masses of mature larvae of the overwintering and summer generations of Baetis at 28 site-years in streams with and without predatory fish (trout). We also estimated larval growth rates and development times at 16 site-years. Patterns of spatial variation in mayfly size could not be explained by resource (algae) standing stock, competitor densities, or physical-chemical variables. However, size at metamorphosis of males and females of summer generation Baetis was smaller in fish streams than in fishless streams and decreased as densities of predatory stoneflies increased. Furthermore, overwintering individuals matured at larger sizes than summer generation Baetis, and the size of emerging Baetis declined over the summer, but predominantly in trout streams. Theoretical consideration of the effect of predation risk on size and timing of metamorphosis accurately predicted the observed temporal variation in size and timing of mayflies at emergence in fish and fishless streams. Baetis populations had similar growth rates but followed different developmental trajectories in high and low risk environments. In risky environments larval development was accelerated, resulting in metamorphosis of younger and smaller individuals, minimizing exposure of larvae to risk of mortality from trout predation, but at the cost of future reproduction. In safe environments, larvae extended their development, resulting in larger, more fecund adults, Thus, we propose that large-scale patterns of variation in size and timing of metamorphosis represent adaptive phenotypic plasticity, whereby mayflies respond to variation in risk of predation, thereby maximizing their fitness in variable environments.									154	4	0	0	158	2	164			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000167138200011

Ciliate vertical distribution and diel vertical migration in a eutrophic lake								FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY				171	1			1	14		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0171-0001				2008	2008	The diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviour of a heterotrophic ciliate community was monitored in a eutrophic gravel pit lake located near the lower Rhine in Germany. The purpose of the study was to determine whether DVM in ciliates occurred, if this behaviour was species-specific, and to examine factors (predator avoidance, location of prey, temperature and oxygen regimes) that could drive this behaviour. Day and night samples were taken monthly from March to October 2002. Ciliates and algae were sampled every meter and zooplankton every 2 m, from 0 to 14 in. At the same time, physico-chemical parameters (temperature, O-2 and chlorophyll-a) were measured. Results show that the ciliates do perform vertical migration, but this could not be tied to differences in the diel distributions of potential zooplankton predators of ciliates. Of the putative ciliate predators, only Chaoborus performed vertical migrations, making it difficult to associate ciliate migration behaviour with predator avoidance.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1863-9135			WOS:000254977300001

The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87% are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 +/- 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle-stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 +/- 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.									405	2	0	0	363	0	406			0027-8424			WOS:000292251000046	21606358

It occurs in large rivers draining to the northern Gulf of Mexico chiefly through Alabama and Mississippi. Collections over a 12-month period from the Pearl and Pascagoula rivers, Mississippi, were taken to document the new species' life history characteristics. Female C. meridionalis had significantly greater wet weight (WW, kg) per given total length (TL, mm) (WW = 4.228(-13) TL4.588) than males (WW = 2.000(-9) TL3.237). Aged opercular bones indicated that one annulus formed during September-October at the beginning of the reproductive season. Fish ages in the sample ranged from 6 to 31 years for females and from 4 to 33 years for males. Longevity of C. meridionalis is markedly greater than previous scale aging of C. elongatus had suggested. Male C. meridionalis as small as 327 mm TL (age 4) and females as small as 444 mm TL (age li)had visibly developed gonads; mean gonadosomatic index was elevated in both sexes between October and March and declined by early April. Spawning began in February to early March when the temperature exceeded 13-14 degrees C. The sex ratio was not different from 1:1 (P > 0.05). Cycleptus meridionalis foraged on aquatic insect larval stages; trichopteran larvae and pupae, chironomid larvae and pupae, and coleopteran larvae were the most common prey items regardless of sex, size, or river. These life history characteristics and food habits are similar to those reported for C. elongatus in the Mississippi River drainage. Our observations indicate that C. meridionalis is viable in both rivers sampled but may be influenced by future river modification as has happened with C. elongatus, which is threatened or endangered over much of its range.									18	0	0	0	17	2	18			0002-8487			WOS:000089183900012

The reproduction of the central European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), which usually deposits its larvae in first-order streams, in small pool and pond-like habitats, is an example of a recent local adaptation in this species. Here we aimed to quantify the direct and indirect effects of the predatory larvae on the aquatic food webs in the ponds and on the flux of matter between the ponds and adjacent terrestrial habitats. Our estimates are based on biomass data of the present pond fauna as well as on the analysis of stomach content data, growth rates and population dynamics of the salamander larvae in pond habitats. By their deposition of larvae in early spring, female fire salamanders import between 0.07 and 2.86 g dry mass m(-2) larval biomass into the ponds. Due to high mortality rates in the larval phase and the relatively small size at metamorphosis of the pond-adapted salamanders compared to stream-adapted ones, the biomass export of the metamorphosed salamanders clearly falls below the initial biomass import. Catastrophic events such as high water temperatures and low oxygen levels may even occasionally result in mass mortalities of salamander larvae and thus in a net 100 % import of the salamander biomass into the pond food webs. Indirect effects further accelerate this net import of matter into the aquatic habitat, e.g. the feeding of salamanders on aquatic insect larvae with the emergence of terrestrial adults-thus preventing export-and on terrestrial organisms that fall on the water surface (supporting import). This study demonstrates that the adaptation of salamanders to pond reproduction can alter food web linkages across ecosystem boundaries by enhancing the flux of materials and energy from terrestrial (i.e. forest) to the aquatic (i.e. pond) habitat.									39	1	0	0	36	0	39			0029-8549			WOS:000323504300026	23358795

Infection is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, and several domestic and wild mammals act as reservoirs for the infection, so the prompt detection of infected hosts is crucial to preventing and controlling the spread of the disease and its transmission to humans. A rapid and portable tool for VL diagnosis based on the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technology is described herein. The device exploits a highly specific chimeric recombinant antigen as the recognition element for capturing anti-leishmanial antibodies, and protein A labelled with gold nanoparticles as the signal reporter. The LFIA shows excellent diagnostic sensitivity (98.4%), specificity (98.9%), and agreement with serological reference methods for diagnosing canine VL. The long-term stability of the LFIA device was confirmed based on six months of storage at room temperature or 4 A degrees C, and the qualitative response of the device was not affected by limited thermal stress. The use of the broadly specific protein A means that the LFIA can be readily adapted to diagnose VL in dogs (the main reservoir for human infection) and other mammals, thus further assisting efforts to control the spread of VL.									11	1	0	0	4	0	11			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000435776400016	29687248

Comparison between the two species is based on measurements at 15-degrees-C, but a group of C. lavaretus was also monitored at 10-degrees-C.The intensity of routine oxygen consumption was mass-independent in the smallest larvae, but above about 10 mg wet body mass (m) it scaled with an allometry of m-0.103 in C. lavaretus and m-0.154 in E. lucius. Routine, minimum and maximum rates of metabolism were higher in C. lavaretus than in E. lucius, whereas the mass-specific rate induced by feeding showed a quite different and more complex relationship to species.The mass-specific rate of growth scaled with m-0.133 (r=0.54) in C. lavaretus but with m-0.24 (r=0.90) in E. lucius.Comparison of five experimental groups, differing from each other with respect to species, type of prey (Artemia nauplii or Rutilus rutilus larvae), experimental temperature and body size, suggested a general pattern of energy partitioning, with 62+/-3.7% of metabolizable food energy being allocated to growth, and 38+/-3.7% to metabolic expenditures.The relationship between metabolic rate and growth rate, expressed as the 'yield ratio', mg dry body mass mu-mol-1 O2, the inverse of the net cost of growth, proved to be nearly invariant in all experimental groups, namely 0.043 mg mu-mol-1. However, two experiments with the smallest pike larvae led to higher growth rates per metabolic expenditure, suggesting that in E. lucius oxygen consumption may reach an aerobic maximum for growth at a routine rate of about 200-220 mu-mol O2 g-1 dry body mass h-1.Gross costs of growth include mass-dependent maintenance expenditures. Expressed in mass-independent units, E. lucius was more efficient in converting food energy into growth than was C. lavaretus; its superiority in this respect ranged from 7 to 17% depending on body mass and diet.The results are discussed with regard to the question of whether in small poikilothermic metazoans the allocation of metabolic energy follows the rules of addition or compensation. Furthermore, growth performance of the fish larvae is compared with that of microorganisms on the basis of the 'yield ATP' concept.									13	0	0	0	10	0	13			0022-0949			WOS:A1992JK67200010

In the last few years, the disease expanded to medium- and large-sized cities, in which surveillance and control actions have been intensified, in an effort to control VL spreading. Our two-year study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, the sixth most populous city in Brazil, which is endemic for VL. We focused in two particular districts of recent transmission of the disease, with no reported human cases and submitted to minor surveillance and control actions. Our aim was to draw an epidemiological profile of the local situation concerning Lutzomyia vector, Leishmania parasites, and the main domestic reservoirs (dogs). Lutzomyia longipalpis comprised 96.5% of the total phlebotomine sand flies captured and displayed an expressive minimal infection rate by Leishmania infantum (16.7%). Positive correlations were found between the population densities of L. longipalpis, rainfall and temperature. L infantum was also detected in the cortelezzii complex and, for the first time, in Lutzomyia lloydi. Leishmania braziliensis, an etiological agent of the American cutaneous leishmaniasis, was also identified in L longipalpis. Among the 1408 dogs serologically tested by standard enzyme-linked and fluorescence immune assays (ELISA/IFA) 3.6% were positive for VL. L. infantum DNA and Leishmania parasites were identified in 100% and 72.5% of the seropositive dogs, respectively. The co-positivity of other diagnostic tests for VL Leishmania-nested PCR, imprint and myeloculture-was compared to the standard serology. Both symptomatic or asymptomatic dogs displayed an equal average number of positive diagnostic tests for VL. The districts studied display favorable conditions for the rapid spreading of human infection, in terms of L longipalpis population density, and presence of L. infantum in both vector and main reservoir.

We used life table data and a matrix projection model to incorporate combinations of mortality (lethal effect) and reductions in fecundity (sublethal effect) into estimates of intrinsic population growth rates (r) for a predator, the seven-spot lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., and its prey, the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, and an aphid parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh). All three species exhibited differences in key life history variables. The aphid had the highest r and shortest generation time, the ladybeetle had the lowest r and longest generation, while the parasitoid exhibited intermediate life history characteristics. When the model was run with populations started as neonates (aphids) or eggs (lady beetle, parasitoid) for each species, ladybeetle populations were much more susceptible than either aphid or parasitoid populations 30 days after simulated exposure to a pesticide. For example, 50% mortality and a 50% reduction in fecundity resulted in a population headed toward extinction (negative r) for the ladybeetle while the parasitoid population grew exponentially (positive r) even after sustaining 70% mortality and a 70% reduction in fecundity. The aphid species maintained exponential growth after sustaining 80% mortality and an 80% reduction in fecundity. Thus, differences in life history variables accounted for the greater susceptibility of the ladybeetle to a pesticide than its aphid prey or the parasitoid over a set time interval. These differences in susceptibility were greatly reduced when the model was run starting with a mixed age/stage population (the stable age distribution) for each species indicating that population structure at the time of pesticide exposure plays a critical role in population susceptibility. These results suggest that life history attributes as well as population structure at the time of pesticide exposure both play a major role in population susceptibility to pesticides, highlighting the need to explicitly consider differences in life history variables among species when calculating compatibility of pesticides and biological control agents as well as the population structure of beneficial species at the time of pesticide application.

However, as the start of the growing season often varies substantially across years, adaptive parental effects on juvenile developmental rates may mediate the costs of a delayed season. By employing a meta-analysis, we tested whether larval developmental rates across a latitudinal cline of the common frog (Rana temporaria) are affected by fluctuating onsets of breeding, across years. We predicted that larval developmental rate will be inversely related to the onset of breeding, and that northern populations will be more prone to shorten their developmental rate in response to late breeding, as the costs of delayed metamorphosis should be highest in areas with a shorter growing season. We found that the larval period of both northern and southern populations responded to parental environmental conditions to a similar degree in absolute terms, but in different directions. In northern populations, a late season start correlated with decreased development time, suggesting that the evolution of parental effects aids population persistence in time-constrained environments. In southern populations, late season start correlated with increased development time, which could potentially be explained as a predator avoidance strategy. Our findings suggest that local ecological variables can induce adaptive parental effects, but responses are complex, and likely trade-off with other ecological factors.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000524961900001	32277360	
J	Naef-Daenzer, B; Keller, LF					Lukas, Keller/0000-0002-0149-0174			The foraging performance of great and blue tits (Parus major and P-caerulens) in relation to caterpillar development, and its consequences for nestling growth and fledging weight								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				68	4			708	718		10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00318.x				JUL 1999	1999	1. We analysed the effect of prey density and size on the foraging performance of great and blue tit (Parus major L., P. caeruleus L.) parents, and its consequences for the growth and fledging weight of nestlings. Because fledging weight is a determinant of subsequent survival and therefore fitness, foraging decisions of the parents play a key role in the reproductive system of tits. The analysis quantifies (i) the rate at which energy is delivered to the nestlings in relation to prey size and abundance, and (ii) the growth rates of nestlings and the resulting fledging weight in relation to the rate of food delivery by the parents.2. The searching time per prey item increased exponentially with decreasing prey biomass. During the peak abundance of caterpillars, the average searching time per item was 2.5-3 min instead of 5-6 min before and after the peak. Searching time was significantly reduced when the birds returned to the foraging site where the preceding prey was found. This accords with the clumped distribution of caterpillars within the canopy.3. The foraging performance (in mg caterpillars per min) was maximal when caterpillars were both abundant and large, i.e. shortly before they left the trees for pupation. The high feeding frequency and the large prey then caused a peak energy flow rate to the nestlings of 4-5 times the rate before or after the caterpillar peak. This suggests that the foraging success and rate of food delivery by tit parents was primarily determined by the abundance and size of prey.4. The growth rate of nestlings, as well as their fledging weight was correlated with the rate of food delivery. Low feeding performance of the parents resulted therefore in poor relative growth rates of only 0.3-0.6 of the rate achieved under optimal conditions and, as a consequence, in a low fledging weight. This indicates that tit parents have restricted options to adjust prey delivery rates according to the requirements of the brood.5. The results give insight into the chain of causal mechanisms through which an environmental factor (availability of food) has a strong and immediate effect on fitness (growth, fledging weight and, thus, survival of the nestlings). The importance of caterpillar size for foraging success and prey delivery rates of parent tits makes clear, why the phase of best foraging conditions is shorter than the period during which caterpillars are available. The relationships we quantified give a proximate explanation for the great effects that temperature and caterpillar growth have on the between-year variation in selection intensity for laying date observed in other studies.									200	2	0	0	197	0	208			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000081723300006

We examined variation in BMR within the New World bat family Phyllostomidae, which shows the largest diversity of food habits among mammalian families, including frugivorous, nectarivorous, insectivorous, carnivorous and blood-eating species. For 27 species, diet was taken from the literature and BMR was either measured on animals captured in Brazil or extracted from the Literature. Conventional (nonphylogenetic) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with body mass as the covariate, was first used to test the effects of diet on BMR. In this analysis, which assumes that all species evolved simultaneously from a single ancestor (i.e., a "star" phylogeny), diet exerted a strong effect on mass-independent BMR: nectarivorous bats showed higher mass-independent BMR than other bats feeding on fruits, insects or blood. In phylogenetic ANCOVAs via Monte Carlo computer simulation, which assume that species are part of a branching hierarchical phylogeny, no statistically significant effect of diet on BMR was observed. Hence, results of the nonphylogenetic analysis were misleading because the critical values for testing the effect of diet were underestimated. However, in this sample of bats, diet is perfectly confounded with phylogeny, because the four dietary categories represent four separate subclades, which greatly reduces statistical power to detect a diet (= subclade) effect. But even if diet did appear to exert an influence on BMR in this sample of bats, it would not be logically possible to separate this effect from the possibility that the dietary categories differ for some other reason (i.e., another synapomorphy of one or more of the subclades). Examples such as this highlight the importance of considering phylogenetic relationships when designing new comparative studies, as well as when analyzing existing data sets. We also discuss some possible reasons why BMR may not coadapt with diet.									63	4	0	0	65	1	68			0944-2006			WOS:000169227800006	16351818

JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY				77	4			399	403		10.1111/j.1557-9263.2006.00070.x				FAL 2006	2006	Many temperate-zone birds must track seasonal variation in food availability to time breeding and enhance reproductive success. However, the external cues birds use to fine-tune sexual development and timing of reproduction remain unclear. One possibility is that birds may use chemical substances it, plants and bud tissues as a reliable predictor of leaf flush and the appearance of caterpillars, the preferred prey of many insectivorous birds during the breeding season. However, few data on seasonal shifts in key plant material consumption are available. To test this hypothesis, we examined the gizzard contents of Corsican Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), a small passerine bird with a breeding schedule tightly linked to the phenology of oak trees. We quantified and compared the consumption of tree buds by birds captured during winter (nonbreeding) and early spring (prebreeding), and found that bud use by Blue Tits was limited and constant through time. Fewer than 30% of birds had buds in their gizzards during the critical prebreeding period, and these items represented less than 1% of gizzard contents. It is unlikely that this limited use of buds allowed birds to track a potential chemical signal at the time of reproductive decision making. Unless more data on the consumption of plant material become available, we suggest that other environmental factors be examined to help identify the cues used by temperate-zone birds to time their reproduction.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0273-8570	1557-9263		WOS:000242441900007

In Europe, the geographic ranges of many species were confined to a few, mostly southern refugia during periods of full glaciation. Distribution ranges then reexpanded, and uninhabited northern areas were recolonized during the interglacials. These con traction-expansion cycles were repeated at least four times. Paleontological and molecular phylogeographic studies during the last decade have greatly increased our knowledge of refugial areas and postglacial recolonization patterns of European trees, shrubs and Alpine plants since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. Much less is known yet about non-Alpine herbaceous plants. In the present review, we summarize recent phylogeographic work on halophytic (salt-adapted) plants from coastal and inland habitats in Europe. Major refugial areas for these plants have been identified along the Mediterranean coasts, but some species could also have survived in saline inland localities. In general, recolonization of N and NW Europe occurred in a stepwise fashion along the Atlantic coastline. For a number of species, molecular studies revealed concordant genetic discontinuities on the background of an essentially continuous geographic distribution. Such congruency could be explained by the preferential seed dispersal through sea currents. However, phylogeographic patterns of halophytes also proved to be influenced by other factors like sea-level fluctuations during the Pleistocene, secondary contact between divergent lineages, long-distance dispersal, clonal growth, and special habitat and temperature requirements.

The main aim of this study was to compare the general trophic patterns with respect to continental populations of Northern Grey Shrike (Lanius excubitor) and Southern Grey Shrike. The material analysed consisted in 440 pellets collected during the four seasons of the year in the period April 2003-March 2004. A total of 5,112 prey items were identified, 85.4% corresponding to beetles (mainly Curculionidae and Tenebrionidae) and the rest consisted of other arthropods and vertebrates. Biomass mainly constituted of vertebrates, especially lizards (64.0%). Slight seasonal variations in diet were recorded, beetles and lizards being highly consumed in all seasons. A positive selection of some beetles, non-Formicidae Hymenoptera and Orthoptera (Schistocerca gregaria) was observed. The data obtained in the present study confirms the hypothesis of how the Southern Grey Shrike relies on cold-blooded prey in hot climate (e.g. south of France), while the Great Grey Shrike mainly relies on warm-blooded prey in cold climate (e.g. Scandinavian Peninsula). The importance of lizards in the diet of this insular shrike population could be related to three different ecological factors: (1) the high abundance of these ectotherm vertebrates in island environments, (2) the higher effectiveness of predation and (3) lower investment of energy to capture them.									17	0	0	0	14	0	21			0030-5685			WOS:000234595000004

Based on life table studies, it has been proposed that the growth of aphid populations could be modeled with an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time. This model has never been tested under field conditions.2 The soybean aphid Aphis glycines is a new invasive pest to soybean production in the U.S.A. In the present study, we present five datasets on the growth of colonies of A. glycines, monitored during population growth and decline under predator-free conditions in three soybean fields, from 2003 to 2006.3 We demonstrate that an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time, gives a much better description of A. glycines dynamics for all datasets (R-2 = 0.94-0.99) than the exponential (R-2 = 0.42-0.98) or logistic growth models (R-2 = 0.77-0.99). Furthermore, it is shown by cross-validation that the exponential model with decreasing r can be used to make population predictions, as shown by the coefficient of prediction, R-pred(2) ranging from 0.55 to 0.97. An improved proved fit of the model was obtained using both aphid (R-pred(2) > 0.79) and soybean pred (R-pred(2) > 0.86) degree-days scales, indicating temperature effects on the phenological time scale for the decrease in r.4 Our model suggests important bottom-up control of A. glycines population growth, which may interact with other mortality factors. The generality and potential applications of these results are discussed.									31	0	0	0	28	0	31			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000250631600006

Currently, the most frequently explored hypotheses regarding the evolution and function of complex signaling focus on the signal and/or signaler, or the signaling environment, while much less attention has been placed on the receivers. However, recent studies using vertebrates suggest that receiver psychology (e. g. learning and memory) may play a large role in the evolution of complex signaling. To date, the influence of multimodal cues on receiver learning and/or memory has not been studied in invertebrates. Here, we test the hypothesis that the presence of a seismic (vibratory) stimulus improves color discrimination learning in the jumping spider Habronattus dossenus. Using a heat-aversion learning experiment, we found evidence for a cross-modal effect on color learning. Over a series of training trials, individuals exposed to a seismic stimulus jumped onto the heated color less frequently and remained there for less time than did individuals not exposed to a seismic stimulus.

We used a standardized sampling procedure in the bioclimatically diverse Murcia Region in Spain and multilevel regression models for count data to estimate P. perniciosus abundance in relation to environmental and anthropic factors.Methods: Twenty-five dog and sheep premises were sampled for sand flies using adhesive and light-attraction traps, from late May to early October 2015. Temperature, relative humidity and other animal-and premise-related data recorded on site and other environmental data were extracted from digital databases using a geographical information system. The relationship between sand fly abundance and explanatory variables was analysed using binomial regression models.Results: The total number of sand flies captured, mostly with light-attraction traps, was 3,644 specimens, including 80% P. perniciosus, the main L. infantum vector in Spain. Abundance varied between and within zones and was positively associated with increasing altitude from 0 to 900 m above sea level, except from 500 to 700 m where it was low. Populations peaked in July and especially during a 3-day heat wave when relative humidity and wind speed plummeted. Regression models indicated that climate and not land use or soil characteristics have the greatest impact on this species density on a large geographical scale. In contrast, micro-environmental factors such as animal building characteristics and husbandry practices affect sand fly population size on a smaller scale.Conclusions: A standardised sampling procedure and statistical analysis for highly overdispersed distributions allow reliable estimation of P. perniciosus abundance and identification of environmental drivers. While climatic variables have the greatest impact at macro-environmental scale, anthropic factors may be determinant at a microgeographical scale. These finding may be used to elaborate predictive distribution maps useful for vector and pathogen control programs.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			1756-3305			WOS:000399419800001	28420407

(Lepidoptera: Pieridae)								FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY				7						96	10.3389/fphys.2016.00096				MAR 15 2016	2016	The current study deals with a digestive a-amylase in the larvae of Pieris brassicae L. through purification, enzymatic characterization, gene expression, and in vivo effect of a specific inhibitor, Acarbose. Although a-amylase activity was the highest in the whole gut homogenate of larvae but compartmentalization of amylolytic activity showed an equal activity in posterior midgut (PM) and anterior midgut (AM). A three step purification using ammonium sulfate, Sepharyl G-100 and DEAF-Cellulose Fast flow revealed an enzyme with a specific activity of 5.18 U/mg, recovery of 13.20, purification fold of 19.25 and molecular weight of 88 kDa. The purified alpha-amylase had the highest activity at optimal pH and temperature of 8 and 35 degrees C. Also, the enzyme had V-max values of 4.64 and 3.02 U/mg protein and K-m values of 1.37 and 1.74% using starch and glycogen as substrates, respectively. Different concentrations of acarbose, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether) N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid significantly decreased activity of the purified alpha-amylase. The 4th instar larvae of P brassicae were fed on the treated leaves of Raphanus sativus L. with 0.22 mM of Acarbose to find in vivo effects on nutritional indices, alpha-amylase activity, and gene expression. The significant differences were only found in conversion efficiency of digested food, relative growth rate, and metabolic cost of control and fed larvae on Acarbose. Also, amylolytic activity significantly decreased in the treated larvae by both biochemical and native-PAGE experiments. Results of RT-PCR revealed a gene with 621 bp length responsible for alpha-amylase expression that had 75% identity with Papilio xuthus and P polytes. Finally, qRT-PCR revealed higher expression of alpha-amylase in control larvae compared to acarbose-fed ones.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			1664-042X			WOS:000371863600002	27014094

A total of 143 frogs were collected, measured, sexed, and dissected, to assess stomach contents. The anurans were grouped into three age classes and four categories (considering sex and capture date). The trophic amplitude for each age class and sex-season category was quantified using Shannon-Weaver Index, and the trophic niche overlap between ages and categories by using the Pianka Index. Comparisons among treatments were made by G-tests. The most important prey items were coleopterans (IRI = 2547), and significant correlations were found between predator and prey sizes. The major differences on diet composition were found between extreme age classes (froglets and adults). Significant differences were also detected between sexes in the cold season but not in the warm season. Any of these changes in diet may be related with the availability of prey.									46	0	1	0	51	13	61			1678-4766			SCIELO:S0073-47212004000100010

Here, we used automated image-based tracking to characterize the exploratory (voluntary) speed of 173 invertebrates comprising 57 species across six taxonomic groups (Arachnida, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Entognatha, Insecta, Malacostraca) and four feeding types (carnivore, detritivore, herbivore, omnivore). Across all individuals, exploratory speed (mm/s) scaled with body mass (g) following a power-law relationship with a scaling exponent of 0.19 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SE) and an intercept of 14.33 +/- 1.2. These parameters varied substantially with taxonomic group and feeding type. For the first time, we provide general empirically derived allometric scaling relationships of exploratory speed across broad taxonomic groups of invertebrates. As exploratory speed drives key components of species interactions, such as encounter and attack rates, or competition, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of individual movement in population and community level processes.									19	0	0	0	16	0	17			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000414242600002	28887816

Sampling was conducted using pitfall traps over a two year period. Studied peat bog has a history of drastically decrease in area during the last five decades mainly due to the process of natural succession and changes in the water level. A total of 389 isopod individuals belonging to 8 species were captured. Species richness did not significantly differ between bog, edge and surrounding forest. High species richness at the bog is most likely the result of progressive vegetation succession, small size of the bog and interspecific relationships, such as predation. With spreading of Molinia grass on the peat bog, upper layers of Sphagnum mosses become less humid and probably more suitable for forest species that slowly colonise bog area. The highest diversity was found at the edge mainly due to the edge effect and seasonal immigration, but also possibly due to high abundance and predator pressure of the Myrmica ants and lycosid spiders at the bog site. The most abundant species were Trachelipus rathkii and Protracheoniscus politus, in the bog area and in the forest, respectively. Bog specific species were not recorded and the majority of the species collected belong to the group of tyrphoneutral species, However, Hyloniscus adonis could be considered as a tyrphoxenous species regarding its habitat preferences. Most of collected isopod species are widespread eutytopic species that usually inhabit various habitats and therefore indicate negative successive changes or degradation processes in the peat bog.									10	0	0	0	12	0	13			1313-2989	1313-2970		WOS:000304582600014	22536107

The biological control agent Gratiana boliviana Spaeth (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is providing adequate control of TSA stands in South and Central Florida. However, poor or no establishment of this agent has occurred in northern Florida. The goal of this study was to examine the mortality factors that influence the population dynamics of G. boliviana in Florida. Horizontal life tables were constructed by following cohorts of individuals in the laboratory and inside closed and open cages at field sites in Central and North Florida. Fertility life table parameters were estimated using laboratory and field data. In addition, as part of a vertical life table analysis, TSA plants were sampled every two weeks in pastures in Central Florida, and counts of all G. boliviana and other herbivores and predators were recorded. Survival to adulthood was similar between Central and North Florida (open cages: 12-19%). Intrinsic mortality (laboratory data) and biotic factors (predation) together accounted for 75% of the mortality of immature stages. Survival of beetles in a natural population determined from vertical life tables was 5%. A complex of three mirid species (Engytatus modesta Distant, Tupiocoris notatus Distant, and Macrolophus sp.) were the most abundant predators found in the field, and are known to feed on G. boliviana eggs and larvae. Positive growth rates (r(m) = 0.3) during the summer and early fall allow the beetle population to increase and provide suppression of TSA in Central Florida. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Cook, Timothee R.; Brischoux, Francois								Why does the only 'planktonic tetrapod' dive? Determinants of diving behaviour in a marine ectotherm								ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				98				113	123		10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.018				DEC 2014	2014	Marine tetrapods represent powerful models for studying how evolutionary transitions shape the life history traits, physiology and behaviour of animals. Whereas adaptations to diving are driven primarily by the need to secure underwater food, diving in the pelagic sea snake, Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus, seems less foraging-dependent. Indeed, this reptile captures fish while floating at the sea surface. Despite knowledge about its surface ecology, its underwater behaviour remains mostly unknown. Yet, study of this life phase is a key to understanding how and why this snake dives. In this study, we reanalysed published data on its diving behaviour. The pelagic sea snake spends 95% of its time underwater, where it can dive to 50 m and stay for 3.5 h without breathing. Dives are S-shaped, with a long phase of gradual ascent during which the snake is neutrally buoyant. Snake lungs deflate slowly during this phase at a rate that increases with water temperature, and thus metabolism. Dive duration is linked to inferred lung volume at the start of the dive, suggesting aerobic diving. We propose that pelagic sea snakes dive for multiple reasons, but primarily to avoid sea surface turbulence. Underwater, they can reduce metabolism by targeting cooler water layers. By hovering in the water column, they reduce energy expenditure and escape both surface and bottom predators, while more easily locating their own prey from underneath. Some marine turtles occasionally display S-shaped dives, but the role of such dives remains under debate. We suggest the study of sea snakes can help interpret diving behaviour in other lineages of marine reptiles. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fecal analysis supported a largely insectivorous diet, with small vertebrates and carrion representing minor alternative resources. Almost all invertebrate prey was significantly more abundant in the warm period than the cold period, whereas skunk diet did not vary seasonally. Even though Molina's hog-nosed skunks were considered to be opportunistic foragers due to their wide trophic niche, our results indicate that despite their trophic generalism, they consumed several prey items in proportions differing from those expected by their respective availabilities.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0025-1461	1864-1547		WOS:000344624200006

Bite force capacities may be tightly linked to both the type and magnitude of the ecological challenges of food acquisition, mate acquisition, and antipredation in vertebrates. In the present study, we present technical details on bite meters and on measuring bite forces. The ability to take reliable measurements depends on specific features of the measuring device and on where in the mouth the bite is applied. Using both previously available and original data, we demonstrate several ecologically and evolutionarily relevant features of bite force measurements. First, maximal bite forces are repeatable among individuals across all vertebrates studied to date. Second, in ectotherms such as lizards, maximal bite forces are affected by body temperature and motivational states. Third, bite forces are strongly correlated with head size and shape. Fourth, bite forces correlate with features of prey of vertebrates. Finally, bite forces are linked to male dominance and correlated with social-display structures. Thus, bite force performance measures can be used as 'traits', and thus be used in integrative studies at multiple levels of organismal biology. Accordingly, bite force data will help our understanding of the functions, capacities, and evolution of jaw-cranial musculoskeletal systems. Moreover, a plethora of opportunities exist for the use of bite force measurements, and if methods are carefully applied, several levels of organismal and ecological organization can be integrated to aid our understanding of the ecology and evolution of vertebrate taxa.

Most models of vegetation change predict either the response of a patch of present vegetation to climatic change or the future equilibrium distribution of vegetation based on the present relationship between climate and vegetation. Here we present a model that is, to our knowledge, the first model of ecosystem change in response to transient changes in climate, disturbance regime, and recruitment over the next 50-500 yr. The frame-based model uses quantitative and qualitative variables to develop scenarios of vegetation change from arctic tundra to boreal forest in response to global changes in climate (as predicted by general circulation models [GCMs]), fire, and land use. Seed availability, tree growth rate, and probability of fire were the model parameters that most strongly influenced the balance between tundra and boreal forest in transitional climates. The rate of climatic warming strongly affected the time lag between the onset of climate change and the simulated ecosystem response but had relatively little effect on the rate or pattern of ecosystem change. The model calculated that, with a gradual ramped change of 3 degrees C in the next century (corresponding to average rate of warming predicted by GCMs), any change from tundra to forest would take 150 yr, consistent with pollen records. The model suggested that tundra would first be invaded by conifer forests, but that the proportion of broad-leaved deciduous forest would increase, reflecting increased fire frequency, as climatic warming continued. The change in fire frequency was determined more strongly by climatically driven changes in vegetation than by direct climatic effects on fire probability. The pattern of climatic warming was more important than the rate of warming or change in precipitation in determining the rate of conversion from tundra to forest. Increased climatic variability promoted ecosystem change, particularly when oscillations were long relative to the time required for tree maturation. Management policies related to logging and moose-predator control affected vegetation as much or more than did changes in climate and must be included in future scenarios of global changes in ecosystem distribution. We suggest that frame-based models provide a critical link between patch and equilibrium models in predicting ecosystem change in response to transient changes in climate over the coming decades to centuries.									100	0	0	0	63	0	103			1051-0761			WOS:A1996UZ41200030

One factor affecting the magnitude of the lift force is the area of the propulsor. Resistance to cruising and sprints is mainly due to drag, but inertia is important during maneuvers when animals accelerate or turn. The inertia of the body and entrained water, which is proportional to body volume, resists acceleration. Because a thrust that is proportional to surface area is used to maneuver a resistance that is proportional to volume, acceleration performance and maneuverability are expected to decline with increasing size. This trend is ameliorated to some extent by the high swimming speeds attainable by warm-bodied vertebrates and the reduced resistance to acceleration characteristic of the skeletons of dolphins and ichthyosaurs. Maneuvers are essential for capture of elusive prey and avoidance of predators. As they increase in size, aquatic vertebrates use various means to ensure that their prey are less maneuverable than they. These include consumption of increasingly smaller prey relative to predator body size (culminating in filter feeding by the largest aquatic vertebrates); behaviors to concentrate, disturb, and disorient prey; and ambushing or suction feeding that avoid whole-body acceleration. Advantages of warm muscles are seen in the ability of endotherms to take more maneuverable prey than can ectotherms of teh same size. Young stages of large aquatic vertebrates could be especially vulnerable to predators; viviparity or spawning in productive patches provides for rapid growth through vulnerable stages.									74	0	0	0	65	0	75			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:A1990EQ37000008

The movement of food through the alimentary tract (gastric motility) of banded archerfish, Toxotes jaculatrix (Pallas, 1767), was observed in the laboratory under natural conditions of temperature (27 degrees C) and salinity (28) using X-radiography, with barium sulphate (BaSO4) as an inert food marker. Nutrient absorption along the alimentary tract (expressed as relative percentage absorption gradient) was calculated using the apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) based on ash contents of adjacent samples. We found that initial voiding of fecal matter began 6-12 hrs after feeding commenced, and that alimentary tracts were completely emptied within 96 hrs. Considerable proportions of all macronutrients were absorbed in the short region (anterior intestine/pyloric caeca), but active absorption continued along the longer middle and posterior intestinal segments. The macronutrient in wild-fed T. jaculatrix differed (51% protein, 63% lipid, 20% carbohydrate, and 40% energy) from that of laboratory-fed fish (75% protein, 96% lipid, 50% carbohydrate, and 87% energy), due to the fact that the proximate contents of macronutriet in the wild-fed fish were unknown, while the diet of the laboratory-fed fish was initially known. Gut passage times in T. jaculatrix was longer than those reported in various temperate carnivorous fishes, which is surprising given the higher temperatures in the tropics, however, all previous studies were performed on cultured fish fed commercial pellets and therefore direct comparisons are not possible. Slow gut passage may depend on the types of food ingested (e.g., high chitinous mealworm) that correlated to lower food consumption. Our results generally indicated that T. jaculatrix is opportunistic feeders regardless of the macronutrient content of the prey.									12	1	0	0	4	0	12			0007-4977	1553-6955		WOS:000343356900002

Why then, is it so hard to detect performance trade-offs at the whole-organismal level? Why do we sometimes even obtain positive correlations between two performance traits that are predicted to be negatively associated? Here we explore two plausible explanations. First, most analyses are based on individual maximal values (i.e., personal best), which could introduce a bias in the correlation estimates. Second, phenotypic correlations alone may be poor indicators of a trade-off when contrasting processes occur at the among-versus within-individual levels. One such scenario is the "big houses big cars" model developed in life-history theory to explain the existence of "uberfleas" that are superior in all regards (because they acquire more resources than others). We highlight that the exact opposite scenario might occur for performance trade-offs, where among-individual trade-offs may be masked by within-individual changes in physical condition. One of the best ways to test among these alternative scenarios is to collect repeated pairs of performance traits and analyze them using multivariate mixed models (MMMs). MMMs allow straightforward and simultaneous examination of trait correlations at the among-and within-individual levels. We use a simple simulation tool (SQuID package in R) to create a population of Krakens, a mythical giant squid-like sea creature whose morphology generates a performance trade-off between swimming speed and strength or ability to sink ships. The simulations showed that using individual maximum values introduces a bias that is particularly severe when individuals differ in the number of repeated samples (n(trial)). Finally, we show how MMMs can help detect performance (or any other type of) trade-offs and offer additional insights (e.g., help detect plasticity integration). We hope researchers will adopt MMMs when exploring trade-offs in whole-animal performances.

We tested the allometry of longevity in squamates and the tuatara, and determined how longevity is related to key environmental characteristics and life-history traits. Predictions based on life-history theory are expected to hold true for ectotherms, similarly to mammals and birds.LocationWorld-wide.MethodsWe assembled from the literature a dataset of the maximum longevities of more than a thousand squamate species, representing c. 10% of their known species diversity, their phylogenetic relationships and multiple life-history and ecological variables. Correcting for phylogeny, we modelled the link between squamate longevity and both key life-history traits, such as body mass and age at first reproduction, and important environmental factors, such as latitude and primary productivity within species distributional ranges.ResultsLarge-bodied species live for longer than small ones, but body size explains far less of the variance in longevity than it does in mammals and birds. Accounting for body size, squamate brood frequency is negatively correlated with longevity, while age at first reproduction is positively correlated with longevity. This points to a continuum of slow-to-fast life-history strategies. Squamates in high latitudes and cold regions live for longer, probably because a shorter season of activity translates to slower development, older age at first reproduction and hence to increased longevity. Individuals live longer in captivity than in the wild. Herbivorous and omnivorous squamates live for longer than carnivorous ones. We postulate that low-quality nutrition reduces growth rates, promotes a relative decline in reproductive rates and thus prolongs life.Main conclusionsOur results support key predictions from life-history theory and suggest that reproducing more slowly and at older ages, being herbivorous and, plausibly, lowering metabolism, result in increased longevity.									45	0	0	0	45	0	46			1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000350997800002

Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				100	10			1301	1314		10.1007/s10641-017-0643-9				OCT 2017	2017	Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014-15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin's niche breadth, and Manly's index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000412840700011

DIAPAUSE IN THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF STINK BUGS (HETEROPTERA, PENTATOMIDAE) FROM THE TEMPERATE ZONE]				ДИАПАУЗА В СЕЗОННОМ ЦИКЛЕ ЩИТНИКОВ (HETEROPTERA, PENTATOMIDAE) УМЕРЕННОГО ПОЯСА				Entomological Review	Энтомологическое обозрение			90	4			740	774						2011	2011	For the first time in the world literature, this paper reviews the data on diapause and related phenomena in stink bugs (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). The family includes about 4700 species (i. e. more than 10 % of the described world Heteroptera fauna). Using stink bugs as examples, the consecutive stages of the complex dynamic process of diapause (such as diapause preparation, induction, initiation, maintenance, termination, post-diapause quiescence, and resumption of direct development) are described and discussed. Out of 43 pentatomid species studied in relation to diapause in the Temperate Zone up to date, the majority (38 species) overwinter as adults, two species - as eggs, and another two species - as nymphs. <i>Pentatoma rufipes </i>is believed to be able to overwinter at different stages of its life cycle. Less than 5% of pentatomid species are probably able to overwinter twice. Only five species have obligate diapause, others have the facultative one. Day-length and temperature are the main diapause inducing factors in the majority of species. The role of food in the control of seasonal development is essential in the pentatomid species feeding on plant seeds. In different species, different stages are sensitive to day-length. Some pentatomids retain sensitivity to photoperiod even after diapause, others lose it and become photo-refractory (temporarily or permanently). In the pentatomid family, such seasonal adaptations as photoperiodic control of nymphal growth rates, seasonal body colour change, migrations, and summer diapause (aestivation) are widely represented, whereas wing and/or wing muscle polymorphism has not been reported yet. Species from the subfamily Podopinae overwinter in adult diapause and induction of facultative reproductive winter is under the control of photoperiod and temperature. All of these species feed on seeds and their seasonal development to a great extent reflects availability of food. However, the same food preferences and pattern of seasonal development are characteristic to many species from the subfamily Pentatominae (in particular, to most members of the tribe Aeliini). All species of the subfamily Asopinae are predators. Among them, <i>Picromerus bidens </i>and <i>Apateticus cynicus </i>have obligate embryonic (egg) winter diapause, which is rear among true bugs, although these two species belong to different tribes (Platinopini and Amyoteini, respectively). At the same time, <i>A. cynicus </i>and <i>Podisus maculiventris </i>belong to the same tribe (Amyoteini) but have different types of diapause: obligate embryonic diapause in <i>A. cynicus </i>and facultative adult diapause in <i>P. maculiventris. </i>Other Asopinae species studied up to date have facultative adult diapause controlled by photoperiod and temperature. Probably, there is only one exception: in <i>Andrallus spinidens, </i>adult diapause is controlled by temperature, and photoperiod plays only a secondary role. Thus, in spite of the similar habits and feeding types among Asopinae (all of them are predators), the species within this subfamily have different types of diapause and the latter is controlled by different factors. In the subfamily Pentatominae, on the contrary, most of the species overwinter as adults and induction of their diapause is controlled the long-day type photoperiodic response, in spite of the differences in their feeding preferences (within phytophagy). However, there are some exceptions in this subfamily, too: <i>Palomena prasina, P. angulosa </i>and <i>Menida scotti </i>have obligate diapause, which conditions univoltinism in these pentatomids. In <i>M. scotti, </i>only females have obligate adult diapause, whereas males remain physiologically active through the whole winter, this pattern being unusual for Heteroptera. The presence of <i>Pentatoma rufipes </i>with obligate nymphal diapause and <i>Nezara viridula </i>with facultative adult diapause in the same tribe Pentatomini seems unexpected. Among all studied species in the tribe Aeliini, only <i>Aelia rostrata </i>has obligate adult diapause. The univoltine seasonal cycle of this species with summer diapause (aestivation) and apparent migrations is similar to that of shield bugs (Scutelleridae). According to the analysis of seasonal development, the evolution of seasonal adaptations in Pentatomidae does not directly reflect their phylogeny. However, individual genera (e. g., <i>Palomena </i>with obligate diapause and photoperiodic control of nymphal growth rates or <i>Euschistus </i>with photoperiodic control of coloration), small tribes (such as Aeliini) or even subfamilies (Podopinae) have similar complexes of seasonal adaptations. At the same time, Pentatominae is a large and apparently collected taxon, but most of species in this subfamily have the same facultative adult diapause. In general, in spite of the intensive studies of seasonal adaptations in Pentatomidae and other Heteroptera families during the recent decades, diapause and ecological mechanisms of its regulation are still studied in less than 1 % of described pentatomid species.			Обзор содержит первое в мировой литературе обобщение материалов по диапаузе и сопряженным с ней явлениям в семействе щитников (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), насчитывающем около 4700 видов (более 10 % мировой фауны полужесткокрылых насекомых). На примере щит-ников рассмотрены последовательные этапы диапаузы (как сложного динамического процесса), состоящие в подготовке к диапаузе, ее индукции, становлении, развитии, реактивации, постдиапаузном оцепенении и возобновлении активного развития. Из 43 видов щитников, исследованных в отношении диапаузы в зоне умеренного климата, подавляющее большинство (38 видов) зимуют на стадии имаго, два вида зимуют на стадии яйца и два вида - на стадии личинки. Вероятно, только <i>Pentatoma rufipes </i>способен зимовать на разных стадиях жизненного цикла. Не более 5 % видов, возможно, способно зимовать дважды. Лишьу5изизученных видов диапауза облигатная, у остальных она факультативная. Основными факторами, индуцирующими диапаузу у большинства видов, являются длина дня и температура. У щитников, питающихся семенами, в регуляции сезонного развития велика роль пищи. Чувствительность к длине дня у разных видов приурочена к разным стадиям, при этом у одних видов она сохраняется и после диапаузы, у других в процессе диапаузно-го развития наступает временная или постоянная фоторефрактерность. В семействе широко представлена фотопериодическая регуляция скорости роста личинок, сезонное изменение окраски, миграции и летняя диапауза, но пока не известен полиморфизм крыльев или крыловой мускулатуры. Подсем. Podopinae объединяет виды, зимующие в состоянии имагинальной диапаузы, наступление которой регулируется длиной дня и температурой. Все они питаются содержимым семян, и характер их сезонного развития во многом определяется доступностью корма. Однако такой же тип питания и характер сезонного развития свойствен многим видам подсем. Pen-tatominae (в частности большинству представителей трибы Aeliini). Все виды подсем. Asopinae - хищники, два из них, <i>Picromerus bidens </i>и <i>Apateticus cynicus, </i>имеют редко встречающуюся у полужесткокрылых облигатную диапаузу на эмбриональной стадии. Виды эти относятся к разным трибам: <i>P. bidens </i>относится к Platinopini, а <i>A. cynicus </i>- к Amyoteini. В то же время включенные в одну трибу <i>A. cynicus </i>и <i>Podisus maculiventris </i>имеют различные типы диапаузы: облигатная эмбриональная диапауза - у первого вида и факультативная имагинальная - у второго. Для остальных исследованных видов этого подсемейства характерна факультативная имагинальная диапауза, контролируемая длиной дня и температурой. Исключение составляет только <i>Andrallus spinidens, </i>имагинальная диапауза которого регулируется температурой, а реакция на длину дня, возможно, имеет второстепенное значение. Таким образом, несмотря на сходный образ жизни и режим питания видов подсемейства Asopinae (все они хищники), диапауза у них приурочена к различным стадиям, и ее наступление определяется разными факторами. Большинство представителей подсем. Pentatominae, наоборот, несмотря на разнообразие типов питания в пределах фитофагии, зимуют на имагинальной стадии, и наступление диапа-узы них регулируется длиннодневной фотопериодической реакцией. Но и здесь есть отдельные виды с облигатной диапаузой, определяющей моновольтинизм, например <i>Palomena prasina, Palomena angulosa </i>и <i>Menida scotti. </i>У последнего обнаружена необычная особенность: обли-гатную репродуктивную диапаузу имеют только самки, а самцы остаются физиологически активными в течение всей зимовки. Неожиданным кажется сосуществование <i>Pentatoma rufi-pes </i>с облигатной личиночной диапаузой и <i>Nezara viridula </i>с факультативной имагинальной диапаузой в одной трибе Pentatomini. В трибе Aelini среди исследованных видов лишь у <i>Aelia rostrata </i>обнаружена облигатная имагинальная диапауза, а моновольтинный сезонный цикл с эстивацией и выраженными сезонными миграциями вполне идентичен сезонному развитию клопов-черепашек (сем. Scutelleridae). Эволюция сезонных адаптаций у щитников, согласно результатам анализа их сезонного развития, не является непосредственным отражением эволюции филогенетической, но в пределах отдельных родов (например, <i>Palomena </i>с облигатной диапаузой и фотопериодической регуляцией скорости роста личинок или <i>Euschistus </i>c фотопериодически регулируемыми цветовыми формами) и небольших триб (как Aeliini) или даже подсемейств (Podopinae) появляются однотипные комплексы сезонных адаптаций. Наряду с этим существует большое подсемейство Pentatominae, представляющее собой явно сборную, но достаточно однообразную по типу диапаузы - факультативной имагинальной - у большинства входящих в него видов, группу. В целом, несмотря на интенсивное исследование сезонных адаптаций пентатомид и других семейств полужесткокрылых в последние десятилетия, доля видов, изученных в отношении диапаузы и экологических механизмов еt регуляции, остается ничтожной и пока не достигает даже1%отобщего количества известных видов щитников						2	0	3	0	5	0	5			0367-1445			RSCI:17103009		
J	Zilio, Felipe								Diet of Falco sparverius Linnaeus 1758 (Aves: Falconidae) and Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782) (Aves: Strigidae) in a dune region on north coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil								REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA				14	4			379	392						DEC 2006	2006	Diet of Falco sparverius Linnaeus 1758 (Aves: Falconidae) and Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782) (Aves: Strigidae) in a dune region on north coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Falco sparverius (American Kestrel) and Athene cunicularia (Burrowing Owl) are two, usually sympatric, raptors found in Rio Grande do Sul. Both inhabit open habitats from Alaska and Canada to Tierra del Fuego. Both have similar diets, being generalists that feed on a wide range of prey that includes more invertebrates than vertebrates. The goal of this study is to compare the trophic characteristics of kestrels and owls in the north coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The study area includes grasslands, sand dunes and urban areas. From March/2000 to January/2002, 329 kestrel and 577 owl pellets were collected. Prey remains and capture attempts were also recorded. Diet composition of both species was similar. Invertebrates account for 98.5% of the diet for F. sparverius and 95.1% for A. cunicularia. Orthoptera (50.6%), Araneae (17.1%) and Coleoptera (10.5%) were the main prey eaten by F. sparverius, while Orthoptera (49.8%), Coleoptera (22.4%) and Hymenoptera (11.5%) were the main ones for A. cunicularia,. Among vertebrates, A. cunicularia took mainly Anura (3%) and Reptillia (0.9%), while F. sparverius fed on Aves (0.9%) and Anura (0.8%). Invertebrates were found in 100% of pellets of both raptors, while vertebrates were found only in 31.9% of the kestrel and 76% of the owl pellets. The spring diet of kestrels was distinct from other seasons, while summer and winter owl diets were the most distinct. The seasonality suggested by correspondence analysis is supported by the frequencies of the main prey taken along the year. Both raptors took Coleoptera in warm seasons (summer and spring) rather than cold seasons, whereas the opposite is true for Orthoptera. Hymenoptera and Araneae are common in owl pellets during the winter and spring, while kestrels took more spiders during the summer, and Hymenoptera in spring. Trophic niche overlap was high (67%), varying among seasons.									10	0	0	0	15	4	15			0103-5657			WOS:000208352700006		
J	Ohlberger, Jan				Ohlberger, Jan/H-3262-2019	Ohlberger, Jan/0000-0001-6795-240X			Climate warming and ectotherm body size - from individual physiology to community ecology								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				27	4	SI		991	1001		10.1111/1365-2435.12098				AUG 2013	2013	1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services.2. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate.3. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems.4. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feed-backs at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems.5. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels.6. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.									128	2	0	0	110	1	129			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000329303900016

The aims of the study were to document changes in diet, growth, condition and habitat use between the wet and dry seasons of northern Australia, in light of recent research examining seasonal variation in the physiology of this species. Frillneck lizards feed on a diverse range of invertebrates in both seasons, even though there is a substantial reduction in food availability in the dry season. Harvester termites from the genus Drepanotermes constitute a major component of the diet, and the prevalence of termites in the diet of sedentary foragers in a tropical environment is unusual. Adult male body condition remained relatively stable throughout the year, but females experienced considerable variation. These differences are attributed to different reproductive roles of the sexes. Growth in C. kingii was restricted to the wet season, when food availability was high, and growth was minimal in the dry season when food availability was low The method used in catching lizards was an important factor in determining seasonal habitat use. Telemetered lizards selected a significantly different distribution of tree species than was randomly available, and they selected significantly larger tree species during the dry season. Lizards spotted along roadsides showed little seasonal variation in the selection of tree species or tree sizes. The results suggest a comprehensive change in the ecology of this species, in response to an annual cycle of low food and moisture availability, followed by a period with few resource restrictions.									57	0	0	0	56	3	60			0029-8549			WOS:A1996UF57900005	28307155

However, these habitats are highly threatened by anthropogenic activities, such as land-use changes, the introduction of exotic species, and global warming. Further understanding on the spatiotemporal use of wetlands and their surrounding areas by migrating birds is essential to predict how these changes might affect avian en route ecology. We selected a habitat-generalist passerine, the Bluethroat Luscinia svecica, as model of how migratory birds exploit a highly anthropogenic river basin in southwestern France (i.e. Barthes de la Nive) during autumn migration. We captured and radiotracked 29 young Bluethroats in this region to shed light on different aspects of their stopover ecology and behavior such as stopover duration, habitat selection, and home-range size. We also characterized Bluethroat diet and arthropod availability in different habitats. Bluethroats positively selected pure or mixed reed beds (associated with sedge), hydrophilous tall grasslands, and corn crops. Birds staying more than one day, 8.4 days on average, used preferably corn crops. Home-range sizes were on average 5.8 ha (fixed kernels K95) and high-occupancy area (K50) was 1.36 ha with large individual variation. Bluethroats stopping over with low fuel loads tended to have larger home ranges and used preferentially corn crops, wet, or mesotrophic grasslands and rural paths. Reed beds were typically used as roosting habitat for the majority of birds, being on average 397 m apart from their daytime core areas. Short-staying birds tended to show higher fuel loads and restricted their activities to a smaller home range (1 ha) in pure and mixed reed beds. The diet of Bluethroats was dominated by ants, spiders, and beetles that were particularly abundant in corn crops. The use of corn crops by autumn-migrating Bluethroats in our study site seems to be a reasonable solution in a highly altered environment. Reducing the use of insecticides in these crops and delaying the harvesting time after mid-October are two supplemental measures that, together with a good management of the remaining wetland patches, could greatly favor Bluethroats and other migratory species in this region.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2193-7192	2193-7206		WOS:000511854700008		
J	Thoren, LM; Karlsson, PS				Karlsson, Staffan/J-3082-2012	Karlsson, Staffan/0000-0002-5739-5213			Effects of supplementary feeding on growth and reproduction of three carnivorous plant species in a subarctic environment								JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				86	3			501	510		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00276.x				JUN 1998	1998	1 The effect of supplementary feeding on growth and reproduction of three carnivorous plants species was investigated over a 6-year period. Pinguicula alpina, P. villosa and P. vulgaris populations growing at two altitudes in a subarctic environment were fed with fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster).2 Fed plants increased in size relative to control plants during the first years. Subsequently a stable size difference between feeding levels was established. The weight of the over-wintering part was higher in fed plants than in control plants.3 The flowering frequency (i.e. proportion of plants in a population carrying flowers) was also higher in the fed plants. The proportion of flowering plants increased in the feeding treatment compared to control plants during more-or-less the whole experimental feeding period (5-6 years). Seed production also increased slowly in response to feeding.4 No feeding effect on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in seeds and overwintering parts was found.5 In most characteristics the high-altitude populations were less responsive than populations growing at low altitude. In the high-altitude population reproduction failed repeatedly, suggesting that seed output may be more dependent on abiotic factors than on resource availability in cold environments.6 Pinguicula villosa and P. vulgaris used the new resources the same summer for increased leaf rosette growth and current reproduction, showing these species to be income breeders, while the third species (P. alpina) allocated a larger proportion to storage and future reproduction, characteristic of a capital breeder.									33	0	0	0	32	0	34			0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000074841200012

Nevertheless it is rarely detected in cats (0.8%) from the same state. Dogs are the primary source of infection to mosquitoes, because cats either do not demonstrate microfilaremia or it is too low and transient for transmission. A mosquito survey was conducted in Itacoatiara, Niteroi, from March 1995 to February 1996, using canine, feline and human baits. A total of 21 mosquito species (3,888 females) was collected and biting frequency was highest at dusk. The four species collected most frequently (88.9%) were: Aedes taeniorhynchus (30% of the total catch; with the peak in May/June); Culex quinquefasciatus (22.5%; August/October); Aedes scapularis (19.4%; August, October/November and January) and Cutex declarator (17%; November/January). Human baits were attractive to these species and dogs were significantly more attractive to them than cats. Ae. taeniorhynchus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. scapularis, Cx. declarator and Cx. nigripalpus are the most likely mosquito species to transmit Dirofilaria immitis parasites to dogs and may transmit the parasite to humans. It is also suggested that the vector to cats belongs to the genus Culex.									24	0	0	0	21	4	26			0074-0276			WOS:000072569200002	9698883

Fishes with 15.0 +/- 1.0 cm and of 38.5 +/- 8.2 g were allotted to six 250 L aquaria each, with five juveniles/aquarium. A completely randomized design with three treatments and two replicates was used. The used feeding levels were 2.0; 4.0 and 6.0% BW of rations per day. The juveniles were fed with commercial extruded diets (42.0% CP), at 8: 00 a. m. and 1:00 p.m.. At the end of 45 days, survival, apparent feed conversion ratio, biomass gain, average daily gain and length gain were evaluated. No effects on survival, biomass gain, average daily gain and length gain were observed. There was difference for apparent feed conversion as a function of the adopted management. The best performance results were observed for fish fed 2 and 4% BW of ration daily. The best feeding level for "trairao" juvenile is 4 % BW.									10	0	0	0	8	4	11			1806-9290			WOS:000256956700002
