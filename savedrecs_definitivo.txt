While separate responses to each of these factors are well understood, their joint effects on individual life histories and population dynamics remain largely unexplored. Current theory predicts that the magnitude of prey behavioural, physiological, and life history responses to predation risk should diminish with warming due to the reduced metabolic scope. However, empirical support for this prediction remains equivocal, and experiments covering a substantial proportion of individual prey ontogeny until maturation are lacking. To fill these gaps, we ran a laboratory experiment to investigate how warming and non-consumptive predation risk influence life history responses in the larvae of the mayflyCloeon dipterum, an aquatic insect with highly plastic development. We reared larvae of varying initial sizes at three temperatures (21, 24, and 27 degrees C) in a risk-free environment and under predation risk signalled by chemical cues from dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea), and followed their individual survival, growth, and development until emergence. SomeC. dipterumlarvae substantially prolonged their development and the proportion of theseslowindividuals declined rapidly with temperature and increased with predation risk. We attribute this response to cohort splitting, a common life history strategy of aquatic insects and other taxa in unpredictable environment. Growth, development, and maturation varied predictably with temperature in thefastlarvae that did not prolong their development. They grew and developed faster but matured at smaller sizes with increasing temperature. Predation risk tended to slow down individual growth and development in line with the reduced metabolic scope hypothesis, but the differences were relatively minor and observable only at 21 degrees C. Survival to subimago increased with predation risk, possibly due to indirect effects mediated by dissolved micronutrients, but did not vary significantly with temperature. Survival also tended to be higher in theslowindividuals. This partly compensated for a smaller final size relative to thefastindividuals and made both strategies comparable in overall fitness. Our results show that warming may erode individual-level variability in life history responses to predation risk. This implies that warming can synchronise population dynamics and consequently make such populations more vulnerable to unpredictable disturbances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000569341800001

By extension, it also affects those ecological interactions that are mediated by gland-produced chemical compounds, such as reservoir-based chemical defense. Herein, we investigate how environmental temperature affects the regeneration of defensive secretions and influences the efficacy of chemical defense in a model predator-prey system: the oribatid miteArchegozetes longisetosusand the predaceous rove beetleStenus juno. Through a combination of chemical analyses, non-linear regression modeling and theoretical simulations we show that the amount of defensive secretion responded to temperature in a unimodal optimum curve: the regeneration rate followed a positive, linear relationship up to 35 degrees C, but rapidly broke down beyond this temperature ("tipping point" effect). Using functional response simulations, there is an initially positive dampening effect on the predation rate when regeneration is optimal, but at higher temperatures chemical defense does not counteract the previously described effects of elevated predatory pressure. In a larger context, our results demonstrate the need to integrate relevant environmental factors in predator-prey modeling approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0098-0331	1573-1561		WOS:000565093500002	32875537

A palaeohistological analysis suggests ectothermy								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				131	1			154	162		10.1093/biolinnean/blaa081				SEP 2020	2020	Most Notosuchia were active terrestrial predators. A few were semi-aquatic, or were insectivorous, omnivorous or herbivorous. A question relative to their thermometabolism remains to be answered: were Notosuchia warm-blooded? Here we use quantitative bone palaeohistology to answer this question. Two variables were used as proxies to infer thermometabolism: resting metabolic rate and red blood cell dimensions. Resting metabolic rate was inferred using relative primary osteon area and osteocyte size, shape and density. Blood cell dimensions were inferred using harmonic mean canal diameter and minimum canal diameter. All inferences were performed using phylogenetic eigenvector maps. Both sets of analyses suggest that the seven species of Notosuchia sampled in this study were ectotherms. Given that extant Neosuchia (their sister group) are also ectotherms, and that archosaurs were primitively endotherms, parsimony suggests that endothermy may have been lost at the node Metasuchia (Notosuchia-Neosuchia) by the Early Jurassic. Semi-aquatic taxa such as Pepesuchus may have had thermoregulatory strategies similar to those of recent crocodylians, whereas the terrestrial taxa (Araripesuchus, Armadillosuchus, Iberosuchus, Mariliasuchus, Stratiotosuchus) may have been thermoregulators similar to active predatory varanids. Thermal inertia may have contributed to maintaining a stable temperature in large notosuchians such as Baurusuchus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000580983800012

However, the effects of an important trait-predator foraging strategy-are largely unknown. We investigated the interactions between predator foraging strategy and temperature on two ectotherm predators: an active predator, the backswimmerNotonecta undulata, and a sit-and-wait predator, the damselflyEnallagma annexum. In a series of predator-prey experiments across a temperature gradient, we measured predator feeding rates on an active prey species, zooplanktonDaphnia pulex, predator growth rates, and mechanisms that influence predator feeding: body speed of predators and prey (here measured as swimming speed), prey encounter rates, capture success, attack rates, and handling time. Overall, warming led to increased feeding rates for both predators through changes to each component of the predator's functional response. We found that prey swimming speed strongly increased with temperature. The active predator's swimming speed also increased with temperature, and together, the increase in predator and prey swimming speed resulted in twofold higher prey encounter rates for the active predator at warmer temperatures. By contrast, prey encounter rates of the sit-and-wait predator increased fourfold with rising temperatures as a result of increased prey swimming speed. Concurrently, increased prey swimming speed was associated with a decline in the active predator's capture success at high temperatures, whereas the sit-and-wait predator's capture success slightly increased with temperature. We provide some of the first evidence that foraging traits mediate the indirect effects of warming on predator performance. Understanding how traits influence species' responses to warming could clarify how climate change will affect entire functional groups of species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000562303400001	32726861

Previous studies have shown temperature-driven shifts in herbivore consumption rates and resource preference, but these effects remain poorly understood for predatory arthropods. Here, we investigate how predator killing rates, prey mass consumption, and macronutrient intake respond to increased temperatures using a laboratory and a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Ectothermic predators, wolf spiders (Pardosa sp.), in the lab experiment, were exposed to increased temperatures and different prey macronutrient content (high lipid/low protein and low lipid/high protein) to assess changes in their killing rates and nutritional demands. Additionally, we investigate prey mass and lipid consumption by spiders under contrasting temperatures, along an elevation gradient. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment between low (420 masl; 26 degrees C) and high (2,100 masl; 15 degrees C) elevations in the Ecuadorian Andes, using wild populations of two common orb-weaver spider species (Leucauge sp. and Cyclosa sp.) present along the elevation gradient. We found that killing rates of wolf spiders increased with warmer temperatures but were not significantly affected by prey macronutrient content, although spiders consumed significantly more lipids from lipid-rich prey. The field reciprocal transplant experiment showed no consistent predator responses to changes in temperature along the elevational gradient. Transplanting Cyclosa sp. spiders to low- or high-elevation sites did not affect their prey mass or lipid consumption rate, whereas Leucauge sp. individuals increased prey mass consumption when transplanted from the high to the low warm elevation. Our findings show that increases in temperature intensify predator killing rates, prey consumption, and lipid intake, but the responses to temperature vary between species, which may be a result of species-specific differences in their hunting behavior and sensitivity to temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000561181800001	33005340

For ectotherms, life history strategies are highly dependent on temperature, among other environmental conditions. With projected increases in global temperatures, understanding the success of organisms under warmer conditions is critical. Due to the difficulty of establishing long-term heating studies on whole lake systems, there is little empirical evidence addressing the potential changes in life history strategies of fish in situ in response to future climate warming predictions. Here, we study early growth rates, size-at-maturation, maximum adult size, and lifespan of bluegill sunfish in three lakes in Illinois from 2013 to 2017 that experience above-ambient temperatures year-round due to artificial heating by electrical power plant cooling systems and compare these to populations in three nearby ambient lakes. Temperature changes in the heated lakes are within the range of temperature increases predicted by the year 2100. We find evidence that life history strategies and population demographics are substantially affected by warmer environments. Heated populations showed 22% faster first-year growth, 23% shorter lifespans, greater rates of maturation at small body sizes, and over a 4-fold reduction in the relative number of individuals that reach large sizes. Changes in life history strategies, including lifespan and maximum sizes, will be evident across many fish species under warmer conditions in the future and further research should aim to address how these changes will affect trophic interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000558613600001

As such, it is an important determinant of the potential invasive ability of organisms and may limit population expansion unless organisms can physiologically respond to changes in temperature either through plasticity or by adapting to their novel environment. Here, we studied the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, which has become invasive on a global scale. We compared adults from an invasive population of western France with individuals from two populations in the native range in South Africa. We measured the thermal dependence of locomotor performance in adults given its relevance to dispersal, predator escape, and prey capture. Our results show significant differences in the limits of the 80% performance breadth interval for endurance with the French population showing a left shift in its limits congruent with the colder climate experienced in France. The French invasive population was introduced only about 40years ago suggesting a rapid shift in the thermal physiology. Given that all individuals were acclimated under laboratory conditions at 23 degrees C for 2 months this suggests that the invasive frogs have adapted to their new environment. These data may allow the refinement of physiologically informed species distribution models permitting better estimates of future ranges at risk of invasion.

While the detrimental effects of summer heat waves have been widely studied, little is known about the impacts of winter warming on marine species in temperate regions. Many species benefit from low winter temperature-induced reductions in metabolism, as these permit conservation of energy reserves that are needed to support reproduction in spring. Here, we used a unique outdoor mesocosm system to expose a coastal predator-prey system, the sea starAsteriasand the blue musselMytilus, to different winter warming scenarios under near-natural conditions. We found that the body condition of mussels decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. Sea star growth also decreased with increasing temperature, which was a function of unaltered predation rates and decreased mussel body condition.Asteriasrelative digestive gland mass strongly declined over the studied temperature interval (catwofold). This could have severe implications for reproductive capacity in the following spring, as digestive glands provide reserve compounds to maturing gonads. Thus, both predator and prey suffered from a mismatch of energy acquisition versus consumption in warmer winter scenarios, with pronounced consequences for food web energy transfer in future oceans.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000553111800006	32673558

As physical performance often affects the outcome of predator-prey interactions, environmental temperature can influence the ability of ectotherms to capture prey and/or defend themselves against predators. However, previous research on the kinematics of ectotherms suggests that some species may use elastic storage mechanisms when attacking or defending, thereby mitigating the effects of sub-optimal temperature. Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) are a speciose group of ectothermic viperid snakes that rely on crypsis, rattling and striking to deter predators. We examined the influence of body temperature on the behavior and kinematics of two rattlesnake species (Crotalus oreganus helleri and Crotalus scutulatus) when defensively striking towards a threatening stimulus. We recorded defensive strikes at body temperatures ranging from 15-35 degrees C. We found that strike speed and speed of mouth gaping during the strike were positively correlated with temperature. We also found a marginal effect of temperature on the probability of striking, latency to strike and strike outcome. Overall, warmer snakes are more likely to strike, strike faster, open their mouth faster and reach maximum gape earlier than colder snakes. However, the effects of temperature were less than would be expected for purely muscle-driven movements. Our results suggest that, although rattlesnakes are at a greater risk of predation at colder body temperatures, their decrease in strike performance may be mitigated to some extent by employing mechanisms in addition to skeletal muscle contraction (e.g. elastic energy storage) to power strikes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000576693500013	32561628

To date, there is no consensus on whether warming increases or decreases consumer needs for dietary carbon (C) relatively to phosphorus (P), thus hindering predictions of secondary production responses to global change. Here, we investigate how the dietary C:P ratio optimising consumer growth (TERC:P: Threshold Elemental Ratio) changes along temperature gradients by combining a temperature-dependent TERC:P model with growth experiments on Daphnia magna. Both lines of evidence show that the TERC:P response to temperature is U-shaped. This shape indicates that consumer nutrient requirements can both increase or decrease with increasing temperature, thus reconciling previous contradictive observations into a common framework. This unified framework improves our capacity to forecast the combined effects of nutrient cycle and climatic alterations on invertebrate production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000525566900009	32212238

Acute changes in environmental temperature are known to impact the rate at which animals change colour, and therefore may affect their survival.Many ectotherms have the ability to acclimate performance traits such as locomotion, metabolic rate and growth rate with changes in seasonal temperature. However, it remains unclear how other functional traits that are directly linked to behaviour and survival respond to long-term changes in temperature (within an individual's lifetime).We assessed whether the rate of colour change is altered by long-term changes in temperature (seasonal variation) and if rate of colour change can acclimate to seasonal thermal conditions. We used an intertidal rock-pool goby Bathygobius cocosensis, to test this and exposed individuals to representative seasonal mean temperatures (16 or 31 degrees C, herein referred to cold- and warm-exposed fish respectively) for 9 weeks and then tested their rate of luminance change when placed on white and black backgrounds at acute test temperatures 16 and 31 degrees C. We modelled rate of luminance change using the visual sensitives of a coral trout Plectropmus leopardus to determine how well gobies matched their backgrounds in terms of luminance contrast to a potential predator.After exposure to long-term seasonal conditions, the warm-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their background more closely when tested at 31 than at 16 degrees C. Similarly, the cold-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their backgrounds more closely at 16 degrees C than at 31 degrees C. This demonstrates that rate of luminance change can be adjusted to compensate for long-term changes in seasonal temperature.This is the first study to show that animals can acclimate rate of colour change for background matching to seasonal thermal conditions. We also show that rapid changes in acute temperature reduce background matching capabilities. Stochastic changes in climate are likely to affect the frequency of predator-prey interactions which may have substantial knock-on effects throughout ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000525986000001	32227334

Ectothermic omnivores increase herbivory in response to rising temperature								OIKOS				129	7			1028	1039		10.1111/oik.07082		MAR 2020		JUL 2020	2020	Higher temperatures as a consequence of global climate change may considerably alter trophic interactions. Ectothermic herbivores and carnivores generally ingest more food with rising temperature as their metabolic rates increase with rising temperature. However, omnivorous ectotherms may respond in two ways: quantitatively by consuming more food and qualitatively by altering their degree of herbivory or carnivory through a diet shift. We hypothesize that rising temperature will increase herbivory of ectothermic omnivores as herbivory increases towards the equator. We tested the hypothesis in a freshwater model system in which ectothermic omnivores are prevalent, by applying two approaches, a temperature manipulation experiment and a literature study. We performed feeding trials with a juvenile aquatic ectothermic omnivore (pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) at different temperatures ranging from 12 to 27 degrees C, supplying them with both animal food and plant material, and directly quantified their consumption rates over time. The results showed that snails cultured at high temperatures (> 21 degrees C) increased the proportion of plant material in their diets after 17 days, which supports our hypothesis. In the literature survey, we found that rising temperature increased herbivory in multiple aquatic animal taxa, including zooplankton, amphibians, crayfish, fish and snails. This suggests that aquatic ectothermic omnivores might commonly increase herbivory with rising temperature. The mechanisms underlying this temperature-induced diet shift are not sufficiently explained by current theories related to the physiology, metabolism and stoichiometry of omnivores. We propose to incorporate the animals' ontogenetic development in the temperature metabolic stoichiometry hypothesis as a complementary explanation for the diet shift, namely that the diet shift could be due to faster development of the ectotherms and an earlier ontogenetic diet shift at higher temperatures. We conclude that future global warming will most likely alter food webs by increasing the top-down control of aquatic herbivores and omnivores on primary producers.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000522509500001

Likely modulated by the intensity, frequency and duration of these events, dietary shifts during heat waves may threaten the stability of freshwaters. We investigated the effects of heat wave duration on diet assimilation and life-history traits of the freshwater gastropod Radix balthica. We compared the magnitude of the effects of a short (1 week) and a long heat wave (7 weeks) on the assimilation of animal- and plant-based diets, measuring performance in terms of growth rate and reproduction. We hypothesized that heat waves should increase the proportion of plant material assimilated on the mixed diet and change the performance of snails on the animal and plant-based diets. Both heat waves increased the assimilation of plant material on the mixed diet and growth rate, with minor negative effects on reproduction. However, responses were disproportional to heat wave duration, as the short heat wave elicited swift and relatively stronger responses. Our findings showcase the role of phenotypic plasticity in aiding ectotherms to cope with increased thermal stress and acclimate. Temporarily changing the strength of trophic interactions, heat waves may alter community dynamics in freshwater habitats.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000512772400002

When exposed to colder temperatures, ectotherms develop more slowly, but mature at larger body sizes and vice versa at higher temperatures. We investigated whether a phytoseiid predatory mite can obtain a larger body size by rearing it at a low temperature and how the increased body size affected predatory performance on its natural prey. Therefore, we allowed the predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to develop at either 15 or 25 degrees C. RESULTS A. limonicus reared at 15 degrees C had a 6% larger body size than those reared at 25 degrees C. Larger predators showed higher predation rates on first instars of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), with 9.6 instars/female/day and 8.5 instars/female/day, for larger and standard-sized females, respectively. After three generations reared at 15 degrees C, body size did not increase any further. When reared for five generations at 15 degrees C, larger A. limonicus females demonstrated a better ability to subdue second-instar F. occidentalis.

Species interactions relay the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on individuals to communities, and detailed understanding across these levels is crucial to predict ecological consequences of climate change. We provide a conceptual framework that links temperature effects on insect physiology and behaviour to altered species interactions and community dynamics. We highlight key features of this framework with recent studies investigating the impacts of warming climate on insects and other ectotherms and identify methodological, taxonomic and geographic biases. While the effects of increased constant temperatures are now well understood, future studies should focus on temperature variation, interactions with other stressors and cross-system comparisons.									12	0	0	0	8	0	12			2214-5745	2214-5753		WOS:000490898000014	31445412

The mechanisms behind this pattern, however, remain unaddressed. Using visual sampling of potential predators and live flies as baits, we assessed predation patterns along 4,000-m elevation transects on either side of the equatorial Andes. At the lower elevations, we found that around 80% of predation events on our insect baits were due to ants. The decline in predation with elevation was driven mainly by a decline in the abundance of ants, whose importance relative to other predators also declined. We show that both predator density and activity (predation rate per individual predator) decreased with elevation, thus ascribing specific mechanisms to known predation patterns. We suggest that changes in these two mechanisms may reflect changes in primary productivity and metabolic rate with temperature, factors of potential relevance across latitudinal and other macroecological gradients, particularly for ectotherm predators and prey.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000482091000006	31553213	
J	Warren, Donald T.; McCormick, Mark, I								Intrageneric differences in the effects of acute temperature exposure on competitive behaviour of damselfishes								PEERJ				7						e7320	10.7717/peerj.7320				JUL 17 2019	2019	Projected increases in global temperatures brought on by climate change threaten to disrupt many biological and ecological processes. Tropical ectotherms, like many fishes, can be particularly susceptible to temperature change as they occupy environments with narrow thermal fluctuations. While climate change models predict temperatures to increase over decades, thermal fluctuations are already experienced on a seasonal scale, which may affect the ability to capture and defend resources across a thermal gradient. For coral reef fish, losers of competitive interactions are often more vulnerable to predation, and this pressure is strongest just after settlement. Competitive interactions may determine future success for coral reef fishes, and understanding how temperature experienced during settlement can influence such interactions will give insight to community dynamics in a future warmer world. We tested the effect of increased temperatures on intraspecific competitive interactions of two sympatric species of reef damselfish, the blue damselfish Pomacentrus nagasakiensis, and the whitetail damselfish Pomacentrus chrysurus. Juvenile fishes were exposed to one of four temperature treatments, ranging from 26-32 degrees C, for seven days then placed into competitive arenas where aggressive interactions were recorded between sized matched individuals within each species. While there was no apparent effect of temperature treatment on aggressive behaviour for P. chrysurus, we observed up to a four-fold increase in aggression scores for P. nagasakiensis with increasing temperature. Results suggest that temperature experienced as juveniles can impact aggressive behaviour; however, species-specific thermal tolerances led to behavioural affects that differ among closely related species. Differential thermal tolerance among species may cause restructuring of the interaction network that underlies the structure of reef assemblages.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000475841800003	31346499	
J	Huryn, Alexander D.; Benstead, Jonathan P.								Seasonal changes in light availability modify the temperature dependence of secondary production in an Arctic stream								ECOLOGY				100	6					e02690	10.1002/ecy.2690				JUN 2019	2019	Light and temperature are key drivers of ecosystem productivity, but synchrony of their annual cycles typically obscures their relative influence. The coupling of annual light-temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69 degrees N, annual water temperature range 4-7 degrees C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light-temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000474127300001	30854634

Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0921-2973	1572-9761		WOS:000475643000013

Selective agents, such as introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits, suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection. These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to selection by temperature.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000466555000008

We documented the thermal limits of larvae of three amphibian species native to Hong Kong, and their introduced, invasive predator, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0-21.6 degrees C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions. This could mean a reduction in their capacity to deal with other stressors such as pollution and predators, and that G. affinis may have an advantage over native amphibians.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000466820900020	30975413

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000466375600012

Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations < 2 mg L-1. However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.									16	0	0	0	10	0	16				2296-7745		WOS:000462731700001

Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20 degrees C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P. fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F. candida, but killed F. candida when P. fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000458963200007	30303532

Feeding is an ecologically relevant task which is controlled by muscle function. Consequently, in ectotherms, muscle function and feeding kinematics can be altered by temperature. This study investigated the effect of decreasing temperature on the feeding kinematics of the northern most labrid in the Western Atlantic. During winter, cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) enter a state of extended torpor in order to conserve energy when water temperatures drop below similar to 10 degrees C. We hypothesized that feeding kinematics would be slower at lower temperatures especially those associated with torpor (<= 10 degrees C). Additionally, we hypothesized that prey type will elicit different feeding behaviors. Feeding events on sandworms and Asian shore crabs were recorded at 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. Fish held at 5 degrees C had slower opening and closing jaw velocities while using more ram than the other temperature treatments. No differences were detected between prey types. For both prey types, the temperature treatment which consistently induced torpor (5 degrees C) slowed oral jaw movements, which likely forced cunner to rely more on ram than suction to capture prey. Torpor temperatures appeared to have less of an effect on feeding than on metabolic rate, steady swimming capabilities and muscle function, suggesting some compensatory mechanisms of feeding musculature in cunner.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000458431500005

Amphibious fishes have a variety of strategies, both physiological and/or behavioural, to cope with a broad range of thermal conditions. This study examined the relationship between prolonged (5 weeks) exposure to a range of temperatures (22, 25, 28, or 32 degrees C) on oxygen uptake rate and movement behaviours (i.e., thermoregulation and emergence) in a common amphibious fish, the barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilneatuis). At the highest temperature examined (32 degrees C, approximately 5 degrees C above their summer average temperatures), barred mudskippers exhibited 33.7-97.7% greater oxygen uptake rates at rest ((M) over dotO(2Rest)), emerged at a higher temperature (CTe; i.e., a modified critical thermal maxima (CTMax) methodology) of 41.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C relative to those maintained at 28, 25, or 22 degrees C. The 32 degrees C-maintained fish also ceased movement activity at the highest holding temperature suggesting that prolonged submergence at elevated temperatures is physiologically and energetically stressful to the individual. Using exhaustive exercise protocols with and without air exposure to simulate a predatory chase, the time to recovery was examined for all individuals. When submerged, mudskippers required 2.5x longer recovery time to return to resting oxygen uptake from exhaustive exercise than those fully emerged in air. Oxygen uptake data revealed that air exposure did not accrue oxygen debt, thereby allowing faster return to resting oxygen consumption rates. If the option to emerge was not available, mudskippers preferentially sought more benign water temperatures (26.7 +/- 2.1 degrees C), resembling those experienced by these fish during the Austral autumn, regardless of prolonged exposure higher or lower temperatures. These results add to our understanding of the strategies that amphibious fishes may use to mitigate extra costs associated with living in warm waters, and could be the key to understanding how such species will cope with increasing temperatures in the future.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0306-4565			WOS:000454467700009	30509669

To better understand how modest climate differences affect lizard energetics, we compared daily feeding and metabolism rates of individual Sceloporus occidentalis in two populations during mid-summer. Chuckanut Beach (CB) was a cool, maritime climate in northern Washington State, and Sondino Ranch (SR) was a warmer, drier climate in southern, inland Washington. We found no difference between populations in daily energy expenditure (DEE), as calculated from doubly labeled water estimates. The CB population, however, had significantly higher prey availability and rate of daily energy intake (DEI) as estimated from fecal pellet masses. Consequently, CB lizards had higher size adjusted body masses than lizards from SR. Within CB, during midsummer, DEE was similar to DEI. Within the SR population, DEE trended higher than DEI during midsummer, but was not significantly different. We found no population differences in lizard activity, active body temperature, or preferred body temperature. Hence, we infer the longer activity season for the SR population may compensate for the low food availability and high daily energy cost of midsummer. Moreover, for the CB population, we infer that cooler temperatures and higher food availability allow the lizards to compensate for the shorter activity. We also suggest the CB population may benefit from the predicted warmer temperatures associated with climate change given the similar activity-period body temperatures and DEE between these lizard populations assuming food availability is sufficient.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0045-8511	1938-5110		WOS:000446747700008

However, the Qinghai toad-headed lizards (Phrynocephalus vlangalii) grow faster and reach a larger adult size at a high-elevation site than at a low-elevation site. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic and environmental causes of this between-population difference in growth rate by conducting mark-recapture and common garden experiments on juvenile growth rate, and investigating the thermal environment, lizard body temperature, potential prey availability at the two elevation sites.Results: Compared with low-elevation individuals, high-elevation juvenile lizards had higher growth rates in the field, but grew at similar rates in the laboratory. High-elevation lizards had higher active body temperatures than low-elevation lizards despite similar air temperatures in the period of field investigation. The high-elevation site had relatively more and larger preys than the low-elevation site.Conclusions: Inter-population difference in growth rate of P. vlangalii may primarily result from developmental plasticity in response to the difference in environmental resources, rather than genetic differentiation. The higher growth rate of high-elevation lizards is likely associated with higher potential food availability and higher active body temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2				1472-6785		WOS:000445796100001	30249235

In a climate change context, increased warming and dryness will likely affect arthropod communities of agro-ecosystems managed by biological pest control. In this work, we compare, at the individual level, the functional relation between temperature and relative humidity and different life-history parameters in two sister predatory mite species that inhabit Spanish avocado crops, Euseius stipulatus and E. scutalis (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). We found that negative effects of high temperature and low relative humidity were stronger in E. stipulatus than in E. scutalis.

In ectotherms, anthropogenic warming often increases energy requirements for metabolism, which can either impair growth (when resources are limiting) or lead to higher predator feeding rates and possibly stronger top-down trophic interactions. However, the relative importance of these effects in nature remains unclear because: (1) thermal adaptation or acclimation could lower metabolic costs; (2) greater prey production at warmer temperatures could compensate for higher predator feeding rates; and/or (3) temperature effects on trophic interactions via altered biological rates could be small relative to other, temperature-unrelated human impacts on food webs.2. Here, we examined effects of deforestation-associated warming on the minnow Enteromius neumayeri, occurring in both forested (cool) and deforested (warm) streams located inside or nearby an afrotropical rainforest. Combining approaches from physiological and community ecology, we quantified impacts of anthropogenic warming on the metabolism, growth and trophic interactions of this tropical ectotherm. We then compared these effects with impacts of land use unrelated to temperature.3. In a long-term laboratory acclimation experiment quantifying the temperature dependence of growth and metabolism in E. neumayeri, warming increased metabolic rates and decreased growth (at a limited ration). We found no evidence of local (thermal) adaptation, with warming affecting farm and forest populations similarly.4. Then, using mark-recapture methods to quantify impacts of warming on performance in situ, we found similar growth rates in fish from deforested and forested streams despite their distinct thermal environments. This suggests higher prey consumption at deforested sites to compensate for greater metabolic costs, which could strengthen fish-invertebrate interactions.5. Finally, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate fish-invertebrate interaction strength and quantify temperature-related and unrelated impacts of land use on this interaction. We found that although warming increased fish consumption, it apparently increased invertebrate production even more and thus had a net-weakening effect on estimated interaction strength. Most importantly, variation in both fish and invertebrate density not directly related to temperature had a much stronger influence on estimated interaction strength than temperature effects on predator consumption and prey growth.6. We conclude that ectotherms can sometimes offset the metabolic costs of warming with a small increase in consumption that hardly effects food web interactions compared to non-metabolic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances. Future research should assess whether this is a common feature of heavily impacted ecosystems facing multiple stressors.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000431991700019

An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25A degrees C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000426783400011		
J	Cloyed, Carl S.; Eason, Perri K.; Dell, Anthony, I								The thermal dependence of carbon stable isotope incorporation and trophic discrimination in the domestic cricket, Acheta domesticus								JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY				107				34	40		10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.02.003				MAY-JUN 2018	2018	Stable isotopes are valuable tools in physiological and ecological research, as they can be used to estimate diet, habitat use, and resource allocation. However, in most cases a priori knowledge of two key properties of stable isotopes is required, namely their rate of incorporation into the body (incorporation rate) and the change of isotope values between consumers and resources that arises during incorporation of the isotopes into the consumer's tissues (trophic discrimination). Previous studies have quantified these properties across species and tissue types, but little is known about how they vary with temperature, a key driver of many biological rates and times. Here, we explored for the first time how temperature affects both carbon incorporation rate and trophic discrimination via growth rates, using the domestic cricket, Acheta domesticus. We raised crickets at 16 degrees C, 21 degrees C, and 26 degrees C and showed that temperature increased carbon isotope incorporation rate, which was driven by both an increased growth rate and catabolism at higher temperatures. Trophic discrimination of carbon isotopes decreased at higher temperatures, which we attributed to either lower activation energies needed to synthesize non-essential amino acids at higher temperatures or the increased utilization of available resources of consumers at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate that temperature is a key driver of both carbon isotope incorporation rate and trophic discrimination, via mechanisms that likely persist across all ectotherms. Experiments to determine incorporation rates and trophic discrimination factors in ectotherms must include temperature as a major factor, and natural variation in temperature might have significant effects on these isotopic properties that then can affect inferences made from isotope values.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-1910	1879-1611		WOS:000434751100006	29432766

Because the metabolism and consumption rates of ectotherms increase sharply with temperature, there are major concerns that global warming will increase the strength of trophic interactions, destabilizing food webs, and altering ecosystem structure and function. We used geothermally warmed streams that span an 11 degrees C temperature gradient to investigate the interplay between temperature-driven selection on traits related to metabolism and resource acquisition, and the interaction strength between the keystone gastropod grazer, Radix balthica, and a common algal resource. Populations from a warm stream (similar to 28 degrees C) had higher maximal metabolic rates and optimal temperatures than their counterparts from a cold stream (similar to 17 degrees C). We found that metabolic rates of the population originating from the warmer stream were higher across all measurement temperatures. A reciprocal transplant experiment demonstrated that the interaction strengths between the grazer and its algal resource were highest for both populations when transplanted into the warm stream. In line with the thermal dependence of respiration, interaction strengths involving grazers from the warm stream were always higher than those with grazers from the cold stream. These results imply that increases in metabolism and resource consumption mediated by the direct, thermodynamic effects of higher temperatures on physiological rates are not mitigated by metabolic compensation in the long term, and suggest that warming could increase the strength of algal-grazer interactions with likely knock-on effects for the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic ecosystems.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000426504400029	29281766

A mechanistic framework could better predict these different temperature-disease outcomes. However, such a framework remains challenging to develop, due to the nonlinear and (sometimes) opposing thermal responses of different host and parasite traits and due to the difficulty of validating model predictions with observations and experiments. We address these challenges in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) system. We test the hypothesis that warmer temperatures promote disease spread and produce larger epidemics. In lakes, epidemics that start earlier and warmer in autumn grow much larger. In a mesocosm experiment, warmer temperatures produced larger epidemics. A mechanistic model parameterized with trait assays revealed that this pattern arose primarily from the temperature dependence of transmission rate (), governed by the increasing foraging (and, hence, parasite exposure) rate of hosts (f). In the trait assays, parasite production seemed sufficiently responsive to shape epidemics as well; however, this trait proved too thermally insensitive in the mesocosm experiment and lake survey to matter much. Thus, in warmer environments, increased foraging of hosts raised transmission rate, yielding bigger epidemics through a potentially general, exposure-based mechanism for ectotherms. This mechanistic approach highlights how a trait-based framework will enhance predictive insight into responses of infectious disease to a warmer world.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000428287200004	29570399

Because ectotherm locomotor performance depends on temperature, rattlesnakes could use prey temperature to evaluate the potential of lizards to evade attacks. Here, we tested whether hunting rattlesnakes use infrared information to (1) detect and (2) evaluate prey before attack. We expected thermal contrast between prey and background to be the best predictor of predatory behaviour under the prey detection hypothesis, and absolute prey temperature under the prey evaluation hypothesis. We presented lizard carcasses of varying temperatures to free-ranging sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) and scored behavioural responses as a function of thermal contrast, absolute lizard temperature, and light level. Thermal contrast and light level were the most salient predictors of snake behaviour. Snakes were more likely to respond to lizards and/or respond at greater distances at night and when thermal contrast was high, supporting the known prey detection function of infrared sensing. Absolute lizard temperature was not an important predictor of snake behaviour; thus, we found no evidence for temperature-based prey evaluation. Infrared sensing is still poorly understood in ecologically relevant contexts; future research will test whether rattlesnakes learn to evaluate prey based on temperature with experience.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0340-7594	1432-1351		WOS:000425333200004	29218413

We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter-spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%-285% across time, while two larger spring-summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1-1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2-4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (T-max) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with T-max were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes.									13	1	0	0	13	1	13			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000414969000044	28712135

Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, 'fright' bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28 degrees C, and 'high' climate warming, 34 degrees C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34 degrees C (Q(10)=7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9 +/- 27.8% and 27.8 +/- 16.5% (means +/- s.e.m.) at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive. Together these findings suggest decrements in fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures stem from increased oxygen demand coupled with a reduced capacity for metabolic depression.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000412240500025	28978640

We assessed how changes in mean and standard deviation of sea surface temperature (SST), frequency and magnitude of warm SST extreme climatic events (ECE) influenced the stochastic population growth rate log(lambda(s)) and age structure of a black-browed albatross population. For changes in SST around historical levels observed since 1982, changes in standard deviation had a larger (threefold) and negative impact on log(lambda s) compared to changes in mean. By contrast, the mean had a positive impact on log(lambda s). The historical SST mean was lower than the optimal SST value for which log(lambda s) was maximized. Thus, a larger environmental mean increased the occurrence of SST close to this optimum that buffered the negative effect of ECE. This 'climate safety margin' (i.e. difference between optimal and historical climatic conditions) and the specific shape of the population growth rate response to climate for a species determine how ECE affect the population. For a wider range in SST, both the mean and standard deviation had negative impact on log(lambda s), with changes in the mean having a greater effect than the standard deviation. Furthermore, around SST historical levels increases in either mean or standard deviation of the SST distribution led to a younger population, with potentially important conservation implications for black-browed albatrosses.This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000400921300009	28483873

However, few studies have compared the performance of invasive predators and native prey, despite the fact that non-native predators are well known to disrupt native communities. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis' suggests that predators are less tolerant of increasing environmental stress than their prey, whereas the tolerant invaders hypothesis' suggests that invaders are more tolerant than native species due to selection during the introduction process. It is therefore unclear how invasive predators will respond to increasing climate stressors. We coupled physiological measurements (thermal tolerance, thermal optima, salinity tolerance, predation rate) with environmental time-series data to assess the effects of warming and extreme low salinity events on non-native predators (gastropods) and native prey (oysters) from a coastal ecosystem. In general support of the trophic sensitivity hypothesis, we found that both non-native predators exhibited lower thermal optima relative to native prey, lower salinity tolerance and one predator was less tolerant of warming. However, because warming tolerance was extremely high (i.e. habitat temperature is 79-21 degrees C below thermal tolerance), near-term warming may first increase predator performance (consumption and growth rates), with negative effects on prey. Low salinity will likely produce heterogeneous effects on predator-prey interactions due to varying watershed sizes among estuaries that control the duration of low salinity events. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis may be a useful framework for understanding community responses to extreme climate change, which portends a decoupling of predator-prey interactions. However, we conclude that this hypothesis must be evaluated in environmental context and that coupling physiological metrics with insitu environmental data offers the best predictive power of near-term climate change impacts on invaded communities. Within our study system, warming is likely to intensify the impacts of both invasive predators, which may greatly reduce the abundance of the native oyster, a species of conservation and restoration focus.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000395347300010		
J	Schmitz, Oswald J.; Rosenblatt, Adam E.; Smylie, Meredith								Temperature dependence of predation stress and the nutritional ecology of a generalist herbivore								ECOLOGY				97	11			3119	3130		10.1002/ecy.1524				NOV 2016	2016	Prey at risk of predation may experience stress and respond physiologically by altering their metabolic rates. Theory predicts that such physiological changes should alter prey nutrient demands from N-rich to C-rich macronutrients and shift the balance between maintenance and growth/reproduction. Theory further suggests that for ectotherms, temperature stands to exacerbate this stress. Yet, the interactive effects of predation stress and temperature stress on diet, metabolism, and survival of ectotherms are not well known. This knowledge gap was addressed with a laboratory study in which wild juvenile grasshoppers were collected, assigned to one of three groups, and raised at three different temperatures. All grasshoppers had access to equal quantities of two diets composed of opposite carbohydrate:protein ratios. Half of the individuals in each temperature group were exposed to predation risk cues from spider predators, while the other half were kept in risk free conditions. Grasshoppers consumed more carbohydrates when exposed to predation risk, but consumption favored greater protein intake as temperature increased. Moreover, the difference in carbohydrate intake between risk cue and risk free treatments diminished as temperature increased. Furthermore, variability between individual consumption patterns both within and between treatments decreased markedly as temperature increased, suggesting that higher temperatures promote more consistent individual consumption behaviors. Grasshoppers grew faster and larger as temperature increased, which translated into higher survival rates at higher temperatures. Warmer grasshoppers also did not alter their metabolic rates in response to predation risk cues, in contrast to colder grasshoppers. Digestive efficiency increased with temperature as well -- further indicating that lower temperatures were much more stressful than higher temperatures for grasshoppers. The study shows that physiological responses of ectothermic herbivores to predation stress are highly plastic and temperature dependent, with higher temperatures promoting increased protein intake, growth, development, survival, and digestive efficiency relative to colder temperatures. These findings help to reconcile why dietary responses (proportion of protein vs. carbohydrate intake) to predation stress may vary among different prey taxa studied previously.									30	0	0	0	28	0	30			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000387228200022	27870021

Because many of the underlying mechanisms of foraging are temperature dependent in ectotherms, the distribution of ectothermic foragers between food patches may similarly depend on temperature because the difference in fitness rewards between these patches may change with temperature. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of Common Gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) between food patches can be explained by an IFD, but that conformance to an IFD weakens as temperature departs from the optimal temperature because fitness rewards, interference competition and the number of individuals foraging are highest at the optimal temperature. First, we determined the optimal temperature for foraging. Second, we examined group foraging at three temperatures and three density treatments. Search time was optimized at 27 degrees C, handling time at 29 degrees C and digestion time at 32 degrees C. Gartersnakes did not match an IFD at any temperature, but their distribution did change with temperature: snakes at 20 degrees C and at 30 degrees C selected both food patches equally, while snakes at 25 degrees C selected the low food patch more at low density and the high food patch more at high density. Food consumption and competition increased with temperature, and handling time decreased with temperature. Temperature therefore had a strong impact on foraging, but did not affect the IFD. Future work should examine temperature-dependent foraging in ectotherms that are known to match an IFD.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			0179-1613	1439-0310		WOS:000385572700007

Due to the effects of temperature on both the physiology and the behaviour of such ectotherms, understanding how global warming may influence their ecological impact is a research priority. These species were therefore exposed to three different food types to determine their detritivorous, herbivorous and carnivorous characters, and predation was measured characterizing the Holling's functional response. The effect of increasing water temperatures (15, 20, 25A degrees C) on both the food choice and predatory activities was investigated. Both species showed a significant preference for animal tissues at all temperatures. The total food intake increased with temperature for G. tigrinus but did not change for D. villosus, which may result from specific species differences in metabolic requirements. The consumption of live prey strongly increased with temperature. The main differences were an increased searching efficiency in G. tigrinus and a decreased handling time in D. villosus as temperature increased, which may result from differences in foraging strategies. These results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the predation pressure of both invasive gammarids on prey species.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000385154400004

In laboratory conditions, we investigated the influence of two commonly used insecticides, spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin, on mortality and functional response of a community of Philodromus spiders (P. cespitum 80 %, P. albidus 20 %) at different temperatures (10, 17, 25, and 31 A degrees C). Almost all spiders died at 31 A degrees C in the lambda-cyhalothrin treatment. Mortality was very low at other temperatures. Mortality in the spinosad treatment did not differ from the control. Both pesticides reduced the prey capture rate and/or changed the type of functional response at all temperatures. The sublethal effects of lambda-cyhalothrin were most pronounced at 10 A degrees C, while those of spinosad were most marked at 10 and 25 A degrees C. At 10 A degrees C, the pesticides' effects on the spiders were long lasting. In addition, lambda-cyhalothrin influenced the philodromids much more negatively than spinosad suggesting its incompatibility with IPM across all temperatures. The results support the importance of studying the temperature-specific effects of pesticides in order to increase the efficiency of integrated pest management. Philodromids are effective in pest suppression at low temperatures, but application of pesticides at the beginning of the season can significantly disrupt their biocontrol potential.									20	1	0	0	18	0	20			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000376923400020

Thermal and moisture habitat preferences do not maximize jumping performance in frogs								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				30	5			733	742		10.1111/1365-2435.12535				MAY 2016	2016	1. Amphibians are suffering population declines globally, and understanding how environmental parameters influence their thermal and moisture preferences and performance at various tasks is crucial to understanding how these animals will be influenced by climate change.2. Body temperature and hydration affect organismal performance at many fitness-related tasks. Since amphibians are ectotherms with highly water-permeable skin, environmental temperature and moisture directly affect their body temperature and hydration. Therefore, amphibians should select habitats with the optimal combination of temperature and moisture to perform tasks necessary for survival. However, interactions between environmental temperature and moisture can influence habitat selection and task performance in different and often unpredictable ways, and this has only infrequently been considered.3. We tested for interactions between environmental temperature, moisture and organismal hydration on temperature and moisture preferences and jumping performance in green frogs (Lithobates clamitans) in the laboratory, using thermal and moisture gradients, and high-speed video and force plate data. We then integrated the laboratory experiments with field data.4. In the thermal and moisture gradients, frogs selected environmental conditions that minimized cutaneous evaporative water loss, hydroregulating more stringently than thermoregulating. These results are consistent with frogs in the field, which had highly variable body temperatures, but were always hydrated above 95% of their standard mass. However, conditions that minimized evaporative water loss frequently did not maximize jumping performance because warmer temperatures conferred greater performance.5. The ecology of L. clamitans may explain the discrepancy between their preferences and jumping performance optima because the frogs remain in wet environments that serve as refuges from dehydration. In parts of their range where frogs are subjected to warmer and drier conditions, they are likely to select microhabitats that minimize the risk of dehydration, possibly at the expense of their ability to forage and escape from predators.									19	0	0	0	19	0	19			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000375941800007

Not only average daily temperature, but also diurnal temperature variations may affect prey consumption and life history traits of ectotherms. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations on body size, predation capacity and oviposition rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) when presented with eggs of their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). For both predators, mean daily temperature as well as temperature alternation had a substantial impact on the number of prey consumed. At lower average temperatures, more eggs were killed under an alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C and 25 A degrees C/10 A degrees C) than at the corresponding mean constant temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C). At higher average temperatures (> 25 A degrees C), however, the opposite was observed with higher numbers of prey killed at constant temperatures than at alternating temperatures. At 25 A degrees C, temperature variation had no effect on the predation capacity. A similar trend as for the predation rates was observed for the oviposition rates of the phytoseiids. Body size of N. californicus was affected both by average daily temperature and temperature variation, with smaller adult females emerging at alternating temperatures than at constant temperatures, whereas for P. persimilis, temperature variation had no impact on its body size. Our results demonstrate that temperature variations are likely to affect biological control of T. urticae by the studied phytoseiid predators.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000360999800002

Demographic effects of warming, however, are determined by the expression of these physiological effects through predator-prey and other species interactions. Using field observations and controlled experiments, we measured how increasing temperatures in the Arctic affected development rates and mortality rates (from predation) of immature Arctic mosquitoes in western Greenland. We then developed and parametrized a demographic model to evaluate how temperature affects survival of mosquitoes from the immature to the adult stage. Our studies showed that warming increased development rate of immature mosquitoes (Q(10) = 2.8) but also increased daily mortality from increased predation rates by a dytiscid beetle (Q(10) = 1.2-1.5). Despite increased daily mortality, the model indicated that faster development and fewer days exposed to predators resulted in an increased probability of mosquito survival to the adult stage. Warming also advanced mosquito phenology, bringing mosquitoes into phenological synchrony with caribou. Increases in biting pests will have negative consequences for caribou and their role as a subsistence resource for local communities. Generalizable frameworks that account for multiple effects of temperature are needed to understand how climate change impacts coupled human-natural systems.									27	0	0	0	23	0	27			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000363357100006	26378217

FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISPLAY OF MULTIPLE DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS IN EASTERN INDIGO SNAKES (DRYMARCHON COUPERI)								HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY				10	2			559	571						AUG 2015	2015	The ability to display multiple defensive behaviors may increase the chances of an individual avoiding predation. Morphological and physiological condition often influences the display of particular behaviors. Understanding the factors influencing the display of particular behaviors from a suite of potential behaviors can help understand the conditions under which displaying certain suites of defensive behaviors will confer the greatest advantage. Drymarchon couperi (Eastern Indigo Snake) is a large, non-venomous snake that exhibits multiple visual, auditory, olfactory, and physical defensive behaviors. We studied the responses of wild D. couperi to human capture and examined how the number and presence of individual behaviors were related to extrinsic and intrinsic variables using encounters from 84 snakes. Snakes were more likely to flee from the observer at warmer body temperatures and, once captured, exhibited wide variation in defensive behaviors with less costly (i.e., less aggressive) behaviors predominating. Individuals were more likely to display any type of defensive behavior earlier in the field season (i.e., November through January). However, our variables had relatively little influence on the presence of particular defensive behaviors although, for some behaviors, the probability of displaying a behavior increased as the number of other behaviors exhibited increased. Our study shows that D. couperi defensive behavior is quite variable and that the factors contributing variation are unclear. Environmental factors (e.g., distance to retreat site) or individual predispositions may contribute to some of this variation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2151-0733	1931-7603		WOS:000365085900001

The aim of this study was to examine the independent and interactive effects of long-term stochastic food availability and water temperature on larval survivorship, growth and development of the striped marsh frog, Limnodynastes peronii. Larval L. peronii were reared in conditions of either constant or stochastic food availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26 degrees C), and effects on survival, growth and development were quantified. Over the experimental period, larval growth rate was highest and survivorship lowest at the warmest temperature. However, changes in food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with slower larval growth and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability treatments. Tadpoles in the stochastic food availability treatments did not reach metamorphosis during the experimental period, suggesting that developmental stasis may have been induced by food restriction. Overall, these results demonstrate that changes in food availability alter the effects of water temperature on survival, growth and development. From an applied perspective, understanding how environmental factors interact to cause phenotypic change may assist with amphibian conservation by improving the number of tadpoles generated in captive breeding programmes.									12	1	0	0	12	0	13			2051-1434			WOS:000375198200001	27293714

The locomotor performance of ectotherms is known to be strongly affected by temperature. However, how differences in water temperature may drive the evolution of alternative foraging tactics in amphibious animals remains poorly understood. Fish-eating Viperine snakes Natrix maura occur from high altitude cold water streams to warm shallow lakes, and employ two main feeding strategies: sentinel foraging (underwater sit-and-wait behaviour) and active foraging (fish chasing). Using 272 juvenile snakes we measured: the performance kinetics of diving and swimming in a wide range of water temperatures; basal metabolic levels in relation to body temperature; and the type of foraging mode expressed in water-temperature-acclimated snakes. Individual swimming performances increased with testing temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 degrees C). Apnoea time followed an opposite trend however, plausibly reflecting the fact that oxygen demands are related to the metabolic rate of ectotherms. That is, snake heart rates increased with body temperature. Snakes acclimated to 10 degrees C water mostly displayed sentinel foraging. By contrast, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C water-acclimated snakes were extremely active fish chasers. Individual apnoea times at the various testing temperatures were all correlated; as were individual swimming speeds. There was however no clear relationship between an individual's ability to hold its breath and its ability to swim, suggesting that both performance traits may be the target of different selective pressures. Fast swimming speed and long breath holding abilities are likely key determinants of both foraging success and predatory evasion, although in a context dependent manner. Active swimming foraging is likely to be advantageous in warm water (>20 degrees C), while sentinel foraging appears better suited to cold water (<14 degrees C). The physiological aspects of foraging tactics of amphibious snakes combined with field and laboratory observations support the idea that physiological and environmental constraints may generate shifts in habitat use and associated foraging tactics in amphibious ectotherms.

J	Amarasekare, Priyanga								Effects of temperature on consumer-resource interactions								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				84	3			665	679		10.1111/1365-2656.12320				MAY 2015	2015	Understanding how temperature variation influences the negative (e.g. self-limitation) and positive (e.g. saturating functional responses) feedback processes that characterize consumer-resource interactions is an important research priority. Previous work on this topic has yielded conflicting outcomes with some studies predicting that warming should increase consumer-resource oscillations and others predicting that warming should decrease consumer-resource oscillations. Here, I develop a consumer-resource model that both synthesizes previous findings in a common framework and yields novel insights about temperature effects on consumer-resource dynamics. I report three key findings. First, when the resource species' birth rate exhibits a unimodal temperature response, as demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies, the temperature range over which the consumer-resource interaction can persist is determined by the lower and upper temperature limits to the resource species' reproduction. This contrasts with the predictions of previous studies, which assume that the birth rate exhibits a monotonic temperature response, that consumer extinction is determined by temperature effects on consumer species' traits, rather than the resource species' traits. Secondly, the comparative analysis I have conducted shows that whether warming leads to an increase or decrease in consumer-resource oscillations depends on the manner in which temperature affects intraspecific competition. When the strength of self-limitation increases monotonically with temperature, warming causes a decrease in consumer-resource oscillations. However, if self-limitation is strongest at temperatures physiologically optimal for reproduction, a scenario previously unanalysed by theory but amply substantiated by empirical data, warming can cause an increase in consumer-resource oscillations. Thirdly, the model yields testable comparative predictions about consumer-resource dynamics under alternative hypotheses for how temperature affects competitive and resource acquisition traits. Importantly, it does so through empirically quantifiable metrics for predicting temperature effects on consumer viability and consumer-resource oscillations, which obviates the need for parameterizing complex dynamical models. Tests of these metrics with empirical data on a host-parasitoid interaction yield realistic estimates of temperature limits for consumer persistence and the propensity for consumer-resource oscillations, highlighting their utility in predicting temperature effects, particularly warming, on consumer-resource interactions in both natural and agricultural settings.									35	0	0	0	28	0	35			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000353405300010	25412342

Copper and temperature modulate predator-prey interactions in larval dragonflies and anurans								ECOSPHERE				6	4					56	10.1890/ES14-00461.1				APR 2015	2015	Amphibians are important indicators of environmental health, and their populations are in worldwide decline. The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 mu g Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22 degrees C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17 degrees C). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments. We suggest that increased concentrations of dissolved copper and elevated water temperatures are harmful to amphibian prey through maladaptive behavioral responses in the presence of predators.									20	0	1	0	21	0	22			2150-8925			WOS:000354777300011

However, the strength of NCEs should depend on the physiological and environmental contexts in which prey must choose between food and safety. For ectotherms, temperature effects on metabolism and foraging rates may shape these choices, thereby altering NCE strength. We examined NCEs in a rocky intertidal food chain across a latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient within the Gulf of Maine. The NCEs of green crabs (Carcinus maenas) on the foraging, growth, and growth efficiency of prey snails (Nucella lapillus) were consistent across a broad (similar to 8.5 A degrees C) temperature range, even though snails that were transplanted south consumed twice as many mussels (Mytilus edulis) and grew twice as much as snails that were transplanted north. The positive effects of warmer temperatures in the south allowed snails under high risk to perform similarly to or better than snails under low risk at cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that for prey populations residing at temperatures below their thermal optimum, the positive effects of future warming may offset the negative effects of predation risk. Such effects may be favorable to prey populations facing increased predation rates due to warmer temperatures associated with climate change. Attention to the direct and indirect effects of temperature on species interactions should improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on ecological communities.									23	0	0	0	21	0	23			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000350033500014	25433694

The intertidal snail Nucella ostrina risks aerial exposure at low tide to feed on the barnacle Balanus glandula. We hypothesized that N. ostrina foraging behavior would be constrained by duration and timing of low tide exposure. We added snails to intertidal blocks on San Juan Island, Washington, USA, and forced them to choose between barnacles placed on the western or eastern face of each block, or to shelter and forgo foraging. Snail behavior and barnacle mortality were monitored daily for 8 wk during summer 2011. N. ostrina foraging peaked every 2 wk, when temperature was minimized by tidal cycling. Low tide timing determined which substrate orientation was coolest and coincided with the proportion of snails foraging on one substrate face or the other: snails foraged on the western faces on days with morning low tides and on eastern faces on days with afternoon low tides. Barnacle consumption rates mirrored this spatiotemporal foraging pattern. Our conceptual model predicted mobile organism presence and location: snails foraged during the days of the tidal cycle least likely to be hot and selected the coolest available surface when foraging. These results suggest that N. ostrina alters foraging behavior to minimize risk of exposure to high temperatures or other emersion stresses. Consequently, predation on barnacles varies over space and time. This spatiotemporal behavior may buffer warming air temperatures and should be considered in models of coastal population and community dynamics.									19	1	0	0	18	0	19			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000347720100012

Determinants of diving behaviour in a marine ectotherm								ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				98				113	123		10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.018				DEC 2014	2014	Marine tetrapods represent powerful models for studying how evolutionary transitions shape the life history traits, physiology and behaviour of animals. Whereas adaptations to diving are driven primarily by the need to secure underwater food, diving in the pelagic sea snake, Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus, seems less foraging-dependent. Indeed, this reptile captures fish while floating at the sea surface. Despite knowledge about its surface ecology, its underwater behaviour remains mostly unknown. Yet, study of this life phase is a key to understanding how and why this snake dives. In this study, we reanalysed published data on its diving behaviour. The pelagic sea snake spends 95% of its time underwater, where it can dive to 50 m and stay for 3.5 h without breathing. Dives are S-shaped, with a long phase of gradual ascent during which the snake is neutrally buoyant. Snake lungs deflate slowly during this phase at a rate that increases with water temperature, and thus metabolism. Dive duration is linked to inferred lung volume at the start of the dive, suggesting aerobic diving. We propose that pelagic sea snakes dive for multiple reasons, but primarily to avoid sea surface turbulence. Underwater, they can reduce metabolism by targeting cooler water layers. By hovering in the water column, they reduce energy expenditure and escape both surface and bottom predators, while more easily locating their own prey from underneath. Some marine turtles occasionally display S-shaped dives, but the role of such dives remains under debate. We suggest the study of sea snakes can help interpret diving behaviour in other lineages of marine reptiles. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To quantify the temperature dependence of biotic interactions and evaluate predictions of metabolic theory, we: 1) compiled a database of 81 studies that provided 112 measures of rates of herbivory, predation, parasitism, parasitoidy, or competition between two species at two or more temperatures; and 2) analyzed the temperature dependence of these rates in the framework of metabolic ecology to test our prediction that the activation energy,E, centers around 0.65 eV. We focused on studies that assessed rates or associated times of entire biotic interactions, such as time to consumption of all prey, rather than rates of components of these interactions, such as prey encounter rate. Results were: 1) the frequency distribution of E for each interaction type was typically peaked and right skewed; 2) the overall mean is E= 0.96 eV and median E= 0.78 eV; 3) there was significant variation in E within but not across interaction types; but 4) average values of E were not significantly different from 0.65 eV by interaction type and 5) studies with measurements at more temperatures were more consistent with E= 0.65 eV. These synthetic findings suggest that, despite the many complicating factors, the temperature-dependence of rates of biotic interactions broadly reflect of rates of metabolism, a relationship with important implications for a warming world.									23	0	0	0	20	0	22			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000345306600005

Physiological processes in general are sensitive to temperature. Thus, the temperature at which predators and prey interact may shape physiological response to predation risk. We measured and evaluated how temperature and predation risk affected growth rates of predaceous damselfly nymphs (Enallagma vesperum, Odonata: Coenagrionidae). First, we conducted growth trials at five temperatures crossed with two levels of predation risk (fish predator present versus absent) and measured growth rates, consumption rates, assimilation efficiencies, and production efficiencies of 107 individual damselflies. Second, we used a model to evaluate if and how component physiological responses to predation risk affected growth rates across temperatures. In the absence of mortality threat, growth rates of damselflies increased with warming until about 23.5 A degrees C and then began to decline, a typical unimodal response to changes in temperature. Under predation risk, growth rates were lower and the shape of the thermal response was less apparent. Higher metabolic and survival costs induced by predation risk were only partially offset by changes in consumption rates and assimilation efficiencies and the magnitude of non-consumptive effects varied as a function of temperature. Furthermore, we documented that thermal physiology was mediated by predation risk, a known driver of organismal physiology that occurs in the context of species interactions. A general understanding of climatic impacts on ectothermic populations requires consideration of the community context of thermal physiology, including non-consumptive effects of predators.									34	1	0	0	32	1	35			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000344599000005	25234372

These interactions can change with warming, depending on the foraging mode of the predator. Theory predicts that warming increases foraging velocity in ectotherms, but in a sit-and-wait predator that has zero velocity when foraging, the interaction strength should be temperature independent. Using the protist Urocentrum turbo and the sit-and-wait copepod Orthocyclops modestus, we tested this prediction by measuring dynamic interaction strengths (effect of a predator on prey population growth rate) and by estimating the parameters of a functional response. Both of these metrics were consistent with the prediction that interaction strength is temperature independent in a sit-and-wait predator. Our results indicate that there may be considerable variability in how warming alters foraging interactions, and estimating the overall effects of climate change on food webs may require consideration of the distribution of foraging strategies and the potential asymmetries that arise with interactions that involve different strategies.									15	1	0	0	16	1	16			2150-8925			WOS:000345097200015

However, it is unclear how the effects will quantitatively differ between the plant-herbivore and herbivore-carnivore interface. To test how warming could differentially affect rates of herbivory and carnivory, we studied trophic interaction strength in a food chain comprised of green algae, herbivorous rotifers and carnivorous rotifers at 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. We found significant warming-induced changes in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous rotifers, but these responses occurred at different parts of the entire temperature gradient. The strongest response of the per capita herbivore's ingestion rate occurred due to an increase in temperature from 15 to 20 degrees C (1.9 fold: from 834 to 1611 algal cells per h(-1)) and of the per capita carnivore's ingestion rate from 20 to 25 degrees C (1.6 fold: from 1.5 to 2.5 prey h(-1)). Handling time, an important component of a consumer's functional response, significantly decreased from 15 to 20 degrees C in herbivorous rotifers. In contrast, it decreased from 20 to 25 degrees C in carnivorous rotifers. Attack rates significantly and strongly increased from 10 to 25 degrees C in the herbivorous animals, but not at all in the carnivores. Our results exemplify how the relative forces of top-down control exerted by herbivores and carnivores may strongly shift under global warming. But warming, and its magnitude, are not the only issue: If our results would prove to be representative, shifts in ectotherm interactions will quantitatively differ when a 5 degrees C increase starts out from a low, intermediate or high initial temperature. This would imply that warming could have different effects on the relative forces of carnivory and herbivory in habitats differing in average temperature, as would exist at different altitudes and latitudes.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1932-6203			WOS:000336656000011	24797506

Old world versus new world: life-history alterations in a successful invader introduced across Europe								OECOLOGIA				174	2			435	446		10.1007/s00442-013-2776-7				FEB 2014	2014	We examined differences in pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) life-history traits between native North American and introduced European populations, and tested three life-history predictions related to the effect of temperature, growth, waterbody size, and the presence/absence of predators on native and non-native populations. Pumpkinseed populations exhibit more 'opportunistic' traits (earlier maturity, smaller size at maturity, and higher reproductive allocation) in their introduced European range than those in their native range. Predictions of life-history traits were improved when indicators of juvenile growth rate (mean length at age 2), waterbody size (surface area), and thermal regime (air temperature degree-days above 10 A degrees C) were incorporated into models along with continental location, but European pumpkinseed populations exhibit more opportunistic life-history traits than North American populations even when these factors are accounted for. Native pumpkinseed in waterbodies containing piscivores mature later and at a larger size, and have lower gonadosomatic indices than those in waterbodies lacking piscivores, whereas there is no significant difference in the same three life-history traits between European waterbodies containing or lacking piscivores. Because congeneric competitors of the pumpkinseed are absent from Europe, the apparent absence of a predator life-history effect there could also be due to the absence of the major sunfish competitors. In either case, the evolution and maintenance of more opportunistic traits in European pumpkinseed can likely be attributed to enemy release, and this may explain the successful establishment and spread of pumpkinseed in many parts of Europe.									30	0	0	0	29	0	30			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000330734100011	24065557

However, the mechanisms that would underlie these predicted responses are not clear. Many studies have focused on proximate mechanisms of physiological processes affecting individual growth. One can also consider ultimate mechanisms involving adaptive explanations by evaluating temperature effects on different vital rates across the life history and using the information in a population dynamical model. Here, we combine long-term data for a top predator in freshwater ecosystems (pike; Esox lucius) with a stochastic integral projection model to analyze concurrent effects of temperature on vital rates, body size, and population dynamics. As predicted, the net effect of warming on population growth rate (fitness) is positive, but the thermal sensitivity of this rate is highly size- and vital rate--dependent. These results are not sensitive to increasing variability in temperature. Somatic growth follows the temperature-size rule, and our results support an adaptive explanation for this response. The stable length structure of the population shifts with warming toward an increased proportion of medium-sized but a reduced proportion of small and large individuals. This study highlights how demographic approaches can help reveal complex underlying mechanisms for population responses to warming.									33	0	0	0	31	0	34			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000330088400009	24464198

The ramifications of temperature for ecological communities include not only its direct effects on the physiology of individuals, but also how these effects play out in the context of other processes such as competition. Apparently idiosyncratic or difficult to predict effects of temperature on competitive outcomes are well represented in the literature. General theoretical understanding of how physiological influences of temperature filter through community dynamics to determine outcomes is limited. We present a theoretical framework for predicting the effects of temperature on competition among species, based on understanding the effects of temperature on the physiological and population parameters of the species. The approach helps unify formal resource competition theory with metabolic and physiological ecology. Phytoplankton and many other ectotherms are smaller at higher temperatures. This has been observed experimentally, across geographical gradients, and as change accompanying climate warming, but it has not been explained in terms of competition. As a case study, we apply our theoretical framework to competition for nutrients among differently sized phytoplankton. Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that the prevalence of smaller phytoplankton at higher temperatures is at least partly due to an accentuated competitive advantage of smaller cells at higher temperatures with respect to nutrient uptake and growth. We examine the scope for extending the approach to understand resource competition, generally, among ectotherms of different sizes.									40	0	0	0	36	0	40			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000328615300008	23521010

Along temperate Atlantic shorelines, the isopod Idotea balthica from high latitudes are 53% longer on average than isopods from low latitudes. When reared at 6 degrees degrees--24 degrees degrees C, juveniles increased growth and development rates with temperature. Because the increase in growth rate with temperature outstripped increases in development rate, female size at maturity increased with temperature. This thermal sensitivity of growth cannot account for the latitudinal pattern in body size. Within temperature treatments, females from low latitudes reached sexual maturity at younger ages and at a smaller size than did females from higher latitudes. This shift in life-history strategy is predicted by latitudinal declines in predation pressure, which we tested using field-tethering experiments. Overall, isopods at low latitudes had a 44% greater mortality risk from daytime predators relative to isopods at higher latitudes. We conclude that a latitudinal gradient in predation risk, not temperature, is principally responsible for Bergmann''s rule in I. balthica. Increases in body size during future warming of oceans may be constrained by local patterns of predation risk.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000322901300008	23933725

Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services.2. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate.3. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems.4. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feed-backs at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems.5. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels.6. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.									128	2	0	0	113	1	129			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000329303900016

The rate and ratio at which protein and carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38 degrees C as at 32 degrees C; however, at the higher temperature, they ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32 degrees C, and protein at 38 degrees C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T. triandra selected 32 degrees C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38 degrees C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted, locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding host-plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal-plant interactions.									53	1	0	0	51	1	53			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000319117400025	23430995	
J	Hessen, Dag O.; Daufresne, Martin; Leinaas, Hans P.								Temperature-size relations from the cellular-genomic perspective								BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				88	2			476	489		10.1111/brv.12006				MAY 2013	2013	A family of empirically based ecological rules', collectively known as temperature-size rules, predicts larger body size in colder environments. This prediction is based on studies demonstrating that a wide range of ectotherms show increased body size, cell size or genome size in low-temperature habitats, or that individuals raised at low temperature become larger than conspecifics raised at higher temperature. There is thus a potential for reduction in size with global warming, affecting all levels from cell volume to body size, community composition and food webs. Increased body size may be obtained either by increasing the size or number of cells. Processes leading to changed cell size are of great interest from an ecological, physiological and evolutionary perspective. Cell size scales with fundamental properties such as genome size, growth rate, protein synthesis rates and metabolic activity, although the causal directions of these correlations are not clear. Changes in genome size will thus, in many cases, not only affect cell or body size, but also life-cycle strategies. Symmetrically, evolutionary drivers of life-history strategies may impact growth rate and thus cell size, genome size and metabolic rates. Although this goes to the core of many ecological processes, it is hard to move from correlations to causations. To the extent that temperature-driven changes in genome size result in significant differences among populations in body size, allometry or life-cycle events such as mating season, it could serve as a fast route to speciation. We offer here a novel perspective on the temperature-size rules from a bottom-up' perspective: how temperature may induce changes in genome size, and thus implicitly in cell size and body size of metazoans. Alternatively: how temperature-driven enlargement of cells also dictates genome-size expansion to maintain the genome-size to cell-volume ratio. We then discuss the different evolutionary drivers in aquatic versus terrestrial systems, and whether it is possible to arrive at a unifying theory that also may serve as a predictive tool related to temperature changes. This, we believe, will offer an updated review of a basic concept in ecology, and novel perspectives on the basic biological responses to temperature changes from a genomic perspective.									51	2	1	0	43	0	53			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000317067900013	23551915

In agricultural systems many pests and natural enemies are arthropods. As poikilotherm organisms, their body temperature is highly dependent on environmental conditions. Because higher trophic levels typically have lower tolerance to high temperatures than lower trophic levels, trends towards increasing local or regional temperatures may affect the strength of predator/prey interactions and disrupt pest control. Furthermore, increasing temperatures may create climate corridors that could facilitate the invasion and establishment of invasive species originating from warmer areas. In this study we examined the effect of environmental conditions on the dynamics of an agro-ecosystem community located in southern Spain, using field data on predator/prey dynamics and climate gathered during four consecutive years. The study system was composed of an ever-green tree species (avocado), an exotic tetranychid mite, and two native species of phytoseiid mites found in association with this new pest. We also present a climatological analysis of the temperature trend in the area of study during the last 28 years, as evidence of temperature warming occurring in the area. We found that the range of temperatures with positive per capita growth rates was much wider in prey than in predators, and that relative humidity contributed to explain the growth rate variation in predators, but not in prey. Predator and prey differences in thermal performance curves could explain why natural enemies did not respond numerically to the pest when environmental conditions were harsh.									18	0	0	0	16	1	18			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000313653200003	22527837

Populations are structured according to size or stage. Growth, energy allocation and stage transitions are affected by environmental conditions of which temperature, photoperiod, water depth and food supply were taken into account. The resulting modelling framework was applied to describe, analyse and predict alterations in populations with continuous development, populations with distinct state structures and interacting populations. Our exemplary applications consider populations of freshwater Amphipoda, Isopoda and Odonata. The model was capable of simulating life cycle alterations in dependence on temperature in interaction with other environmental factors: (1) population dynamics, (2) seasonal regulation, (3) water depth-dependent dispersal, (4) intraguild predation and (5) consumer-resource dynamics.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000310586900019

Here we combine the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) with metabolism and consumption measurements of a model organism, the urchin Lytechinus variegatus, to test how climate change will affect consumer fitness. Unexpectedly, we found that metabolism and consumption exhibit different scaling relationships with temperature and are mismatched at high temperatures. This led to a dramatic reduction in ingestion efficiency and potentially in consumer fitness. Using meta-analysis, we showed that such temperature-driven mismatches between consumption and metabolism are common across taxa and frequently lead to reduced consumer fitness. Our empirical and synthetic analyses identify a mechanism by which climate change reduces the fitness of ectotherm consumers that may be applied to a broad array of taxonomic groups. Moreover, we showed that the assumptions of MTE do not hold at temperatures near the upper range of species' thermal tolerances for a wide array of taxa. Models using MTE to predict the effects of climate change on consumer-resource dynamics may therefore be underestimating the consequences of rising temperatures on population and community dynamics.									90	1	0	0	88	0	91			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000310834900019	23236919

Although extensive research has been carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature on animal life histories and to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds as well as the optimal temperatures for survival, development, and reproduction, few studies have investigated links between thermal window, metabolism, and trophic interactions such as predation. We developed models and conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how temperature influences predator-prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional response) using a ladybeetle larva feeding on aphid prey. As predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology, we found that handling time exponentially decreases with warming, but-in contrast with this theory-search rate follows a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. An examination of the model reveals that temperature thresholds for predation depend mainly on search rate, suggesting that predation rate is primarily determined by searching activities and secondly by prey handling. In contrast with prior studies, our model shows that per capita short-term predator-prey interaction strengths and predator energetic efficiency (per capita feeding rate relative to metabolism) generally increase with temperature, reach an optimum, and then decrease at higher temperatures. We conclude that integrating the concept of thermal windows in short- and long-term ecological studies would lead to a better understanding of predator-prey population dynamics at thermal limits and allow better predictions of global warming effects on natural ecosystems.									64	1	0	0	61	0	65			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000306494800025	22271203

The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87% are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 +/- 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle-stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 +/- 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.									405	2	0	0	367	0	406			0027-8424			WOS:000292251000046	21606358

However, little is known about the effects of temperature and food concentration on its growth and grazing. Here, using the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina as prey, we determined the specific growth rate, cell volume, specific production, and ingestion rate of C. spatiosum at different temperatures and prey concentrations. These growth and grazing parameters typically followed a hyperbolic response to prey concentration. By applying iterative curve-fitting to the data at each temperature, we found that, with increasing temperature, the maximum specific growth rate, maximum specific production, and maximum ingestion rate of C. spatiosum generally increased, while the maximum cell volume decreased. The gross growth efficiency of C. spatiosum generally decreased at saturated prey concentration from about 45 to 25% as the temperature increased from 12 to 24 degrees C. By fitting these data iteratively to multi-variable nonlinear models, we obtained predictive equations for the growth rate, cell volume, and ingestion rate with respect to temperature and prey concentration.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0948-3055			WOS:000292988300008

Behavioural, morphological and coloration plasticity are common responses of prey to predation risk. Theory predicts that prey should respond to the relative magnitude of risk, rather than a single level of response to any risk level. In addition to conspecific and predator densities, prey growth and differentiation rates affect the duration of vulnerability to size- and stage-limited predators and therefore the relative value of defences.2. We reared tadpoles of the Neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus with or without cues from a predator (Belostoma sp.) in ecologically relevant warm or cool temperatures. To track phenotypic changes, we measured morphology, tail coloration and developmental stage at three points during the larval period.3. Cues from predators interacted with growth conditions causing tadpoles to alter their phenotype, changing only tail colour in response to predators in warm water, but both morphology and colour in cool growth conditions. Tadpoles with predators in warm water altered coloration early but converged on the morphology of predator-free controls. Water temperature alone had no effect on tadpole phenotype.4. We demonstrate that seemingly small variation in abiotic environmental conditions can alter the expression of phenotypic plasticity, consistent with predictions about how growth rate affects risk. Predator-induced tadpole phenotypes depended on temperature, with strong expression only in temperatures that slow development. Thermal modulation of plastic responses to predators may be broadly relevant to poikilotherm development. It is important to include a range of realistic growth conditions in experiments to more fully understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of plasticity.									22	1	0	0	21	1	23			0021-8790			WOS:000285110600008	20964684

Here we investigate the effects of temperature on the performance of the turtle feeding apparatus in a defensive context. We measured bite force and the kinematics of snapping in the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina) over a wide range of body temperatures. Bite force performance was thermally insensitive over the broad range of temperatures typically experienced by these turtles in nature. In contrast, neck extension (velocity, acceleration, and deceleration) and jaw movements (velocity, acceleration, and deceleration) showed clear temperature dependence with peak acceleration and deceleration capacity increasing with increasing temperatures. Our results regarding the temperature dependence of defensive behavior are reflected by the ecology and overall behavior of this species. These data illustrate the necessity for carefully controlling T-b when carrying out behavioral and functional studies on turtles as temperature affects the velocity, acceleration, and deceleration of jaw and neck extension movements. More generally, these data add to the limited but increasing number of studies showing that temperature may have important effects on feeding and defensive performance in ectotherms. J. Exp.

Fuzzy regression was an accurate predictor of growth and reproduction based on the climate conditions present from 1900-2007. It predicted that the climate projections expected for Arkansas by 2100 could reduce total reproductive investment in the Blanchard's cricket frog by 33-94%. If these results reflect responses by other poikilotherms, climate change could induce major population declines in many species. Because poikilotherms represent the vast majority of vertebrates and significant ecosystem components, it is imperative that we implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and circumvent this possible catastrophe.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1827-9635	1827-9643		WOS:000280140100013

However, previous research in amphibians and other ectothermic vertebrates suggests that some morphological traits are generally insensitive to environmental inductions. We conducted a literature survey to examine the allometric responses in relative hind leg length and head shape of post-metamorphic anuran amphibians to induced environmental (temperature, resource level, predation and desiccation risk) variation operating during the larval phase in 44 studies using 19 species. To estimate and compare plastic responses across studies, we employed both an index of plasticity and effect sizes from a meta-analysis. We found contrasting trait responses to different environmental cues. Higher temperatures increased development more than growth rate and induced smaller heads but not overall shifts in hind leg length. In contrast, an increment in resource availability increased growth more than development, with a parallel increase in hind leg length but no change in head shape. Increases in predation risk decreased both development and growth rates and slightly reduced relative hind leg length, but there was no change in head shape. Pond desiccation induced quick development and low growth rates, with no changes in morphology. Across environments, both hind leg and head shape plasticity were positively correlated with growth rate plasticity. However, plasticity of developmental rate was only correlated with head shape plasticity. Overall, these results suggest that environmental trends predicted by global warming projections, such as increasing pond temperature and accelerating pond desiccation, will significantly influence hind leg and head morphology in metamorphic frogs, which may affect performance and, ultimately, fitness.									66	1	1	0	66	0	69			0936-577X	1616-1572		WOS:000280830000004

We examined the effects of temperature environment on several metamorphic characteristics in three populations of the pool frog (Rana lessonae Camerano, 1882) by rearing individuals at two temperature environments (20 and 25 degrees C). Higher temperature shortened the metamorphic period and reduced the absolute mass loss, although there was no difference between the temperatures in the percentage of mass lost. No differences among the populations were detected, but there was significant intrapopulation variation both in the mean and in the plasticity for the duration of metamorphosis. These results indicate that several aspects of metamorphosis are plastic in amphibians, these traits may have considerable intrapopulation variation, and that temperature is a strong factor affecting the process of metamorphosis.									5	0	2	0	6	0	8			0008-4301			WOS:000272031500004

Through this mechanism, environmental temperature affects individuals and populations of poikilotherms by determining rates of resource use, growth, reproduction, and mortality. Predictable variation in metabolic processes such as growth and reproduction could affect the strength of species interactions, but the community-level consequences of metabolic temperature dependence are virtually unexplored. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that plant herbivore interaction strength increases with temperature using a common species of marine macroalga (Sargassum filipendula) and the grazing amphipod Ampithoe longimana. Increasing temperature increased per capita interaction strength in two independent experiments and reversed a positive effect of temperature on plant growth. Temperature did not alter palatability of plant tissue to herbivores or average herbivore feeding rate. A predictable effect of temperature on herbivore-plant interaction strength could provide key information toward understanding local food web responses to changing temperatures at different spatial and temporal scales. Efforts to extend the effects of physiological mechanisms to larger scale patterns, including projections of the ecological effects of climate change, must be expanded to include the effects of changing conditions on trophic interactions.									198	1	0	0	187	0	200			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000263570800014	19323223	
J	Kruse, Peter Dalgas; Toft, Soren; Sunderland, Keith D.								Temperature and prey capture: opposite relationships in two predator taxa								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				33	2			305	312		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00978.x				APR 2008	2008	1. All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey.2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey.3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C).4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons. The ability of many carabid beetles to forage at low temperatures may have nutritional benefits and increases the diversity of interactions in terrestrial food webs.									41	0	0	0	40	0	41			0307-6946			WOS:000253710000019		
J	Cairns, David K.; Gaston, Anthony J.; Huettmann, Falk								Endothermy, ectothermy and the global structure of marine vertebrate communities								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				356				239	250		10.3354/meps07286				2008	2008	Birds and mammals are the leading marine predators at high latitudes, while sharks and other large fish occupy top positions in tropical waters. The present study proposes that temperature-dependent predation success (TPS) explains global patterns of marine vertebrate community structure. Burst speed increases with temperature in ectotherms but is independent of temperature in endotherms. If capture success depends on relative swimming speeds of predator and prey, ectothermic prey will be more vulnerable to attack by endothermic predators at low temperatures. Conversely, high temperatures should enhance the ability of ectothermic predators to prey on endotherms. Pursuit-diving seabirds (penguins, auks and some cormorants) and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) are ubiquitous in ocean waters with summer surface temperatures cooler than the mid-teens to low 20s (degrees C) but are virtually absent in warmer regions. We suggest that the near-absence of these animals at low latitudes is due to TPS, as warm water increases the difficulty of capturing fish prey and increases vulnerability to predation by large ectothermic and partially endothermic sharks. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are virtually absent from warm temperate and tropical waters, even where primary productivity and fisheries data suggest that food supplies are ample. This indicates that the low productivity that prevails in much of the tropical zone cannot explain the worldwide distributional patterns of pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds. Endothermy in marine communities increases with cooler temperatures and with animal size. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are sensitive to temperature limits and may suffer important range contractions as oceans warm.									29	0	0	0	29	0	33			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000254963900020

The main aim of this study was to compare the general trophic patterns with respect to continental populations of Northern Grey Shrike (Lanius excubitor) and Southern Grey Shrike. The material analysed consisted in 440 pellets collected during the four seasons of the year in the period April 2003-March 2004. A total of 5,112 prey items were identified, 85.4% corresponding to beetles (mainly Curculionidae and Tenebrionidae) and the rest consisted of other arthropods and vertebrates. Biomass mainly constituted of vertebrates, especially lizards (64.0%). Slight seasonal variations in diet were recorded, beetles and lizards being highly consumed in all seasons. A positive selection of some beetles, non-Formicidae Hymenoptera and Orthoptera (Schistocerca gregaria) was observed. The data obtained in the present study confirms the hypothesis of how the Southern Grey Shrike relies on cold-blooded prey in hot climate (e.g. south of France), while the Great Grey Shrike mainly relies on warm-blooded prey in cold climate (e.g. Scandinavian Peninsula). The importance of lizards in the diet of this insular shrike population could be related to three different ecological factors: (1) the high abundance of these ectotherm vertebrates in island environments, (2) the higher effectiveness of predation and (3) lower investment of energy to capture them.									17	0	0	0	14	0	21			0030-5685			WOS:000234595000004

Several recent studies have used common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles as models to study animal adaptation to geographic variation in ambient temperatures, but little attention has been paid to how the growth of different body parts responds to variation in temperature. We examined the variation in early growth in body. tail and relative tail length of common frog tadpoles in a common garden experiment that subjected individuals from six populations situated along a 1600-km latitudinal gradient to different temperature and food treatments. We found a high degree of latitudinally unordered inter-populational differentiation in relative tail length, and that increasing levels of environmental stress (low temperature and restricted food) lead to increased mean relative tail length. This occurred mainly because of changes in body growth, not because of changes in tail growth per se. This suggests that growth of the tail itself is less sensitive to environmental stress than body growth, but at the same time the relative length of tail can be a good indicator of growth conditions experienced by individuals. In general, the results do not support the earlier proposition that common frog tadpoles in the south have relatively longer tails due to increased risk of predation, but indirect evidence was found to support the contention that the populations along the latitudinal gradient have different thermal optima for growth as indicated by latitudinally ordered differences in how relative tail length changed in response to temperature treatments.									9	1	0	0	9	0	10			1522-0613	1937-3791		WOS:000222362000006		
J	Wintzer, AP; Motta, PJ								The effects of temperature on prey-capture kinematics of the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus): implications for feeding studies								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				82	5			794	799		10.1139/Z04-061				MAY 2004	2004	Research with ectothermic organisms has demonstrated that temperature is positively correlated with an individual's power output during locomotion. This study investigates the effect of temperature on another aspect of power output, prey-capture kinematics, of the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). Feeding sequences for two treatments of four sunfish were filmed at three temperatures (18, 24, and 30 degreesC) with one treatment (A) experiencing an increasing range of temperatures and the other (B) experiencing a decreasing temperature range. Directional temperatures affected prey-capture kinematics. The time required to achieve maximum lower jaw depression and maximum gape, as well as the duration of maximum gape, time to close the mouth (from the point of maximum gape), and the total bite duration, increased as water temperature decreased. In addition, both the time to maximum gape and the time to maximum lower jaw depression were longer at 18 degreesC for individuals in treatment A than those in treatment B. These results indicate that water temperature can bias the results of feeding studies employing kinematics that do not control for its effects as well as those that make comparisons across such studies which utilize different temperatures and taxa.									17	0	0	0	18	0	18			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000225021400015

Here we evaluate experimentally two alternative hypotheses suggested to explain life history shifts induced by raised temperature using parthenogenetic clones from two Daphnia species. Explanation 1 proposes that the life history shifts could be adaptive if increased temperature is used as an indirect cue to indicate increased risk from size-selective predators. Explanation 2 proposes that at larger body size energy becomes more limiting as temperature increases because of a less favourable assimilation: metabolism balance. In a factorial laboratory experiment we examine the effects of three rearing temperatures on the growth and reproductive traits of Daphnia raised in water with fish kairomone, Chaoborus kairomone, or in uncontaminated water. None of the three predictions of explanation 1 were met by the data. In both D. pulex and D. curvirostris, and some other published studies, data suggested that at larger body sizes the sum of growth and reproduction was lower at high temperature, supporting our prediction from explanation 2. However, we propose a novel third explanation based on new evidence of temperature-dependence in both reproductive effort and cost in D. pulex.									37	1	0	0	33	0	38			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000188987800001

Do thermal factors influence foraging-site selection by ectothermic predators? Snake species that obtain their prey from ambush must remain immobile for long periods, precluding overt behavioural thermoregulation; and some "ambush" snakes use thermal cues to detect endothermic prey. Plausibly, alternative ambush sites might differ either in equilibrial body temperatures available to snakes, or in the thermal "background" against which prey items must be detected.2. We examined this topic with field data on pit-vipers (Gloydius shedaoensis) on a small island in northeastern China. Adult snakes feed only on migrating passerine birds. The snakes ambush birds both from arboreal perches (branches of small trees) and from the ground.3. Arboreal versus terrestrial ambush sites differed both in operative temperatures and thermal "backgrounds" available to the snakes. Operative temperatures inside copper models were lower in trees than on the ground (because of wind), and snakes in arboreal ambush sites were cooler than those in terrestrial sites. Thermal backgrounds from arboreal perches were cooler (and thus, provided more contrast against prey items) than did backgrounds available from terrestrial ambush-sites.4. Thermal factors thus modify the suitability of alternative ambush locations for these pit-vipers, but with a trade-off: a snake in a tree can "see" its prey more clearly, but may not be warm enough (and hence, able to strike fast enough) to capture it. Further work is required to determine whether or not snakes actually use such thermal differences as criteria for the selection of ambush sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The ways that fluctuations in prey abundance and weather conditions can affect reproductive output in a 'capital breeding' ectotherm, the aspic viper ( Vipera aspis) were examined.2. Our longitudinal study confirms that female aspic vipers adjust reproductive investment by integrating allocations of energy from stores ('capital') and facultative feeding ('income'). Thus, long-term energy storage enabled females to reproduce successfully even in years when prey were scarce.3. Not surprisingly, temporal changes in body reserves of female vipers preparing for reproduction depended upon current feeding rates. However, the mean environmental temperature during the active season also affected mass gain.4. Allometric patterns suggest that reproductive output was limited by energy availability in 8 out of the 9 years of our study. In the other year, high prey availability in the preceding season meant that reproductive output was maximized within the constraints set by maternal body size (and thus, abdominal volume).5. High summer temperatures increased basking opportunities of gravid vipers and thus accelerated gestation. However, maternal metabolic costs also increased in such situations, resulting in low postpartum body condition.									99	0	0	0	99	0	102			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000175536600009		
J	Rohr, DH; Malone, BS					Rohr, Detlef/0000-0001-9780-2410			Activity times and body temperature in Australian copperheads (Serpentes : Elapidae)								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				49	3			223	233		10.1071/ZO01018				2001	2001	Local climatic conditions influence the way in which ectotherms regulate their body temperature and activity. We examined correlations between local climatic conditions, body temperature and activity in adult, basking lowland copperheads (Austrelaps superbus) from two localities (warm-temperate versus cool-temperate) in south-eastern Australia. We also collected data from highland copperheads (Austrelaps ramsayi) at a locality with cold-temperate climate. We found that across the active season, mean body temperatures were similar among localities (approximately 27 degreesC) irrespective of species. In contrast, activity times differed. Cool-temperate A. superbus emerged earlier in spring and in the morning and retreated earlier in the evening and in autumn than their conspecifics from the warm-temperate locality. Spring emergence was correlated with yearly fluctuations in thermal conditions, suggesting that activity times depend on environmental temperatures. Predator-prey interactions influenced body temperature and activity to some extent in spring when warm-temperate A. superbus with relatively low body temperatures (as low as 18.5 degreesC) were captured around ponds in which they had been foraging for frogs. Austrelaps ramsayi from the cold-temperate locality not only displayed a later emergence in spring and reduced daily activity times compared with warm and cool-temperate A. superbus but also compared with A. ramsayi, as reported from a warmer locality in eastern Australia. These data indicate that activity times vary on a geographic basis while snake body temperatures largely remain inflexible. The surprising exception was that cold-temperate A. ramsayi retreated later in autumn than cool-temperate A. superbus, and at that time they showed body temperatures as low as 12.5 degreesC, well below those we had recorded for A. superbus. We suggest that A. ramsayi retreat later in autumn because they need to extend their reproductive season and that this is mediated via adaptive changes in the critical minimum body temperature, as has been reported for other snakes.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0004-959X	1446-5698		WOS:000170397000003

In a first experiment, groups of recently fed guppies, placed in a novel environment, schooled significantly more closely at 26 degrees than at 22 degrees C. Changes in two of three measures of schooling tendency over time indicated that aggregation increased during the trial periods, probably as a result of increased familiarity within the experimental groups. In a second experiment, pairs of female guppies were tested at 22 degrees and 26 degrees C, with and without predation threat from a confined cichlid. From multifactor analysis of 18 behaviour types, temperature was shown to affect behavioural time budgets profoundly, particularly in the presence of the predator. At the higher temperature, a shift occurred from inactive anti-predator behaviours and minimal foraging activity towards active predator inspection-related behaviours and a much higher level of feeding. Guppies in the warmer water might have been physically able to school more closely as a result of faster swimming ability, or might have used temperature as a cue indicating higher potential predation risk, and aggregated accordingly. The use of temperature as a source of information about the biotic environment is discussed.

J	Dickson, KA								Locomotor muscle of high performance fishes: What do comparisons of tunas with ectothermic sister taxa reveal?								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-PHYSIOLOGY				113	1			39	49		10.1016/0300-9629(95)02056-X				JAN 1996	1996	Many studies of high-performance fishes focus on tunas because they are morphologically adapted for efficient swimming, they migrate long distances and accelerate rapidly, and they successfully exploit the epipelagic marine environment. Tunas have also received attention because, by conserving metabolically generated heat, they elevate the temperature of certain tissues above ambient water temperature; that is, they are endothermic. However, few studies have used phylogenetically based comparisons to determine what is unique about tunas and to elucidate evolutionary trends. This paper compares tunas with their closest relatives, ectothermic fishes of the family Scombridae, and examines characteristics of the myotomal musculature that are related to swimming performance. White muscle anaerobic capacity is significantly greater in tunas chan in ectothermic scombrid fishes, indicating that energy generation for bursts may be greater in tunas. Because tunas have high capacities to buffer metabolic acids within the white muscle and blood, and to recover from exhaustive exercise rapidly, they may be able to burst repeatedly. The white muscle of tunas also has a higher aerobic capacity than that of ectothermic scombrids, which may indicate chat at lease some tuna white muscle fibers are recruited at sustainable speeds or it may be related to rapid lactate turnover or growth races. In contrast, many intracellular characteristics of the red myotomal muscle do not differ significantly between tunas and ectothermic scombrid fishes. Many of these, including mitochondrial ATP production rate and muscle contraction speed, are temperature dependent and are higher at. the higher in vivo red muscle temperatures of tunas. Thus, endothermy may result in elevated aerobic performance levels in tunas, and their high blood hemoglobin concentrations, muscle myoglobin contents, and red muscle capillary densities would ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the active, warm red muscle fibers. However, direct tests of this hypothesis are needed. Much more remains to be learned about tunas and ectothermic scombrids so that more complete phylogenetic analyses can be used to understand the adaptive strategies that have resulted in tunas' success as active epipelagic predators.

Lacertid lizards are insectivorous ectotherms whose energy requirements and food consumption rates are relatively much lower. Maximizing the net rate of energy intake (profitability) may, therefore, be just an optional strategy for these small ectotherms. Nevertheless, lacertids exhibit precisely defined patterns of prey selection. They are selective in the sizes of the prey they capture, and mean prey size (but not profitability, counterbalanced by the longer times required for handling the larger prey) is a good predictor of prey selection in most of the species examined. The foraging choices of lacertid lizards represent complex behavioural responses, in which at least the following factors may be involved: (1) time constraints, related to reproductive cycles, that seem to favour time minimization in the breeding season; (2) movement minimization in the postbreeding season; (3) nutrient optimization; (4) predation risk that may force lizards to balance between the conflicting demands of feeding and avoiding danger; and (5) body temperature, whose effects on lizard performance may cause temperature dependent shifts in prey choice and feeding behaviour.									20	1	0	0	17	0	21			0268-0130			WOS:A1995RK05200002

Of 61 studies of aquatic ectotherms, increased rearing temperature (apparently not stressful for growth and development) caused a reduction in organism size at a given developmental stage in 55 cases (90.2%) and an increase in only six (9.8%).2. The six exceptions to the size-reduction rule included one diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum), one copepod (Salmincola salmoneus) and four species of mayfly (Ephemeroptera). The extent to which these exceptions could be explained by each of four mechanisms was investigated by comparing their life cycles and niches with those of other closely-related species.3. No satisfactory explanation could be found for the response of P. tricornutum, but mechanisms consistent with the response of S. salmoneus were: reduced risk of oxygen shortage, low risk of ectotherm predation and seasonal constraints on the life cycle. The latter may also help explain the four mayfly exceptions.

Rearing temperature may affect juvenile mortality, growth and development rates, adult mortality rate, and/or population growth rate. Increased juvenile growth rate may affect the trade-off curve relating fecundity to development period, lowering it and making it less steep. Here we identify the overall effects of temperature on optimal adult size. Larger bodies are favoured by decreased juvenile mortality rate and decreased population growth rate (the sum of these is termed discounted juvenile mortality rate).2. The effects of the other variables depend on whether environmental heterogeneity is spatial or temporal. Under spatial heterogeneity larger adult bodies are favoured by increased juvenile growth rate but varying adult mortality rate has no effect. Under temporal heterogeneity larger adult bodies are favoured by increased adult mortality rate but the effects of juvenile growth rate depend on the details of the changes in the fecundity-development period trade-off curve.3. If discounted juvenile mortality rate does not increase at higher temperatures, some of these predictions are hard to reconcile with the finding that higher rearing temperatures generally result in smaller adult bodies. Using available data, we conclude that temperature effects on juvenile growth in spatially heterogeneous environments, and on adult mortality in temporally heterogeneous environments, would generally predict larger rather than smaller size.4. Predictions involving juvenile mortality and population growth rate are also evaluated using the available data, and mechanisms linking temperature to increased juvenile mortality are discussed. They include increased molecular damage, ectotherm predation and parasitism, drought and oxygen shortage.									168	1	0	0	162	2	173			0269-8463			WOS:A1994PA05600009

Prey capture by these spiders involves a foray from a cool subterranean retreat to the undersurface of a capture web that can be lethally hot. Striking, disentangling and retrieving prey from the capture web typically involves several short trips to the capture web, alternating with retreats to the cool burrow. It has been suggested that this behavior limits the increase of body temperature a spider must experience while working at the hot capture web. We used biophysical models ih conjunction with direct observations of prey-capture behavior and distributions of sand temperature to estimate body temperatures experienced by S. henscheli during prey capture. In the circumstances we observed, only the relatively long post-strike retreat from the capture web is important in keeping spiders' body temperatures from exceeding their lethal limits. After the post-strike retreat, shuttling appreciably limits the increase in body temperature of small individuals, but may have little effect on body temperature increase in larger spiders.									14	0	0	0	14	0	15			0340-5443			WOS:A1993LP94700004

One factor affecting the magnitude of the lift force is the area of the propulsor. Resistance to cruising and sprints is mainly due to drag, but inertia is important during maneuvers when animals accelerate or turn. The inertia of the body and entrained water, which is proportional to body volume, resists acceleration. Because a thrust that is proportional to surface area is used to maneuver a resistance that is proportional to volume, acceleration performance and maneuverability are expected to decline with increasing size. This trend is ameliorated to some extent by the high swimming speeds attainable by warm-bodied vertebrates and the reduced resistance to acceleration characteristic of the skeletons of dolphins and ichthyosaurs. Maneuvers are essential for capture of elusive prey and avoidance of predators. As they increase in size, aquatic vertebrates use various means to ensure that their prey are less maneuverable than they. These include consumption of increasingly smaller prey relative to predator body size (culminating in filter feeding by the largest aquatic vertebrates); behaviors to concentrate, disturb, and disorient prey; and ambushing or suction feeding that avoid whole-body acceleration. Advantages of warm muscles are seen in the ability of endotherms to take more maneuverable prey than can ectotherms of teh same size. Young stages of large aquatic vertebrates could be especially vulnerable to predators; viviparity or spawning in productive patches provides for rapid growth through vulnerable stages.									74	0	0	0	65	0	75			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:A1990EQ37000008
