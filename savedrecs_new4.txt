Several recent studies have used common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles as models to study animal adaptation to geographic variation in ambient temperatures, but little attention has been paid to how the growth of different body parts responds to variation in temperature. We examined the variation in early growth in body. tail and relative tail length of common frog tadpoles in a common garden experiment that subjected individuals from six populations situated along a 1600-km latitudinal gradient to different temperature and food treatments. We found a high degree of latitudinally unordered inter-populational differentiation in relative tail length, and that increasing levels of environmental stress (low temperature and restricted food) lead to increased mean relative tail length. This occurred mainly because of changes in body growth, not because of changes in tail growth per se. This suggests that growth of the tail itself is less sensitive to environmental stress than body growth, but at the same time the relative length of tail can be a good indicator of growth conditions experienced by individuals. In general, the results do not support the earlier proposition that common frog tadpoles in the south have relatively longer tails due to increased risk of predation, but indirect evidence was found to support the contention that the populations along the latitudinal gradient have different thermal optima for growth as indicated by latitudinally ordered differences in how relative tail length changed in response to temperature treatments.									9	1	0	0	9	0	10			1522-0613	1937-3791		WOS:000222362000006

Population densities of the various ampeliscid species are regulated by a balance between required carbon flux rates to the seafloor, predation rates, competition for space and reproductive potential. The largest taxa require high organic matter input and low predation rates to mature and reproduce. Reductions in organic matter flux favor smaller taxa. Low predation rates favor larger taxa, which can out-compete the smaller taxa for available space. High predation rates favor smaller taxa, which have a higher reproductive rate and are therefore more effective colonizers. The above factors can explain the relative concentrations of Ampelisca macrocephala, Ampelisca birulai and Byblis spp., the most abundant ampeliscids in the northern Bering Sea. Elevated predation losses to gray whales will depress the density of the large-sized A. macrocephala populations and increase the density of the smallest species, A. birulai. Global warming should elevate ampeliscid food requirements, and may also lead to elevated predation rates, both selecting for smaller species.									25	0	0	0	13	0	25			0171-8630			WOS:A1994NJ48400003

Zooplankton distribution and migration in low-oxygen modewater eddies								BIOGEOSCIENCES				13	6			1977	1989		10.5194/bg-13-1977-2016				2016	2016	The eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) features a mesopelagic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) at approximately 300-600 m depth. Here, oxygen concentrations rarely fall below 40 mu mol O-2 kg(-1), but are expected to decline under future projections of global warming. The recent discovery of mesoscale eddies that harbour a shallow suboxic (< 5 mu mol O-2 kg(-1)) OMZ just below the mixed layer could serve to identify zooplankton groups that may be negatively or positively affected by ongoing ocean deoxygenation. In spring 2014, a detailed survey of a suboxic anticyclonic mode-water eddy (ACME) was carried out near the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO), combining acoustic and optical profiling methods with stratified multinet hauls and hydrography. The multinet data revealed that the eddy was characterized by an approximately 1.5-fold increase in total area-integrated zooplankton abundance. At nighttime, when a large proportion of acoustic scatterers is ascending into the upper 150 m, a drastic reduction in mean volume backscattering (S-v) at 75 kHz (shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler, ADCP) within the shallow OMZ of the eddy was evident compared to the nighttime distribution outside the eddy. Acoustic scatterers avoided the depth range between approximately 85 to 120 m, where oxygen concentrations were lower than approximately 20 mu mol O-2 kg(-1), indicating habitat compression to the oxygenated surface layer. This observation is confirmed by time series observations of a moored ADCP (upward looking, 300 kHz) during an ACME transit at the CVOO mooring in 2010. Nevertheless, part of the diurnal vertical migration (DVM) from the surface layer to the mesopelagic continued through the shallow OMZ. Based upon vertically stratified multinet hauls, Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5) and ADCP data, four strategies followed by zooplankton in response to in response to the eddy OMZ have been identified: (i) shallow OMZ avoidance and compression at the surface (e.g. most calanoid copepods, euphausiids); (ii) migration to the shallow OMZ core during daytime, but paying O-2 debt at the surface at nighttime (e.g. siphonophores, Oncaea spp., eucalanoid copepods); (iii) residing in the shallow OMZ day and night (e.g. ostracods, polychaetes); and (iv) DVM through the shallow OMZ from deeper oxygenated depths to the surface and back. For strategy (i), (ii) and (iv), compression of the habitable volume in the surface may increase prey-predator encounter rates, rendering zooplankton and micronekton more vulnerable to predation and potentially making the eddy surface a foraging hotspot for higher trophic levels. With respect to long-term effects of ocean deoxygenation, we expect avoidance of the mesopelagic OMZ to set in if oxygen levels decline below approximately 20 mu mol O-2 kg(-1). This may result in a positive feedback on the OMZ oxygen consumption rates, since zooplankton and micronekton respiration within the OMZ as well as active flux of dissolved and particulate organic matter into the OMZ will decline.									21	0	0	0	13	0	21			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000377274100016

Recently hatched larvae were placed individually in Petri dishes, fed ad libitum with S. flava and reared at either 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 or 32 +/- 1 degrees C, a RH of 70 +/- 10% and a 12-h photophase. The experiment was fully randomized with 30 replicates of each treatment. The duration and survival in each instar, and larval and pupal stages (pre-pupa + pupa) were analyzed. To determine the predatory capacity of larvae they were each provided daily with three-day-old nymphs of the aphid, in a number greater than they could consume. Ninety C. externa larvae were kept individually in Petri dishes at 24 +/- 1 degrees C, and their daily consumption recorded during development. Temperature influenced the rate of larval and pupal development. There was a decrease in the duration of development with increase in temperature. Regression analyses, based on quadratic equations, were used to describe the effect of temperature on the duration of development in the different instars of C. externa. This revealed that the base temperature increased as the larvae developed towards the adult phase. The survival of larvae in the first and second instars was similar at 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 degrees C but none of the third instar larvae completed their development at 12 degrees C and 32 degrees C. The average daily and total consumption of aphids by third instar larvae was about 48 times greater than that of first instar larvae. The larvae ate an average of 10, 37 and 479 aphids in the first, second and third instars, respectively.									6	0	0	0	5	2	7				1802-8829		WOS:000276310400006

Body size is of fundamental importance to the structure and function of natural systems, yet the factors selecting for certain body sizes are still not well understood. Resource supply levels clearly play a role in setting size, but in current theory, optimality functions for body size are not tied to the population dynamics that govern resource supply, minimizing our ability to understand how body size evolves in response to the ecological context.2. We integrated the supply-demand (SD) model of body size evolution with a model of predator-prey dynamics to create a dynamic SD model that describes predator body size variation through time. We tested the model with experimental data on body size and abundance dynamics in the Didinium-Paramecium predator-prey system. We used a new differential equation fitting approach along with independently estimated parameters to determine whether the model could simultaneously capture both abundance and body size dynamics.3. The dynamics were well described by the model, supporting the notion that body size changes to match bodily demand for resources with the available supply of resources. Surprisingly, despite the 10-fold variation in Didinium body size, we found that static model parameters were sufficient to describe the data, suggesting a lack of eco-evolutionary dynamics.4. A pressing need in ecology is to be able to predict changes in body size under novel scenarios, especially climate warming. The dynamic SD model does this by linking body size to the ecological context in an eco-evolutionary framework. Our approach expands our ability to understand rapid linked changes in traits and abundance.									32	0	0	0	29	0	32			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000332777500021

In the study area, this invasive Lessepsian fish showed piscivorous behaviour, focusing mainly on labrids, clupeids and sparids. Prey composition suggests that bluespotted cometfish explores various habitats for hunting. Prey fishes were mainly juveniles and their size showed positive correlation with predator size. Estimated by vertebrae readings, ages of bluespotted cornetfish, having sizes from 73.0 to 107.5 cm total length, ranged from 2 to 4 years; these are the first estimates of age for this species. The parameters of von Bertalanffy growth curves were L-infinity = 102.39 cm, k = 0.49 year(-1), t(o) = 0.57 years. The analysis of growth rates indicates that bluespotted cometfish is a fast-growing species. Growth performance index was phi' = 3.71, and weight-length relationship, W = 0.0001 x TL3.372 (R-2 = 0.857), described positive allometric growth of F. commersonii.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0399-0974			WOS:000336107600003

We assessed the bottom up cascading effect from edible zooplankton to its consumer M. leidyi and its predator B. ovata. For these purposes, we used life cycles of both ctenophores (ova, larva, juvenile, transitional and adult stages), variability of annual phenology and physiological features obtained from our field observations and experiments made in the northeastern Black Sea over 27 years, combined with a long-term change in temperature and food availability for both ctenophores.Model outputs were compared with field observations. Then, model scenarios were tested to understand which environmental conditions control M. leidyi and B. ovate development. Using our model, we found that the maximum annual abundances of M. leidyi and B. ovata increased with mean springtime temperature and development of spring-early summer zooplankton which is important for creation of M. leidyi abundance and consequently development of B. ovate. An assessment with changing concentration of the M. leidyi food (i.e. zooplankton) at the time of its annual development changed the maximum annual values reached by M. leidyi, and consequently B. ovate. It was found that time of appearance of B. ovata had changed to May since 2012 with increasing temperature, and as a result M. leidyi did not have time to reach high abundance, being grazed by B. ovate already since May. Model results were qualitatively the same as those from long-term field observations.As a result, we obtained a model of two ctenophores interacting with total life structure: duration and scale of reproduction, growing from stage to stage, mortality, seasonal disappearance from water depending on temperature and prey availability. Similar analyses have never been done in the Black Sea and can be used for other seas where M. leidyi or both ctenophores invaded.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000431096500001

Using invertebrates in microcosms, we characterise phenotypic, population and evolutionary dynamics before, during and after exposure to a novel environment and harvesting over 20 generations. We demonstrate an evolved change in life-history traits (the age- and size-at-maturity, and survival to maturity) in response to selection caused by environmental change (wild to laboratory) and to harvesting (juvenile or adult). Life-history evolution, which drives changes in population growth rate and thus population dynamics, includes an increase in age-to-maturity of 76% (from 12.5 to 22days) in the unharvested populations as they adapt to the new environment. Evolutionary responses to harvesting are outweighed by the response to environmental change (similar to 1.4 vs. 4% change in age-at-maturity per generation). The adaptive response to environmental change converts a negative population growth trajectory into a positive one: an example of evolutionary rescue.									49	0	0	0	46	0	49			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000318996400005	23565666

A short period of heat stress is unlikely to cause directly mortality but may modify population dynamics via impacting life history traits. In this study, the newly-emerged female and male adults of the predatory mite, Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes (Acari: Phytoseiidae) were exposed to 42 degrees C for 4 hours to investigate the heat effects on the copulation, longevity, fecundity and egg hatchability through parental effects of the mite. The results showed that after heat stress, the females had a markedly extended pre-oviposition period, shortened oviposition period, and reduced fecundity and longevity. At the meantime, when females mated with the heat stressed males, the pre-oviposition period was prolonged, the oviposition period was shortened and the fecundity was reduced. A sex-specific effect of short term heat exposure on mating behavior was further observed in males where copulation duration of the stressed individuals were somewhat prolonged. In addition, a trade-off between survival and reproduction was observed in heat stressed females. However, heat stress had no effects on immediate mortality, pre-copulation period, post-oviposition period, male longevity and egg hatchability of the progeny generations. Our results confirmed that heat stress had a detrimental effect on reproduction, particularly by delaying the onset of oviposition and reducing reproductive output and thereby influencing the population dynamics of N. barkeri.									14	1	0	0	13	0	15			1362-1971			WOS:000373924500005

Recently, animal-borne video cameras have revealed the diet of marine mammals that make short foraging trips. However, novel approaches that allocate video time to target prey capture events is required to obtain diet information for species that make long foraging trips over great distances. We combined satellite telemetry and depth recorders with newly developed date-/time-, depth- and acceleration-triggered animal-borne video cameras to examine the diet of female northern elephant seals during their foraging migrations across the eastern North Pacific. We obtained 48.2 h of underwater video, from cameras mounted on the head (n=12) and jaw (n=3) of seals. Fish dominated the diet (78% of 697 prey items recorded) across all foraging locations (range: 37-55 degrees N, 122-152 degrees W), diving depths (range: 238-1167 m) and water temperatures (range: 3.2-7.4 degrees C), while squid comprised only 7% of the diet. Identified prey included fish such as myctophids, Merluccius sp. and Icosteus aenigmaticus, and squid such as Histioteuthis sp., Octopoteuthis sp. and Taningia danae. Our results corroborate fatty acid analysis, which also found that fish are more important in the diet, and are in contrast to stomach content analyses that found cephalopods to be the most important component of the diet. Our work shows that in situ video observation is a useful method for studying the at-sea diet of long-ranging marine predators.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000541826200013	32041802

The ratio of slow and fast developers within an egg batch differed with thermal extremes irrespective of Fl and F15 generations. Adult body mass got depressed after selection for control slow developers at 15 degrees C while it got enhanced for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C. More selected slow developers were found at low temperature and more selected fast developers at high temperature. Selection probably favours the enhancement of immature survival and emergence ratio which was found to be highest for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C and selected slow developers at 15 degrees C. Population level disparity on thermal confliction was observed in ladybird post selection over several generations. Therefore, we put forward that exposure thermal extremes over a long duration, causes an adaptive differentiation in thermal responses of slow and fast developers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000413799200037	29037394

Microfibres are among the most pervasive pollutants in the marine environment, including in the Southern Ocean. However, evidence for microfibre contamination in the diet of top predators in the Southern Ocean is rare. King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feed on mesopelagic fish, which undergo diel vertical migrations towards the surface at night. Microfibres are concentrated in surface waters and sediments but can also be concentrated in fish, therefore acting as contamination vectors for diving predators feeding at depth. In this study, we investigate microfibre contamination of King Penguin faecal samples collected in February and March 2017 at South Georgia across three groups: incubating, chick-rearing and non-breeding birds. After a KOH digestion to dissolve the organic matter and a density separation step using a NaCl solution, the samples were filtered to collect microfibres. A total of 77% of the penguin faecal samples (36 of 47) contained microfibres. Fibres were measured and characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy to determine their polymeric identity. Most fibres (88%) were made of natural cellulosic materials (e.g. cotton, linen), with only 12% synthetic (e.g. polyester, nylon) or semi-synthetic (e.g. rayon). An average of 21.9 +/- 5.8 microfibres g(-1) of faeces (lab dried mass) was found, with concentrations more than twice as high in incubating penguins than in penguins rearing chicks. Incubating birds forage further north at the Antarctic Polar Front and travel longer distances from South Georgia than chick-rearing birds. This suggests that long-distance travelling penguins are probably more exposed to the risk of ingesting microfibres when feeding north of the Antarctic Polar Front, which might act as a semi-permeable barrier for microfibres. Microfibres could therefore provide a signature for foraging location in King Penguins.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12			0160-4120	1873-6750		WOS:000501344500051	31726359

Amphibians, with complex life cycles, are particularly susceptible to habitat alterations, and their survival may be impaired in anthropized habitats. Increased mortality is a vvell-knovvn consequence of anthropization. Life-history theory predicts higher reproductive investment when mortality is increased. In this work, we compared age, body size, and different indicators of reproductive investment, as well as prey availability, in natterjack toads (Epidalea calamita) from agrosysterns and adjacent natural pine groves in Southwestern Spain. Mean age was lower in agrosysterns than in pine groves, possibly as a consequence of increased mortality due to agrosystem environmental stressors. Remarkably, agrosystem toads were larger despite being younger, suggesting accelerated growth rate. Although we detected no differences in prey availability between habitats, artificial irrigation could shorten aestivation in agrosysterns, thus increasing energy trade. Moreover, agrosystem toads exhibited increased indicators of reproductive linvestment. In the light of life history theory, agrosystern toads might compensate for lesser reproductive events due to shorter lives with a higher reproductive investment in each attempt.

Exploration of alewife early life history dynamics within these different habitats should help identify important recruitment processes. During 2001-2003, we quantified physical (temperature, transparency) and biotic (chlorophyll a, zooplankton densities) habitat factors and collected age-0 alewives (using ichthyoplankton nets and trawls) in a nearshore region of Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake, Michigan (a drowned river mouth lake connected to Lake Michigan). We characterized alewife hatch dates, individual condition, growth, mortality, and size-dependent overwinter survival to infer differences in habitat-specific recruitment success. Temperature, turbidity, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and densities of zooplankton prey were consistently higher in Muskegon Lake than in nearshore Lake Michigan. On average, young alewives in Muskegon Lake hatched earlier, grew faster, were in better condition (based on a biphasic length-weight relationship), and had greater survival than alewives in Lake Michigan. By the end of the growing season, young alewives in Muskegon Lake obtained a larger size than those residing in nearshore Lake Michigan, suggesting that they were more likely to survive through winter (a period of intense size-selective mortality) and ultimately recruit to the adult population.									38	0	0	0	34	0	39			0002-8487			WOS:000250184600013		
J	Thingstad, T. Frede								How trophic cascades and photic zone nutrient content interact to generate basin-scale differences in the microbial food web								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				77	5			1639	1647		10.1093/icesjms/fsaa028				SEP 2020	2020	In linear food chains, resource and predator control produce positive and negative correlations, respectively, between biomass at adjacent trophic levels. These simple relationships become more complex in food webs that contain alternative food chains of unequal lengths. We have used a "minimum" model for the microbial part of the pelagic food web that has three such food chains connecting free mineral nutrients to copepods: via diatoms, autotrophic flagellates, and heterotrophic bacteria. Trophic cascades from copepods strongly modulates the balance between the three pathways and, therefore, the functionality of the microbial food web in services such as food production for higher trophic levels, DOM degradation, and ocean carbon sequestration. The result is a theoretical framework able to explain, not only apparent conflicts in Arctic mesocosm experiments, but also biogeochemical features of the Mediterranean. Here, the fundamental difference between Arctic and Mediterranean microbial food webs is the way they are predator driven by seasonal migration of large copepods in the Arctic, but resource driven due to the anti-estuarine circulation in the Mediterranean. In this framework, global change effects on microbial ecosystem functions are more like to come indirectly through changes in these drivers than through direct temperature effects on the microbes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000582719500005

From the experiments with krill. where no internal tagging was possible, the medians and upper quartiles of the stomach content distributions were analysed instead of individual data. From these experiment the evacuation rate of krill as 60%, higher than that of sandeel.

Most Northwest Atlantic stocks declined to low levels during the 1970s, but increased during the 1980s before declining even more severely during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Several of these stocks have shown little recovery despite severe restrictions on directed fishing. Many stocks in the Northeast Atlantic have experienced sustained increases and sustained decreases, but generally not in concert. Among-stock comparisons illustrate that fishing has played a dominant role in the dynamics of all cod stocks, but variability in climate has contributed to variability in recruitment, individual growth, and natural mortality. A cooling event during the last three decades of the twentieth century contributed to the rapid decline of several stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, and changes in life-history traits (growth rate, age and size at maturity) and in the biotic environment (predators and prey) may be contributing to recovery being slow.

Effects of dietary fatty acids on juvenile salmon growth, biochemistry, and aerobic performance: A laboratory rearing experiment								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				494				20	31		10.1016/j.jembe.2017.04.007				SEP 2017	2017	A three-phase experiment measured the effects of prey quality and fasting on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) performance. The first phase was designed to evaluate the effect of dietary levels of two essential fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), on salmon growth. Salmon were reared for 12 weeks on three diets varying in proportions of krill (Thysanoessa spinifera and Euphausia pacifica) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Supplements of DHA and EPA were added to the formulated diets to achieve DHA:EPA ratios (0.6, 0.9, and 1.5) representative of naturally occurring prey. Growth rates over 12 weeks were not significantly different among diet treatments, which may be because DHA and EPA were provisioned at or above minimum requirements. Salmon maintained DHA at high levels (> 20% of total fatty acids) across all treatments and sampling periods, whereas EPA reflected dietary concentrations after 12 weeks. Fatty acids were incorporated into salmon muscle at varying rates but on average reflected diet after 1 to 2 months, similar to bulk stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. The second phase of the experiment was designed to evaluate fasting effects on salmon size, growth, and lipid storage over 4 weeks. Fed fish were heavier, grew faster, and had significantly more storage lipids than fasted fish. The third phase was designed to evaluate aerobic performance in fasted fish. Critical swim speeds were found to be positively related to salmon body size and storage lipids, but not prior diet quality, evidence that larger salmon with higher energy reserves may be better suited for overwinter survival due to their ability to swim faster than smaller leaner individuals. These results provide mechanistic support for the idea that body condition prior to the first ocean winter is important for juvenile salmon survival.									6	0	0	0	9	0	9			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000404196100003

We review available data on distribution and community ecology to assess the functional role of Idotea in the Baltic Sea and how global change may affect essential ecological interactions. Data from the last 150 years suggest an on-going shift southward for I. chelipes and I. granulosa that may be caused by a changing climate. Several studies report local extinctions and mass abundances, which may be caused by a changing food web from over-fishing and eutrophication. The three species of Idotea have clear habitat segregation in the Baltic Sea, where salinity, temperature and vegetation are the main dimensions. Idotea spp. have a central role as grazers and in communities dominated by the perennial macrophytes Fucus spp. and Zostera marina and attain impressive feeding rates on a range of epiphytes/filamentous algae (top-down effect). Idotea can have both a direct negative grazing effect on macrophytes but also an indirect positive effect by removing epiphytes. The relative role of nutritional value and chemical defence for food preference is yet unclear for Idotea. Baltic idoteids are also important prey for several fish (bottom-up effect) and fish predation may have increased following overfishing of piscivorous fish. It is concluded that Idotea is a key taxon in the Baltic Sea food web, where guilds often contain few dominant species. Changes in population dynamics of Idotea, as a function of human generated global change, may have large-scale consequences for ecosystem functions in a future Baltic Sea, e.g. the extent of vegetation cover in the coastal zone.									33	0	0	0	34	0	34			0278-0372	1937-240X		WOS:000304839800003

Effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 on leaf damage and insect abundance in a soybean agroecosystem								ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS				2	3			125	135		10.1007/s11829-008-9045-4				SEP 2008	2008	By altering myriad aspects of leaf chemistry, increasing concentrations of CO2 and O-3 in the atmosphere derived from human activities may fundamentally alter the relationships between insect herbivores and plants. Because exposure to elevated CO2 can alter the nutritional value of leaves, some herbivores may increase consumption rates to compensate. The effects of O-3 on leaf nutritional quality are less clear; however, increased senescence may also reduce leaf quality for insect herbivores. Additionally, changes in secondary chemistry and the microclimate of leaves may render plants more susceptible to herbivory in elevated CO2 and O-3. Damage to soybean (Glycine max L.) leaves and the size and composition of the insect community in the plant canopy were examined in large intact plots exposed to elevated CO2 (similar to 550 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated O-3 (1.2* ambient) in a fully factorial design with a Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment system (SoyFACE). Leaf area removed by folivorous insects was estimated by digital photography and insect surveys were conducted during two consecutive growing seasons, 2003 and 2004. Elevated CO2 alone and in combination with O-3 increased the number of insects and the amount of leaf area removed by insect herbivores across feeding guilds. Exposure to elevated CO2 significantly increased the number of western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera) adults (foliage chewer) and soybean aphids (Aphis glycines; phloem feeder). No consistent effect of elevated O-3 on herbivory or insect population size was detected. Increased loss of leaf area to herbivores was associated with increased carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and leaf surface temperature. Soybean aphids are invasive pests in North America and new to this ecosystem. Higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere may increase herbivory in the soybean agroecosystem, particularly by recently introduced insect herbivores.									40	4	0	0	33	2	44			1872-8855	1872-8847		WOS:000260981200001

In an evaluation of the constraints to fish early life in high latitude ecosystems, we compared larval feeding and growth rates of an important species from the areas, the capelin (Mallotus villosus), at two latitudinal distant localities: the subarctic Kapisigdlit Fjord (64 degrees 25'N) and the arctic Disko Bay (69 degrees 15'N). In these areas, we describe oceanography by series of CTD casts and zooplankton and capelin larvae by fine-meshed nets. Zooplankton abundance and diversity were subsequently described and related to feeding and growth rates of the capelin larvae, assessed from analyses of larval gut contents and otolith ring-patterns. Early life characteristics of larvae differed markedly between the two areas. The onset of zooplankton production and the emergence of larvae took place earlier in Kapisigdlit than in the more northern Disko Bay. In Kapisiglit Fjord the dominant prey items for larvae were small calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites while large-sized calanoid nauplii dominated in the diet of Disko Bay larvae. Larval growth rates were lower in Kapisigdlit Fjord than in Disko Bay. We suggest that the later emergence of capelin larvae in Disko Bay could be compensated by enhanced feeding and thus growth rates, so that larvae from both populations would reach comparable sizes when entering the overwintering phase. However, while larval emergence and onset of plankton production are linked to different environmental cues (temperature increase vs light increase), a former match between emergence of larvae and preferred prey might be disrupted by the present temperature changes in the Arctic.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-7714	1096-0015		WOS:000535863600007

To determine whether this method provides an unbiased estimate of nestling diet, we evaluated its effect on the provisioning behavior of Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) nesting on Triangle Island, British Columbia. Adults delivering food to nestlings with bill harnesses always hesitated before entering a burrow with food, increasing their susceptibility to kleptoparasitism by gulls, and did not always leave the food intended for the nestling. These responses by adult puffins could lead to underestimates of energy intake rates of nestlings and unreliable comparisons with other species if prey left by adults in nest burrows were the only source of data. We also compared estimates of the species, number, and size of prey delivered by adult puffins as determined by direct observation from blinds to samples of prey collected directly from nest burrows and found that the two sampling techniques produced similar results. However, identifying rare prey species and gathering precise information about prey length, mass, and condition require collection of prey, and we recommend using a combination of techniques to obtain the most reliable estimates of nestling diet.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0273-8570			WOS:000240730200013

Here, we tested the effects of elevated temperatures and low dissolved oxygen levels on the survival, emerging behavior from sediment, and the respiration of juvenile cosmopolitan Manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum) by exposing them to two temperatures (20 and 23.5 degrees C) and DO levels (3.5 and 6-7mg/L). Although within previously described tolerable ranges of temperature and DO, this 3.5 degrees C increase in temperature combined with a 50% decrease in DO had a devastating effect on the survival of clams (85% mortality after 8days). The mortality of clams under normoxia at 23.5 degrees C appeared to be higher than under the low DO condition at 20 degrees C. On the other hand, more clams emerged from sediment under the low DO condition at 20 degrees C than under any other conditions. Oxygen consumption rates were not significantly affected by different conditions. Our results suggest temperature elevation combined with low oxygen additively increases stress on Manila clams and that warming is at least as stressful as low DO in terms of mortality. However, low DO poses another threat as it may induce emergence from sediment, and, thus increase predation risk. This is the first evidence that a combination of warming and deoxygenation stressors should reduce population survival of clams much more so than changes in a single stressor.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2045-7758			WOS:000434093100012	29876064

Based on unique long-term capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data (1949-2000) on pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere, United Kingdom, we provide estimates of density-dependent and density-independent effects, under the influence of individual size and sex, on natural survival, fishing mortality, and dispersal. Because survival is expected to be related to the individual growth process, we also explore the degree of parallelism between the two processes by applying the best-supported survival model structure to individual growth data. The CMR data were analyzed using sex- and age-structured multistate models (two lake basins: north and south) assuming no seasonal variation in survival and dispersal. Total survival and dispersal probabilities were insensitive to this assumption, and capture probability was shown to be robust to assumptions about intra-annual variation in survival and dispersal. The analyses revealed that large pike (> 55 cm) displayed marked basin-specific differences in survival and dispersal responses to the abundance of conspecifics in which pike from the south basin show high density dependence in survival and a low degree of density dependence in dispersal, whereas the opposite was found for those of the north basin. Both large- and small-pike dispersals were found to be dependent upon the between-basin gradient in perch (Perca fluviatilis, the main prey) abundance, but most so for north-to-south dispersal. The strength and pattern of density-dependent mortality in small pike was influenced by temperature in a peculiar way: at low summer temperatures survival was lowest at high small-pike abundances and low perch abundances; at low temperatures, survival was lowest at high small-pike abundances and high perch abundances. Analyses of individual small-pike growth trajectories showed a similar modulation of the positive perch abundance effect on growth rate when temperature increases. The growth analysis also indicated that cannibalism may be biased in favor of rapidly growing individuals or at least increased growth rate for the surviving individuals. Altogether, this study provides evidence of a complex interplay between density-dependent and density-independent factors affecting survival, dispersal, and individual growth of an aquatic top predator.									41	0	0	0	41	0	41			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000250915400001

Foraging ecology of large pelagic fishes in the US South Atlantic: structured piscivory shapes trophic niche variation								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				631				181	199		10.3354/meps13126				NOV 21 2019	2019	Sustainable management of marine fishery resources requires an understanding of the ecological relationships that contribute to community structure and population dynamics. In offshore marine ecosystems, the functional roles played by many large pelagic predators are poorly understood, yet this knowledge is essential to ecosystem-based management approaches. Here we report on the results of a multiyear (2010-2013) study to evaluate the trophic relationships within a guild of apex predatory fishes in the western Atlantic Ocean. Quantitative diet analyses were completed for wahoo Acanthocybium solandri, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, and blackfin tuna T. atlanticus during multiple seasons. Fishes were the most important prey by mass for all predators during all seasons and occurred with high frequency; however, crustacean and molluscan prey were also important dietary components for most of the predators. The diversity of prey eaten was high, with nearly 50 unique families represented; yet, a few prey groups such as scombrid fishes (Auxis spp.), flying fish (exocoetids), and ommastrephid squids, occurred more universally and dominated the diets of some predators during certain seasons. Diet similarity was highest between dolphinfish and blackfin tuna and also between wahoo and yellowfin tuna, but was generally dependent on season and driven by overlap in fish prey. Importantly, the extent of piscivory and specialization on unique fish prey groups supported a structured piscivore guild within this pelagic ecosystem, leading to separation among trophic niches and reduced overlap in prey resources. Our findings provide a temporally (seasonal and inter-annual) extensive evaluation of the trophic relationships among large pelagic fish predators in the US South Atlantic, which should inform an ecosystem-based understanding of community dynamics and fishery impacts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000521174300013		
J	Butler, Mark J.; Dolan, Thomas W., III								Potential Impacts of Everglades Restoration on Lobster and Hard Bottom Communities in the Florida Keys, FL (USA)								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				40	6			1523	1539		10.1007/s12237-017-0256-8				NOV 2017	2017	The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is intended to restore the Everglades ecosystem (FL, USA) by altering its hydrology, with likely consequences for "downstream" estuarine and marine communities in Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) are among several species of special concern with respect to CERP because they are of economic and ecological importance and because their nursery habitat may be impacted. We used agent-based, spatially explicit modeling to evaluate the possible impacts of changing water quality (temperature, salinity, harmful algal blooms (HABs)) on spiny lobsters and sponges, the latter of which provide shelter for juvenile lobsters. In our simulations, lobster abundance declined 6-24% in scenarios where salinity either decreased alone or in combination with HABs that kill sponges and are associated with changing water quality. The most severe decline in lobsters occurred when salinity was lowest and HABs occurred annually. One third of this decline was attributable to decreased salinity that increased lobster mortality and movement. However, the greatest impacts on lobsters were indirect. CERP-associated changes in salinity along with HABs caused a die-off of large sponges, resulting in higher predatory mortality on lobsters that depend on sponges for shelter in hard bottom nursery habitats. Sponges declined by similar to 50% in simulations with HABs, whereas decreased salinity alone led to sponge mortality of 9-18%. In contrast, higher temperatures increased juvenile lobster growth and eventual recruitment by approximately 7%. Our results suggest that returning Florida Bay to more estuarine, pre-development conditions is likely to result in an ecosystem reversal that is detrimental to stenohaline marine taxa, a scenario with significant socioeconomic implications.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000411505400001

Modeling food web structure and energetic control in Alaskan marine ecosystems, with implications for fishing and environmental forcing								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				138				1	17		10.1016/j.pocean.2015.09.010				NOV 2015	2015	The Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) continental shelf ecosystems show some similar and some distinctive groundfish biomass dynamics. Given that similar species occupy these regions and fisheries management is also comparable, similarities might be expected, but to what can we attribute the differences? Different types of ecosystem structure and control (e.g. top-down, bottom-up, mixed) can imply different ecosystem dynamics and climate interactions. Further, the structural type identified for a given ecosystem may suggest optimal management for sustainable fishing. Here, we use information on the current system state derived from food web models of both the EBS and the GOA combined with dynamic ecosystem models incorporating uncertainty to classify each ecosystem by its structural type. We then suggest how this structure might be generally related to dynamics and predictability. We find that the EBS and GOA have fundamentally different food web structures both overall, and when viewed from the perspective of the same commercially and ecologically important species in each system, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). EBS food web structure centers on a large mass of pollock, which appears to contribute to relative system stability and predictability. In contrast, GOA food web structure features high predator biomass, which contributes to a more dynamic, less predictable ecosystem. Mechanisms for climate influence on pollock production in the EBS are increasingly understood, while climate forcing mechanisms contributing to the potentially destabilizing high predator biomass in the GOA remain enigmatic. We present results of identical pollock fishing and climate-driven pollock recruitment simulations in the EBS and GOA which show different system responses, again with less predictable response in the GOA. Overall, our results suggest that identifying structural properties of fished food webs is as important for sustainable fisheries management as attempting to predict climate and fisheries effects within each ecosystem.

J	FARRELL, RF; GRAHAM, TE								ECOLOGICAL NOTES ON THE TURTLE CLEMMYS-INSCULPTA IN NORTHWESTERN NEW-JERSEY								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				25	1			1	9		10.2307/1564787				MAR 1991	1991	An intensive ecological study of the wood turtle, Clemmys insculpta, was conducted in northwestern New Jersey from 1978-1981. Population density averaged 10.7 turtles/ha over all years. Nearly half (45.5%) of the population consisted of adults > 140 mm in plastron length. The adult female-to-male ratio was not significantly different from 1:1. Secondary sexual differences became apparent in the ninth year, but maturity was not attained until the 14th year. While there was little difference in plastron length of adult males and females, males had longer carapaces than females of the same age. Plastral growth decreased from 84% in the first year to 2.3% in the sixth year, but showed an increase to 9.2 and 10.3% in years eight and nine. Since the ratio of abdominal scute to plastron length varied between captures, the use of abdominal scute length to estimate plastron length in Clemmys insculpta seems inappropriate. Courtship and mating occurred in the spring and fall. Females nested in June on elevated, well-drained, fully exposed sites near the stream. Clutch size averaged 8.5 and emergence of hatchlings occurred 70-71 days after nesting. Wood turtles were primarily diurnal throughout the year, but some courtship and nesting activity continued after dark. Estivation did not occur in the field; aquatic hibernation lasted from late November through early March. From May to October wood turtles assumed a solitary, terrestrial life style. Cloacal temperature was more closely correlated with substrate and water temperature than with air temperature. Comparison of temperatures among all activities showed that cloacal temperatures of turtles basking or moving on land were significantly higher than those of turtles found in water. Basking turtles accounted for 45.8% of all captures. Over the four year study period 16.8% of all turtles were found with injuries attributed primarily to raccoons (Procyon lotor). Almost 90% of all animals captured in early spring and late fall carried leeches (Placobdella parasitica).									34	0	0	0	32	0	36			0022-1511			WOS:A1991FB99200001

Rodent population cycle as a determinant of gastrointestinal nematode abundance in a low-arctic population of the red fox								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE				9				36	41		10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.03.002				AUG 2019	2019	We analyzed an 11-year time series (2005-2015) of parasite abundance for three intestinal nematode species in the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of the multi-annual rodent population cycle in low-arctic Norway, while correcting for other potential covariates that could influence prevalence and abundance. Rodents are paratenic and facultative intermediate hosts for the two Ascarididae species Toxascaris leonina and Toxocara canis, respectively and key prey for the red fox. Still the relative importance of indirect transmission through rodents and direct transmission through free-living stages is unclear. Abundance of these Ascarididae species in individual red foxes (N = 612) exhibited strongly cyclic dynamics that closely mirrored the 4-year rodent cycle. Negative binomial models provided evidence for a direct proportional increase in Ascarididae abundance with rodent density suggesting that predator functional response to rodent prey is the key transmission mechanism. In contrast, no cycles and constantly very low abundance were apparent for Uncinaria stenocephala - a third nematode species recorded without paratenic or intermediate stages.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2213-2244			WOS:000474905300006	30976515

Filtration rate (F, ml min-1) as a function of dry weight (W, g) was found to be F = 118W(total)0.68 and F = 199W(organ)0.67 for total dry weight and dry weight of organs, respectively. Ascidians starved at least 12 h had, after addition of algal cells, an initial lag-phase (1 to 2 h) with low filtration rates before constant high rates were attained. The duration of the initial lag-phase was longer at low algal cell concentrations. At algal cell concentrations above 10 to 15 x 10(3) cells ml-1, the filtration rate declined to a lower level after some time, possibly correlated with the filling of the gut. In the temperature range 4 to 21-degrees-C, maximum filtration rate (F(max), ml min-1 ind.-1) increased linearly with increasing temperature (T, degrees-C) according to F(max) = 1.46T-1.21. Above 21-degrees-C filtration rate declined rapidly with increasing temperature. The population density of C. intestinalis in the shallow cove Kertinge Nor, Fyn, Denmark, was estimated using analysis of stereophotographs. Population density varied greatly over the year with maximum densities in autumn. The filtration potential of the C intestinalis population varied during the year between 0. 1 and 1.0 times a volume equivalent to the total water volume of the cove per day. The results suggest that the population of C. intestinalis in Kertinge Nor may have an important grazing impact on the phytoplankton in late summer-early fall.									136	2	0	0	133	0	141			0171-8630			WOS:A1992KC64000002		
J	Marshall, Kristin N.; Cooper, David J.; Hobbs, N. Thompson				Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016				Interactions among herbivory, climate, topography and plant age shape riparian willow dynamics in northern Yellowstone National Park, USA								JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				102	3			667	677		10.1111/1365-2745.12225				MAY 2014	2014	Understanding how the environmental context modifies the strength of trophic interactions within food webs forms a central challenge in community ecology.Here, we demonstrate the necessity of considering the influence of climate, landscape heterogeneity and demographics for understanding trophic interactions in a well-studied food web in Yellowstone National Park, USA. We studied riparian willow (Salix spp.) establishment and stem growth reconstructed from tree rings on the northern range of Yellowstone over a 30-year period that included the reintroduction of a top predator, the grey wolf (Canis lupus).We used climate variables (annual precipitation, stream flow and growing season length), herbivore abundance and landscape descriptors (elevation and topographic wetness index) to predict establishment and growth processes through time before and after the reintroduction of wolves. We fitted Bayesian hierarchical models to establishment data and time series of individual stem heights from 1980 to 2008.Explaining variability in establishment required models with stream flow, annual precipitation and elk abundance.Climate, trophic and landscape covariates interacted with stem age to determine stem height and growth rate through time. Growth rates of most stems ages (2+) declined after the reintroduction of wolves. However, stem growth rates naturally declined with age, and the decline we observed was coincident with faster growth rates for the youngest stems. Mean stem heights at age have remained relatively stable through time for most age classes. Estimated effects of landscape topography had approximately the same magnitude of effect on stem growth rate at age as elk abundance.Synthesis. We show that the effects of modification of a food web cannot be predicted by studying trophic dynamics in isolation. No single driver explained patterns of willow establishment and growth over the past three decades in Yellowstone. Instead, interactions among trophic forces, interannual climate variability and landscape topography together shaped how the ecosystem responded to perturbations. Top-down effects of ungulates on riparian woody vegetation must be considered in the context of plant age, and climate and landscape heterogeneity.									24	0	1	0	22	0	25			0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000334588300013

Benefits and costs of Leptophlebia (Ephemeroptera) mayfly movements between river channels and floodplain wetlands								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE				89	8			714	723		10.1139/Z11-044				AUG 2011	2011	Dramatic drift of nymphs of the mayflies Leptophlebia Westwood, 1840 and Siphlonurus Eaton, 1868 (47 600 individuals/trap per hour) was observed between a southeastern USA river and adjacent floodplain following natural flooding events. Active movements of these nymphs against the water flow were also detected. Large numbers of leptophlebid nymphs reside in floodplains during the winter and spring, but how and why they colonize and develop in temporary habitats is uncertain. We detected few environmental advantages (i.e., temperature, food abundance or quality) for mayflies in floodplains compared with river habitats. Despite this, experiments indicated that mayflies had 36% higher growth rates in the floodplain than in the river and demonstrated tolerance to short-term drying (up to 12 d). Migration entails costs of migrating against flows during daylight when vulnerability to predation is high, colonizing a habitat subject to drying, hypoxia, and supporting amphibian predators, with few apparent benefits. Dispersal into wetlands may be attributed to avoiding swift river flows or exploiting largely fishless habitats. However, dispersal could be an evolutionary relic of behavior beneficial in more northerly habitats; our study populations of Leptophlebia mayflies were at the southern extreme of their range and perhaps operating suboptimally. Our results emphasize the importance of river floodplain linkages to the ecology of both habitats.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0008-4301			WOS:000295390200007

Fisheries can affect non-target species through bycatch, and climate change may act simultaneously on their population dynamics. Estimating the relative impact of fisheries and climate on non-target species remains a challenge for many populations because the spatio-temporal distribution of individuals remains poorly known and available demographic information is incomplete.2. We used population survey data, capture-mark-recapture methods, population modelling and the demographic invariant method to investigate the effects of climate and fisheries on the demography of a predator species affected by bycatch. These complementary approaches were used to help account for different sources of uncertainty.3. The white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis is the commonest seabird species killed by longline fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Petrel breeding success was positively related to the fishing effort for Patagonian toothfish Dissosticus eleginoides. El Nino, events negatively affected adult survival with a time lag of 3 years. Fishing efforts for toothfish and hake (Merluccius spp.) were negatively related to petrel recruitment, suggesting that fisheries-induced mortality strongly impacted younger age classes. Lambda estimated from matrix population models was below replacement (0.964 +/- 0.026), and the number of breeding pairs declined by approximate to 37% in 21 years. This decline was probably caused by low survival of both young age classes and adults.4. The Crozet archipelago, Southern Indian Ocean, population size was estimated at 170 000 individuals in the early 1980s, and would be severely affected by any additional source of mortality that approached 8000 individuals per year. The number of petrels killed by the toothfish fishery alone exceeded this threshold during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but has declined well below this since 2003.5. Synthesis and applications. Complementary approaches suggest that both longline fishery bycatch and climate have a significant impact on the size of the Southern Ocean white-chinned petrel population. Stopping or reversing climate change will be a very slow process, and may be impossible. Therefore,we recommend a reduction in bycatch to help the populations recover. Further information on the status of individuals caught in longlines is required to understand the demographic processes involved.									45	0	0	0	44	0	47			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000259788100018		
J	Bell, David M.; Clark, James S.					Bell, David/0000-0002-2673-5836			Seed predation and climate impacts on reproductive variation in temperate forests of the southeastern USA								OECOLOGIA				180	4			1223	1234		10.1007/s00442-015-3537-6				APR 2016	2016	Climatic effects on tree recruitment will be determined by the interactive effects of fecundity and seed predation. Evaluating how insect and vertebrate seed predators mediate tree reproductive responses to climate depends on long-term studies of seed production, development, and predation. In this study, our objectives were to (1) assess the effects of interannual climate variation on seed abortion rates, (2) assess the impact of seed density on predation rates, and (3) examine the degree to which density-dependent seed predation would amplify or dampen interannual variation in fecundity associated with seed abortion. We used a 19-year study of seed abortion and pre-dispersal predation rates by insects and vertebrates (birds and rodents) for five temperate tree species across forest plots from the North Carolina Piedmont to the Southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern USA. We found that rates of seed abortion and predation increased reproductive variation for oaks (Quercus species). Probabilitey of seed abortion was greatest during years with cool, dry springs. Responses of seed predation on Quercus species to current year's seed density varid by species, but exhibited positive density-dependence to previous year's seed density consistent with numerical responses of seed predators. Seed abortion and predation rates for two drupe species responded little to variation in climate or seed density, respectively. Given that predation increased interannual variation in seed availability and the negative density-dependence to previous year's seed density, our results indicate that consistent numerical responses of oak seed predators may amplify interannual variation due to climate-mediated processes like seed abortion.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000373186100029	26747267

When eggs and larvae were reared at 20 degrees, 24 degrees and 28 degrees C, the developmental periods were shorter at higher temperatures, but developmental delay was seen at 30 degrees C. The developmental zeros of eggs and larvae were 13.3 degrees and 13.5 degrees C, respectively. The effective accumulative temperature from egg to adult was 321.1 degree-days and the survival rate was the greatest at 24 degrees C. No significant difference was seen in the consumed number of prey at the above temperatures. The larval mortality at 0.5, 1, 3 and 8 prey per day was inversely related to prey density, decreasing as density increased. The total number of consumed prey increased at high prey density.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			0021-4914			WOS:A1995RR96400009

The Sargasso Sea spawning area of the Atlantic catadromous freshwater eels has a regular pattern of shallow autumn to spring temperature fronts. There is limited information about the southern Sargasso Sea GZ fauna, and it is not known which species are distributed across these frontal zones. Plankton samples from a survey of larval European eel (Anguilla anguilla) abundance in March and April 2017 using an Isaacs-Kidd Midwater Trawl (0-300 m, 35 stations, three transects) were used to examine the distribution and abundance of net-captured CS and other GZ species in relation to oceanographic characteristics. More than 2200 specimens of 15 taxa were sub-sampled, with five CS (Abylopsis tetragona, A. eschscholtzii, Chelophyes appendiculata, Eudoxoides spiralis and E. mitra) dominating catches at every station. GZ were most abundant around the 22 and 24 degrees C isotherms, and higher abundances of CS in the north were correlated with lower water temperature. The widespread presence of CS across the European eel spawning area is consistent with a recent study detecting their DNA sequences in the gut contents of young eel larvae collected in the Sargasso Sea, suggesting CS material was either eaten directly or as part of ingested marine snow particles. The present study shows that both types of organisms occupy the southern Sargasso Sea during the European eel spawning season.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1867-1616	1867-1624		WOS:000496938500020

Hatchery-reared (n=40) and wild pre-smolts (n=40) were tagged with acoustic tags, and an array of receivers along the migration route was deployed. In all, 77 and 85% of the fish from the two groups, respectively, were recorded as migrating smolts, that is, predation rate and/or numbers of fish opting to remain in the river were low. Hatchery-reared smolts showed a migration pattern, speed and migration route similar to wild smolts, even though the time period between river release and onset of migration was relatively short. Both groups of smolt showed high migration speed through both the river and the fjord compared with other studies.									20	0	0	0	19	0	20			0969-997X	1365-2400		WOS:000330129700009

The growth-mortality hypothesis has received broad acceptance as a driver of recruitment variability, with cohorts comprised of fast-growing large-at-age larvae having high larval survival and subsequent juvenile recruitment. Long-term monitoring in Port Phillip Bay, Australia, suggests that snapper Chrysophrys auratus (Sparidae) experience high variation in juvenile recruitment, which is closely related to variation in larval abundance. Using a 6 yr data set of snapper larval abundance, we assessed whether growth rate-dependent effects on larval survival were a driver of recruitment variation. Mean daily growth rates, estimated from otolith daily rings, were positively correlated with larval abundances, with higher abundance in 3 of the 6 years characterised by both higher larval growth rates and increased 0-age survival. Daily growth trajectories diverged among higher and lower abundance years early in development. Increased availability of copepod nauplii prey and higher temperatures best explained the interannual variation in larval growth. Fast growth in years of higher larval abundance, and a link between prey production, temperature and fast larval growth, support the importance of the larval stage to recruitment dynamics of marine fish populations.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000322577400013

We analyzed data from 36 lakes providing 134 lake years (annual means) of data. These lakes represent clear, organically stained, and glacially turbid lake types, They produce age-1 sockeye salmon smelts exhibiting a threefold variation in average length (52-145 mm) and a 30-fold variation in average weight (1-30 g). We used simple regression analysis to test for linkages between age-1 smolt size and the independent variables zooplankton biomass (mg/m(2)), smolt density (number/km(2)), length of the growing season, and mean water column temperature. Zooplankton biomass (ZB) was the strongest single predictor of smolt size, accounting for 52% of the variation in mean age-1 smolt fork length (FL) and weight (W). Individually, smolt density (SMD) accounted for only 10% of the variance in age-1 smolt size: however, mean water column temperature (T(s)) explained 24% of the variation in FL and 19% of the variation in W. Smolt size was unrelated to the length of the growing season (S); however, growth rate indexed by length varied inversely with S while growth in terms of weight did not. Subsequently, we combined all factors into a multivariate model of age-1 smolt size and the population's biological and thermal environment. Taken together. the factors ZB, SMD, and T(s) accounted for 70% of the variation in FL and W. The influence of temperature on smolt size appeared to be more direct (through its effect on metabolic rates) than indirect (through limiting food availability [plankton]), Our results may influence fishery management objectives and serve as a template to project future trends in juvenile sockeye salmon growth under different climatic conditions.									32	0	0	0	35	0	36			0002-8487			WOS:000169852700010		
J	PURCELL, JE				Purcell, Jennifer E/E-9991-2011				EFFECTS OF PREDATION BY THE SCYPHOMEDUSAN CHRYSAORA-QUINQUECIRRHA ON ZOOPLANKTON POPULATIONS IN CHESAPEAKE BAY, USA								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				87	1-2			65	76		10.3354/meps087065				OCT 1992	1992	The diet, digestion times, and densities of Chrysaora quinquerirrha medusae, and densities of their prey were quantified in order to evaluate the importance of this conspicuous scyphomedusan on zooplankton populations in Chesapeake Bay, USA, and its tributaries. Medusae consumed a variety of zooplankton prey, but copepods, mostly Acartia tonsa, averaged 55 % of the prey items in gut contents collected during July and August from 2 tributaries of Chesapeake Bay in 1987 and 1988, and 71 % of the prey in gut contents from the main bay in 1987-1990. Medusae showed positive selection for copepods, but negative selection for copepod nauplii. Digestion times of copepods by medusae averaged 3.5 h. A multiple regression equation related digestion times to temperature and the number of ingested copepods, but not to medusa size. Predation rates (numbers of copepods consumed medusa-1 d-1) increased with increasing prey density, medusa diameter, and temperature. These results provide a means of predicting C. quinquecirrha feeding in situ. Greater numbers of prey in medusae at nighttime than during the day probably were due to greater prey densities at night. Daily predation effects (percentage of the copepod standing stock consumed d-1) were calculated from feeding rates, and the densities of medusae and copepods. Medusa densities (peaks of 11 to 16 m-3) and predation effects (peaks of 42 to 94 % d-1 of the copepods consumed) were much greater in the 2 tributaries than at a nearshore station in the bay (peaks of 2 medusae m-3 and 3 % d-1 of the copepods consumed). Ingestion of zooplankton provided an average of 145 % of the nitrogen needed to balance excretion in medusae <45 mm in diameter, but supplied only 65 % of the nitrogen needs of medusae >45 mm. Other prey, including ctenophores, fish eggs and larvae, and large polychaete worms are additional contributions to the diet. Predation by C. quinquecirrha medusae may control copepod populations in some tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, as suggested by high predation effects and declining copepod populations throughout the summer.									149	3	1	0	121	3	154			0171-8630			WOS:A1992JX65500007

Diel vertical migrations (DVM) are frequently observed in pelagic fish and zooplankton populations. In addition to predator avoidance and foraging opportunity, bioenergetics optimisation has been hypothesised to cause the selective advantage of migrating fish. However, experimental confirmation of growth advantages of fish held at naturally observed cyclic temperatures, and food densities are surprisingly rare.2. We compared growth rates, growth efficiencies and energy budgets of vendace (Coregonus albula, Salmoniformes) fed daily rations of 10% body mass and held at low (4.5 degrees C), high (8 degrees C) and cyclic (switch between 4.5 and 8 degrees C) temperatures over a period of 6 weeks. Biochemical body composition was evaluated by bioimpedance analyses and direct determination of water, lipid and protein content in a subset of fish.3. Growth rate and food conversion efficiency were similar in fish held at high and cyclic temperatures, but higher than those found at low temperatures. Body condition of fish at cyclic temperatures was maximised, but these fish also had the highest water content. The proportion of lipids and proteins was slightly depleted in fish held at cyclic and low temperatures relative to the high temperature treatment. Accordingly, growth and biochemical composition of fish responded specifically to cyclic temperatures and were not simply intermediate between those found at low and high temperatures.4. We could not confirm a bioenergetics advantage of fish switching between high and low temperatures. However, there were no substantial extra metabolic costs through exposure to cyclic temperatures, and hence, fish performing DVM may benefit from predation avoidance without compromising their metabolic balance and hence growth rates. These results suggest that the evolution of DVM is a multi-faceted process with no single ultimate explanation.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000292446700008		
J	Shrader, TM; Weldon, M								Growth dynamics of smallmouth bass in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon								NORTHWEST SCIENCE				78	3			250	260						SUM 2004	2004	During May-October, 200 1, we analyzed the growth patterns and diet overlap of different ages of smallmouth bass in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon to identify periods within the growing season when temperature or competition for food might limit growth. Bass of various ages were sampled during three 6-wk periods with a boat-mounted electroshocker from nearshore sites in two separate habitat types. Age 0 bass consumed smaller prey items, while older and larger fish were able to consume an increasingly wider size range of prey, predominantly crayfish. Bass consumed fewer crayfish through the study. Age I smallmouth bass consumed only age 0 crayfish, while older bass were not as limited. Diets of age 3 and age 4 smallmouth bass were similar with crayfish constituting at least 70% of the diets by volume, although amphipods and other invertebrates were important prey items to individual fish. During all periods of the study, realized consumption, defined as actual consumption divided by theoretical metabolic maximum consumption and indexed by the P-value generated from bioenergetic modeling, was generally higher for smaller fish than for larger bass. Consumption rates for juvenile and adult bass dropped dramatically in the fall demonstrating potential food limitation during this period. Our study suggests that during the fall, high densities of age 0 bass may affect the availability of alternative prey (chironomids and amphipods) and consequently, the growth of older age classes of smallmouth bass.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0029-344X			WOS:000224512100009

This is especially true in the Arctic tundra where, despite relatively simple food webs, it is still unclear which forces dominate in this ecosystem. Our primary goal was to assess the extent to which a tundra food web was dominated by plant-herbivore or predator-prey interactions. Based on a 17-year (1993-2009) study of terrestrial wildlife on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, we developed trophic mass balance models to address this question. Snow Geese were the dominant herbivores in this ecosystem, followed by two sympatric lemming species (brown and collared lemmings). Arctic foxes, weasels, and several species of birds of prey were the dominant predators. Results of our trophic models encompassing 19 functional groups showed that <10% of the annual primary production was consumed by herbivores in most years despite the presence of a large Snow Goose colony, but that 20-100% of the annual herbivore production was consumed by predators. The impact of herbivores on vegetation has also weakened over time, probably due to an increase in primary production. The impact of predators was highest on lemmings, intermediate on passerines, and lowest on geese and shorebirds, but it varied with lemming abundance. Predation of collared lemmings exceeded production in most years and may explain why this species remained at low density. In contrast, the predation rate on brown lemmings varied with prey density and may have contributed to the high-amplitude, periodic fluctuations in the abundance of this species. Our analysis provided little evidence that herbivores are limited by primary production on Bylot Island. In contrast, we measured strong predator-prey interactions, which supports the hypothesis that this food web is primarily controlled by top-down forces. The presence of allochthonous resources subsidizing top predators and the absence of large herbivores may partly explain the predominant role of predation in this low-productivity ecosystem.									61	1	0	0	52	0	63			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000306829300021	22919916

A temperature experiment with P. fluviatilis and R. rutilus in aquaria (with either one P. fluviatilis or two R. rutilus) was tested at five temperatures: 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 degrees C, and showed that P. fluviatilis had a lower swimming speed and capture rate than R. rutilus, especially at 4 and 8 degrees C. The effect of group size was tested at four R. rutilus abundances: 0, 2, 4 and 6, all at 16 degrees C, and revealed that swimming speed and capture rate of P. fluviatilis were lowest at the highest R. rutilus abundance, whereas R. rutilus was relatively unaffected. Perca fluviatilis occupied positions closer to the bottom than R. rutilus, especially when feeding, and this tendency was reinforced at the highest roach abundance.									9	0	0	0	9	0	10			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000275466200009

To investigate possible impacts, juvenile paua (similar to 24 mm shell length) were grown for 4 months in seawater pH/pCO(2) conditions projected for 2100. End of century seawater projections (pH(T) 7.66/pCO(2) similar to 1,000 mu atm) were contrasted with local ambient lconditions (pH(T) 8.00/pCO(2) similar to 400 mu atm) at two typical temperatures (13 and 15 degrees C). We used a combination of methods (morphometric, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction) to investigate effects on juvenile survival and growth, as well as shell mineralogy and integrity. Lowered pH did not affect survival, growth rate or condition, but animals grew significantly faster at the higher temperature. Juvenile paua were able to biomineralise their inner nacreous aragonite layer and their outer prismatic calcite layer under end-of-century pH conditions, at both temperatures, and carbonate composition was not affected. There was some thickening of the nacre layer in the newly deposited shell with reduced pH and also at the higher temperature. Most obvious was post-depositional alteration of the shell under lowered pH: the prismatic calcite layer was thinner, and there was greater etching of the external shell surface; this dissolution was greater at the higher temperature. These results demonstrate the importance of even a small (2 degrees C) difference in temperature on growth and shell characteristics, and on modifying the effects at lowered pH. Projected CO2-related changes may affect shell quality of this iconic New Zealand mollusc through etching (dissolution) and thinning, with potential implications for resilience to physical stresses such as predation and wave action.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000487581500005	31579589

In June 2009, a desert locust swarm invaded the Guassa Plateau, Ethiopia, a large and unusually intact Afroalpine tall-grass ecosystem, home to important populations of geladas (Theropithecus gelada), Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis), thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), and other Ethiopian or Horn of Africa endemics. During the outbreak and its aftermath, we observed many animals, including geladas, ravens, and a wolf, feeding on locusts in large quantities. These observations suggest surprising flexibility in the normally highly specialized diets of geladas and wolves, including the potential for temporary but intensive insectivory during locust outbreaks. To our knowledge, Guassa is the highest elevation site (3,200-3,600 m) at which desert locusts, which require temperatures >20 degrees C for sustained flight, have been reported. Continued monitoring will be necessary to determine whether the June 2009 outbreak was an isolated incident or part of an emerging pattern in the Ethiopian Highlands linked to global warming. The intensive consumption of desert locusts by geladas, wolves, and ravens during the outbreak at Guassa raises concerns about pesticide-based locust control strategies and potential unintended adverse effects on endemic and endangered wildlife.									22	0	0	0	17	0	22			0032-8332	1610-7365		WOS:000282082200001	20333438

HYDROBIOLOGIA				387				349	353		10.1023/A:1017043222783				1998	1998	The numerical response of populations to different food concentrations in an important parameter to be determined for a mechanistic approach to interspecific competition. Theory predicts that the species with the lowest food level (TFL) should always be the superior competitor if only one food source is offered. However, TFLs are not species specific constants but may change along environmental gradients such as food size or temperature.The hypothesis that temperature differentially affects the TFLs of three planktonic rotifers (Asplanchna priodonta, Brachionus calyciflorus and Synchaeta pectinata) was tested in laboratory experiments. Numerical responses were assessed for all three rotifers at 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 degrees C with Cryptomonas erosa as food alga. Growth rates of all three rotifers at high food concentrations (1 mg C l(-1)) increased as temperature increased until the limits of thermal tolerance were reached. This increase was very pronounced for Brachionus, but less for Synchaeta which already had relatively high growth rates at 12 degrees C. Along the temperature gradient, the TFLs of Synchaeta increased from 0.074 to 0.66 mg C l(-1), whereas those of Asplanchna and Brachionus stayed relatively constant at 0.3 and 0.2 mg C l(-1), respectively. Hence, the zero net growth isocline (ZNGI) of Synchaeta crossed those of Brachionus and Asplanchna at 16 and 20.5 degrees C, respectively. The results suggest that Synchaeta is better adapted to low temperatures than the other two rotifers and should be the superior competitor below 16 degrees C.

Organisms regularly interact with other species, yet whether climate-mediated evolution can occur in the context of species interactions is not well understood. We tested whether a species interaction could modify evolutionary responses to temperature. We demonstrate that predation pressure by Dipteran larvae (Chaoborus americanus) modified the evolutionary response of a freshwater crustacean (Daphnia pulex) to its thermal environment over approximately seven generations in laboratory conditions. Daphnia kept at 21 degrees C evolved higher population growth rates than those kept at 18 degrees C, but only in those populations that were also reared with predators. Furthermore, predator-mediated selection resulted in the evolution of elevated Daphnia thermal plasticity. This laboratory natural selection experiment demonstrates that biotic interactions can modify evolutionary adaptation to temperature. Understanding the interplay between multiple selective forces can improve predictions of ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to rapid environmental change.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000367482000009	26673935

Along with development of habitat choice mechanisms, there has been a major push to develop and apply to fish populations individual-based models that incorporate various forms of these mechanisms. However, it is not known how the wide variation in observed and hypothesized mechanisms of fish habitat choice could alter fish population predictions (e.g. growth, size distributions, etc.). We used spatially explicit, individual-based modeling to compare predicted fish populations using different submodels of patch choice behavior under various food and temperature distributions. We compared predicted growth, temperature experience, food consumption, and final spatial distribution using the different models. Our results demonstrated that the habitat choice mechanism assumed in fish population modeling simulations was critical to predictions of fish distribution and growth rates. Hence, resource managers who use modeling results to predict fish population trends should be very aware of and understand the underlying patch choice mechanisms used in their models to assure that those mechanisms correctly represent the fish populations being modeled.

Understanding of the mechanisms linking environment to recruitment is essential for the effective management of fisheries resources. In this study, we used a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model to study the effect of climate variability on sardine recruitment in the California Current System during 1965-2006. Ocean variability was represented by ROMS hydrodynamic and NEMURO biogeochemical models, and sardine population dynamics was simulated through a full life cycle individual-based model. Model analysis was designed to elucidate how changes in abiotic and biotic conditions may impact the spawning habitats, early life stage survival, and ultimately recruitment of sardine. Our findings revealed the importance of spatial processes to shape early life stages dynamics. Shifts in spawning habitats were dictated by the spatial variations in temperature and the behavioral movement of adults. Additionally, the spatial match of eggs with warmer temperatures and larvae with their prey influenced their survival. The northward shifts in spawning locations and the accomplishment of good recruitment in warmer years agreed with existing knowledge. Egg production and survival during egg and yolk-sac larval stages were key factors to drive the long-term variations in recruitment. Finally, our analysis provided a quantitative assessment of climate impact on year-to-year variation in sardine recruitment by integrating multiple hypotheses.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000446561000009

Due to their particular life history traits, long-lived migrants are amongst the most endangered and sensitive group of animals to these harming effects. Our ability to identify and quantify such anthropogenic threats in both breeding and wintering grounds is, therefore, of key importance in the field of conservation biology. Using long-term capture-recapture data (34 years, 4557 individuals) and year-round tracking data (4 years, 100 individuals) of a trans-equatorial migrant, the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), we investigated the impact of longline fisheries and climatic variables in both breeding and wintering areas on the most important demographic trait of this seabird, i.e. adult survival. Annual adult survival probability was estimated at 0.914+/-0.022 on average, declining throughout 1978-1999 but recovering during the last decade (2005-2011). Our results suggest that both the incidental bycatch associated with longline fisheries and high sea surface temperatures (indirectly linked to food availability; SST) increased mortality rates during the long breeding season (March-October). Shearwater survival was also negatively affected during the short non-breeding season (December-February) by positive episodes of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Indirect negative effects of climate at both breeding (SST) and wintering grounds (SOI) had a greater impact on survival than longliner activity, and indeed these climatic factors are those which are expected to present more unfavourable trends in the future. Our work underlines the importance of considering both breeding and wintering habitats as well as precise schedules/phenology when assessing the global role of the local impacts on the dynamics of migratory species.									22	0	0	0	21	0	22			1932-6203			WOS:000306466100075	22815833

In the end of April, all ponds were stocked by free-swimming perch larvae (120,000 ind ha(-1)). In June, topmouth gudgeon was introduced as forage fish (40 kg ha(-1)) into two of the experimental ponds. Topmouth gudgeon significantly influenced neither the total abundance of zooplankton nor the abundance of its groups (Rotifera, Cladocera, Copepoda). The most important food item for perch (TL > 29 mm) was macroinvertebrates (especially Chironomidae). In the ponds with topmouth gudgeon, copepods and cladocerans were more important than in ponds without it. Specific growth rate of perch was 0.01 mm day(-1) in all ponds. Final mean total length (TL +/- A SD) of perch was 73 +/- A 13 and 70 +/- A 6 mm in the ponds with topmouth gudgeon and without it, respectively. Only 1 % of the perch reached higher TL than that recorded in the ponds without the topmouth gudgeon. Survival rate of perch varied from 12 to 36 % depending on ponds. Piscivory was recorded in all ponds from the age of 57 days (post-stocking); however, perch siblings were preferred to topmouth gudgeon. The highest asymptotic growth (La = 88 mm) was calculated in the pond stocked with topmouth gudgeon. This corresponded with the highest cannibalism and lowest survival rate (12 %). Perch growth rate increased till 42-53 days of perch age and then started to decrease. There was no significant influence of potential prey fish (topmouth gudgeon) on the growth of 0+ perch; however, two size cohorts were found in the ponds with the topmouth gudgeon. Presence or absence of littoral macrophytes seems to be more substantial for rearing perch in ponds than stocking with the prey fish.

An application of the method reveals how interplay between temperature and plankton dynamics during 1970-2009 impacted a cold-water species (Atlantic cod Gadus morhua) and a warm-water species (European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) in the North Sea. Larval fish growth rates were estimated by coupling models depicting traitbased foraging and bioenergetics of individuals, spatiotemporal changes in their prey field, and the biogeochemistry and hydrodynamics of the region. The biomass composition of modeled prey fields varied from 89% nano-, 10% micro-, and 1% mesoplankton to 15% nano-, 20% micro-, and 65% mesoplankton. The mean slope of the normalized biomass size spectrum was near -1.2, consistent with theoretical and empirical estimates. Median larval fish growth rates peaked in June for cod (24% d(-1)) and in July for anchovy (17% d(-1)). Insufficient prey resources played a substantial role in limiting the growth rates of cod larvae. Anchovy were consistently limited by cold temperatures. Faster median larval growth during specific months was significantly (p < 0.05) positively associated with detrended (i.e. higher than expected) juvenile recruitment indices in cod (rank correlation Kendall's tau = 22%) and anchovy (tau = 42%). For cod, the most predictive month was February, which was also when food limitation was most prevalent. The continued development of modeling tools based on first principles can help further a mechanistic understanding of how changes in the environment affect the productivity of living marine resources.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000441331700009

Moreover, in situ punctual clearance experiments were conducted seasonally searching for possible relationships between food uptake and sponge dynamics, The monthly growth rates (GR) of C. candelabrum were low (0.19 +/- 0.02 mean [+/- SE] for the 3 yr of study), variable and seasonal, with the highest values in summer. The cumulative survival function followed a stepped profile with several consecutive months without mortality separated by shorter mortality events, which mainly occurred in cold months (winter-spring). However, an event of high mortality (76 % of the monitored individuals died) took place in the particularly warm summer 2003. Fission events were frequent after previous damage (e.g. partial predation) and only one fusion event was recorded along the study period. The diet of C. candelabrum was highly heterogeneous. Differences in clearance rates (CR) among picoplankton types with season indicated that the sponge retained with different efficiency the several picoplankton types present in the water. Survival and GRs were significantly different for small, medium and large individuals (size-classes I, II and III), with the small sponges showing the lowest survival (56.6% cumulative mortality for the last 2 yr of study) and the highest GRs (0.18 +/- 0.03 mo(-1), mean +/- SE). On the whole, the results indicate that C. candelabrum is a slow-growing but dynamic sponge.									27	0	0	0	25	0	27			0171-8630			WOS:000257050600009		
J	Klokocovnik, Vesna; Hauptman, Gregor; Devetak, Dusan				Klokocovnik, Vesna/Q-5123-2019				Effect of substrate temperature on behavioural plasticity in antlion larvae								BEHAVIOUR				153	1			31	48		10.1163/1568539X-00003322				2016	2016	Temperature is of crucial importance, affecting all aspects of insect life such as survival, development and daily activity patterns, and consequently behaviour. In the present study we evaluated the effect of temperature on the behavioural plasticity of antlion larvae, the sit-and-wait predators, which are considerably more dependent on local habitat conditions. We provided ethological descriptions of pit construction and feeding behaviour. An increase in temperature led to greater activity and consequently to greater frequency of sand tossing during pit construction. Larvae constructed bigger pits at higher temperatures, but required less time than at lower temperatures, when the resulting pits were the smallest. At low temperature, larvae required more time for feeding, and behaviour followed a core pattern with little variety, in comparison to behaviour at high temperatures. Two behavioural patterns occurred only at the highest temperature: 'relocation' and 'submergence', presumably in response to high temperatures.									7	0	0	0	8	0	8			0005-7959	1568-539X		WOS:000365978700003

These aquatic snakes display extreme sexual dimorphism, with body sizes and relative head sizes of females much larger than those of males. Two consecutive years with low rainfall during the late wet season reduced the abundance of small but not large sized fish. Although snake residual body mass (RBM, calculated from a general linear regression of ln-transformed mass to ln-SVL) decreased after the first year with low prey availability, it was not until the second year that reduced prey abundance caused a dramatic decline in filesnake survival, and hence in population numbers. Thus, our results suggest that most snakes survived the first year of reduced prey abundance, but a successive year with low prey availability proved fatal for many animals. However, the effects of prey scarcity on RBM and survival fell disproportionately on some size classes of snakes. Medium-sized animals (large males and intermediate-sized females) were affected more dramatically than were small or large snakes. We attribute the higher survival of small snakes to their lower energy needs compared to medium-sized individuals, and the higher survival of large snakes to the continued abundance of large prey (mainly large catfish). Two successive years with low abundance of smaller sized prey thus massively modified the size-structure of the filesnake population, virtually eliminating large males and intermediate-sized females. Our field data provide a clear demonstration of the ways in which stochastic variation in climatic conditions can have dramatic effects on predator population demography, mediated via effects on prey availability.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000273069000021

Hence, exposure to similar environments should translate into synchrony in vital rates. Despite a wide-ranging breeding population, the Baltic/Wadden Sea flyway population of eiders (Somateria m. mollissima) shares wintering grounds in the southern Baltic Sea, inner Danish waters and the Wadden Sea; different colonies within this flyway population are therefore likely to exhibit some degree of synchrony in vital rates. Here we used capture-recapture-recovery data to investigate the impact of hunting, winter climate (the North-Atlantic Oscillation Index), winter temperature, nitrogen runoff, autumn-winter body condition of blue mussels Mytilus spp., natural predation and epidemic disease (avian cholera) on annual survival of adult females in ten study colonies distributed between Netherlands and Finland. Moreover, we tested how the degree of similarity in spatial winter distributions affected the degree of similarity in annual survival among colonies. None of the covariates universally affected female survival. While the quality of blue mussels in the wintering area explained almost 40% of the variation in survival of eiders breeding on Christianso in the south-western Baltic Sea, incidence of epidemic disease explained >60% in two affected colonies. Furthermore, the spatial winter distribution did not appreciably influence annual survival rates in these 10 colonies. The lack of universal effects of spatial winter distribution and winter conditions on survival suggests that local breeding conditions may be more important, and hence prime targets for conservation efforts. Better monitoring of e.g., food quality, predation pressure and epidemic disease at the time of breeding could be the key to better understand the population dynamics in this endangered flyway population.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-701X			WOS:000584716000001

Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hut-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature: occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding an invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the "hydrologic landscape." The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.									40	0	0	0	38	0	40			0012-9658			WOS:000086351500015

Until recently, the role of avian predation in limiting recovery of coho salmon and steelhead in central California coastal watersheds has been overlooked. We used recoveries of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from Ano Nuevo Island (ANI), a breeding site for several species of piscivorous seabirds, to estimate predation rates on juvenile salmonids and identify susceptible life stages and species responsible for predation. A total of 34,485 PIT tags were deployed in coho salmon and steelhead in six watersheds in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. Tags were deposited on ANI by predators after ingestion of tagged fish. Because tags were not removed from the island and were detected on multiple sampling occasions, we were able to use markrecapture models to generate a corrected minimum predation estimate. We used POPAN, a variation of the JollySeber model, to generate an estimate of gross population abundance, which accounted for tags deposited on the island but not detected during surveys. Detections of 196 tags from surveys conducted between autumn 2006 and spring 2009 were incorporated into the model, producing a gross population estimate of 242 tags (SE = 9.8). Addition of tags detected between autumn 2009 and 2010 to the abundance estimate from POPAN produced a new minimum estimate of 362 tags on ANI. Western gulls Larus occidentalis probably were the primary predator depositing tags on ANI. Minimum predation estimates ranged from 0.1% (Soquel Creek) to 4.6% (Waddell Creek) of outmigrating coho salmon and steelhead smolts. Predation was potentially greater given still unquantified deposition of tags off-colony and destruction of tags during digestive processes of predators. Finally, avian predators targeted estuary-reared fish, which contributed disproportionately to adult populations, further impacting imperiled salmon populations.

Such behavioral responses are poorly understood for most ectothermic species, including anuran amphibians. We quantified effects of simulated infection (via injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) on feeding, activity, and thermoregulation of cane toads Bufo marinus within their invasive range in tropical Australia. LPS injection reduced feeding rates in laboratory trials. For toads in outdoor enclosures, LPS injection reduced activity and shifted body temperature profiles. Although previous research has attributed such thermal shifts to behavioral fever (elevated body temperatures may help fight infection), our laboratory studies suggest instead that LPS-injected toads stopped moving. In a thermal gradient, LPS-injected toads thus stayed close to whichever end of the gradient (hot or cold) they were first introduced; the introduction site (rather than behavioral thermoregulation) thus determined body temperature regimes. Shifts in thermal profiles of LPS-injected toads in outdoor enclosures also were a secondary consequence of inactivity. Thus, the primary behavioral effects of an immune response in cane toads are reduced rates of activity and feeding. Thermoregulatory modifications also occur but only as a secondary consequence of inactivity.									28	0	0	0	27	0	28			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000286421300007	21128787

Daphnia lumholtzi, not previously reported in North America, was found in a small reservoir in East Texas in January, 1991. This species possesses extremely long spines and large fornices; an allometric study was performed to detect any temporal differences in specific growth rates of the spines relative to the body.2. In nature, mature females attained 1.8 mm body length, excluding spines, but when the head and tail spines are included, the total length reached a maximum of 5.6 mm.3. Differences in the growth patterns of the head spine and the tail spine relative to the body existed for D. lumholtzi from January to March 1991. Both the head and the tail spines grew at a faster rate than the body during all 3 months although the rates varied between them. The results contradict the invertebrate predation hypothesis (Dodson, 1974) in that D. lumholtzi's head and tail spines continue to grow during adulthood instead of stopping after the juvenile instars.4. The head spines grew at a constant allometric rate over time while the tail spine grew faster as the temperature increased. Both varied significantly in length over the 3 months, with animals having the shortest spines in February and the longest in March.									81	0	1	0	74	1	84			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:A1992KB16000012

This cycle closely followed 11- and 22-year cycles in solar irradiance and local weather (e.g., winter precipitation and spring temperature), generating the hypothesis that solar activity may affect porcupine abundance through effects on local weather. We investigated the mechanisms linking porcupine abundance to local weather conditions using a 6-year study (2000-2005) involving individual mark-recapture, radio tracking, seasonal survival analyses and identification of mortality causes. Summer (May-August) survival was high and constant over the study period, whereas winter (August-May) survival was lower and varied during the duration of our study. Variations in local winter precipitation explained 89% of the variation in winter survival. Porcupine predation rates appeared strongly related to snow conditions; 95% of depredated porcupines were killed when snow was covering the ground, and predation rates were higher in years with increased winter precipitation. Our data thus support the hypothesis that changes in predation rates under different snow conditions were the mechanism relating climate to porcupine population dynamics, via modifications of the local predator-prey interactions and impacts on porcupine winter survival. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting an effect of climate on predator-prey processes. Also, it identifies one possible mechanism involved in the relationship between solar irradiance and porcupine population cycles observed at this study site over a 130-year period.									12	1	0	0	12	0	12			1438-3896			WOS:000281703800009

In this study, however, the non-indigenous ascidian Didemnum cf. perlucidum Monniot F., 1983 was discovered in coral reef environments on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Its role in the succession of a benthic community and the impact on biogeochemical features (i.e. reef cementation) was assessed by deploying terracotta settlement tiles on the reef for 24 weeks. Predator exclusion in experimental plots and naturally elevated nutrient concentrations during seasonal coastal upwelling gave insights on how settlers of D. cf. perlucidum succeed under projected environmental change. Exclusion of larger predators and grazers caused an increase of D. cf. perlucidum coverage on tiles from 7 to > 80%. Due to its rapid proliferation, D. cf. perlucidum grew over calcifying reef organisms, such as barnacles, polychaetes, and crustose algae, and significantly decreased the accumulation of inorganic carbon on the settlement tiles by one order of magnitude (4.6 to 0.4 mg C cm-(2)). The combination of reduced predation and eutrophication revealed negative synergistic effects on the accumulation of inorganic carbon. The opportunistic reaction of D. cf. perlucidum to environmental changes was further evident by 2-fold increased growth rates that were positively correlated (r (2) = 0.89) to seawater particulate organic matter (POM) concentration during coastal upwelling. These results suggest that D. cf. perlucidum is a strong spatial competitor in Eastern Tropical Pacific coral reefs that face changing environmental conditions, e.g. overfishing and eutrophication. The effects of this species on disturbed benthic communities, but also its potential role as a habitat modifier, is likely significant. Thus, a continuous monitoring of D. cf. perlucidum is recommended to better understand their effects on post-disturbance dynamics in coral reef ecosystems.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1798-6540	1818-5487		WOS:000418011300002

Here, using the puparia of an important insect disease vector, Glossinapallidipes, we examine this potential trade-off using a novel combination of an experimental approach and a population dynamics model. Specifically, we explore and dissect the interactions between plastic physiological responses, treatment-duration and -intensity using an experimental approach. We then integrate these experimental results from organismal water-balance data and their plastic responses into a population dynamics model to examine the potential relative fitness effects of simulated transient weather conditions on population growth rates. The results show evidence for the predicted trade-off for plasticity of water loss rate (WLR) and the duration of new environmental conditions. When altered environmental conditions lasted for longer durations, physiological responses could match the new environmental conditions, and this resulted in a lower WLR and lower rates of population decline. At shorter time-scales however, a mismatch between acclimation duration and physiological responses was reflected by reduced overall population growth rates. This may indicate a potential fitness cost due to insufficient time for physiological adjustments to take place. The outcomes of this work therefore suggest plastic water balance responses have both costs and benefits, and these depend on the time-scale and magnitude of variation in environmental conditions. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of plastic physiological responses and changes in population abundance in the context of environmental variability.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000330016400009	24386875

Although many of these pools become dry during summer and early autumn, they are recolonized by fish from nearby pools that overflow during winter floods. N. balsioni spawns at the end of its first year of life, when, on average, the males and females have reached 60 and 63 mm T.L., respectively, and then usually die within the next few months. The largest fish, which was one of only three in its third year of life, measured 90 mm and weighed 7.3 g. The von Bertalanfly growth curve parameters for L(x) K and t(0) were 71.2 mm, 1.69 and - 0.078 for males and 52.6 mm, 1.31 and - 0.095 for females. Fecundity ranged From 550 to 1600. N. balstoni spawns during the middle of winier, after heavy flooding and when water temperatures are at, or close to, their annual minima. This enables the larvae and young juveniles to capitalize on those aquatic organisms, especially Cladocera, which are very abundant amongst the Aooded riparian vegetation that surrounds the pools in winter and spring. Hence, the fish grow rapidly and attain an appreciable size before summer, when the increases that occur in the densities of the larger carnivorous fish species, as a result of marked declines in water levels, increases the chances of predation. By spring, when most N. balstoni exceed 25 mm T.L., the diet changes markedly to one that consists almost exclusively of terrestrial fauna. In contrast, three of the sis cu-occurring native species of teleost feed on aquatic and terrestrial fauna throughout the year, while a Further two feed only within the water column and the sixth reeds on benthic invertebrates. The pronounced shift in dirt exhibited by N. balstoni as it increases in size, allied to dietary differences amongst the other six co-occurring species, reduces any potential for interspecific competition for food resources during the summer and autumn, when such resources are declining.

By contrast, 1996-2000 had much lower medusa and higher ctenophore densities. Predation on copepods (Acartia tonsa) was intense in 1996-2000, and copepod densities were low when ctenophores were abundant. At equivalent sizes, the feeding potentials of ctenophores were greater than those of medusae, with clearance rates about 1.2 times greater by volume and about 3 times greater by carbon biomass. M. leidyi ctenophores more negatively influence copepod populations than C. quinquecirrha medusae because they are more effective predators of copepods and have broader spatial and temporal occurrence, wider salinity and temperature ranges, greater densities, and a more flexible life history. Because they consume ctenophores, C. quinquecirrha medusae positively affect copepod abundance. C. quinquecirrha and M. leidyi could be considered keystone predators because of their far-reaching effects on the plankton food web. The balance between medusae and ctenophores in Chesapeake Bay was greatly affected by climatic factors. Medusa abundances were high when dry years prevailed prior to and during 1987-1990 and 1995. By contrast, medusa abundances were low when dry and wet years alternated before and during 1996-2000. Significant variables that favored medusae in 1987-1990 and 1995 were high salinity, warm temperature, and high solar irradiance. The North Atlantic Oscillation Index was significantly inversely correlated with medusa numbers from 1960-1995. Climate clearly affects gelatinous predator abundances. with consequences that cascade throughout the plankton food web.									143	6	1	0	129	0	151			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000226406800035

The dry weight of food remaining in the stomachs of piscivorous trout decreased exponentially with time. Gastric evacuation rates increased exponentially with increasing temperature but were unaffected by predator size, meal size or type of fish prey.2. Mathematical models were developed to estimate both the rate and time for the gastric evacuation of different meal sizes (expressed as dry weight), and were applicable to piscivorous trout of different sizes (length range 10-32 cm) feeding on trout fry or sticklebacks at different temperatures (range 5-18-degrees-C).3. The wet weight of food in the stomachs also decreased exponentially with time, but evacuation rates both increased with temperature and decreased with increasing meal size; the latter relationship occurred because relative rates of water loss from a meal also decreased with increasing meal size. Use of wet or dry weights can therefore lead to different conclusions about the effect of meal size on evacuation rates.4. When piscivorous trout were fed three consecutive meals of varying size, the models predicted the total dry weight of food left in the stomach, but not the weight remaining for each individual meal. Interactions between meals led to an increase in evacuation rates for meals consumed early in the series and a decrease in evacuation rates for later meals.5. Evacuation rates for piscivorous trout were compared with those for trout feeding on invertebrates in an earlier study, and were close to those for caddis larvae as prey, higher than those for mealworms and lower than those for a variety of invertebrate prey. Although a great deal is now known about the daily food intake and growth rates of trout feeding on invertebrates, there is little comparable information for piscivorous trout.									49	7	0	0	47	0	57			0046-5070			WOS:A1991FR30400009		
J	Leach, Foss								Fishing in pre-European New Zealand								ARCHAEOFAUNA				15				15	+						OCT 2006	2006	New Zealand was first discovered less than one thousand years ago by people from Eastern Polynesia, who were ancestors of the present New Zealand Maori. They were the descendants of people with a long maritime tradition, who took their first steps into the Oceanic world east of New Guinea some 35,000 years ago. By the time these people had settled the far flung islands of the Pacific and reached New Zealand they possessed advanced fishing technology and deep knowledge of fish habits and ecology. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the archaeozoology of fishing in prehistoric New Zealand. It begins with preliminary sections describing the tropical Pacific background to New Zealand archaeology, and the methodologies which are used in New Zealand relating to fishing and the analysis of fish remains. This is followed by a description of the New Zealand fishery, and the species which were caught by prehistoric Maori.A database in the Museum of New Zealand contains information on fish remains from 126 archaeological sites covering all regions and periods in New Zealand (total MNI=40,400). Although about 750 species are present in New Zealand waters, only about 35 occur in prehistoric catches, and of these only 6 occur with abundances over 7%. These are: barracouta, Thyrsites atun (Gempylidae) blue cod, Parapercis colias (Mugiloididae); snapper, Pagrus auratus (Sparidae); wrasses (Labridae); red cod, Pseudophycis bachus (Moridae); and greenbone, Odax pullus (Odacidae). Together these make up 85% of all fishes caught in prehistoric times. The technology and material culture associated with these prehistoric catches are described, tracing the knowledge of cordage and knots, netting and fish hooks, canoe design, fish preservation and cooking methods. Special attention is given to the functional attributes of the rotating hook, so common throughout Oceania. The economic basis of prehistoric Maori society varied markedly in New Zealand from horticultural people in the north to hunter-gatherers in the south. Regionalism in fish catches is examined, and although a biogeographical base to this can be identified, there is also a strong cultural expression over the top of it.A large section of the paper is concerned with changes in fish catches over archaeological time. Two aspects are considered -changes in relative abundance of fish types over time, and changes in size-frequency diagrams over time. It is found that New Zealand-wide trends have very little meaning, but that changes relating to the activities of essentially individual prehistoric communities show significant trends. These changes are presented after first considering climate change over the last 1,000 years and, in particular, the way that this affected surface sea water temperatures. There is increasing evidence that the so-called Little Ice Age was important in New Zealand, resulting in dramatic changes in fish recruitment rates, and in one case the extinction of a spawning population. This was the genetically distinctive snapper population of Tasman Bay in the northern South Island. This is reflected in the absence of snapper in prehistoric catches in this area during the period of the Little Ice Age.Of special interest is the finding that sustained predation in many parts of New Zealand resulted in increasing fish size over archaeological time. This is attributed to the widespread Polynesian custom of taking all fish, no matter how small, putting pressure on juveniles to increase their growth rate. This conclusion is supported by experimental research on preferential targeting of fish of different sizes, resulting in rapid evolution through genetic selection.The role of fish in early New Zealand diet is then considered, bearing in mind fundamental aspects of human nutritional needs. It is shown that protein was effectively super-abundant in prehistoric New Zealand, largely because of the wealth of marine foods available, and that the more important consideration was access to fat and/or carbohydrate foods. Isotope research on human bone collagen shows that food deriving from the marine environment varied from about 11% for inland people to 61% for some coastal peoples.The final part of the paper is concerned with modelling human predation and its effect on marine environments. It is suggested that archaeologists need to be a great deal more careful in this field in future and work from the bottom up, not the top down. In particular, optimal foraging theory is criticised as naive and not well founded in evidence in the case of marine food gathering. The widespread custom of 'slash and burn and fallow' has a counterpart in marine harvesting whereby people take all specimens down to very small size, depleting an area of its biomass, and then move away to a new settlement, leaving the former area to recover over long periods. There is considerable evidence for such a pattern of exploitation of the marine environment. This is a conservation strategy not often considered by archaeologists or in modern fisheries management. Prehistoric Maori fishermen in New Zealand were clearly extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of the New Zealand fishery. The abundance of fish available meant that all necessary food could be obtained in shallow waters, more than 80% being caught less than 100 metres from the shore.									13	0	0	0	5	0	13			1132-6891			WOS:000242023500001

Exploitation, as well as habitat degradation and associated changes in prey availability are key drivers of this process of trophic downgrading. In the short term, longevity and dietary adaptability of large-bodied consumers can mask potential sublethal effects of a changing prey base, producing a delayed effect that may be difficult to detect. In coral reef ecosystems, regime shifts from coral- to algae-dominated states caused by coral bleaching significantly alter the assemblage of small-bodied reef fish associated with a reef. The effects of this changing prey community on reef-associated mesopredators remains poorly understood. This study found that the total diversity, abundance and biomass of piscivorous mesopredators was lower on regime-shifted reefs than recovering reefs, 16years after the 1998 mass coral bleaching event. We used stable isotope analyses to test for habitat-driven changes in the trophic niche occupied by a key piscivorous fishery target species on reefs that had regime-shifted or recovered following climatic disturbance. Using morphometric indices, histology, and lipid analyses, we also investigated whether there were sublethal costs for fish on regime-shifted reefs. Stable isotopes demonstrated that fish from regime-shifted reefs fed further down the food chain, compared to recovering reefs. Lower densities of hepatocyte vacuoles in fish from regime-shifted reefs, and reduced lipid concentrations in spawning females from these reefs, indicated a reduction in energy stores, constituting a sublethal and potential delayed effect on populations. Reduced energy reserves in mesopredators could lead to energy allocation trade-offs, and decreased growth rates, fecundity and survivorship, resulting in potential population declines in the longer term.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000426503900021

Scymnus species belong to a poorly known Coccinellidae group of biological control agents. In this study we aimed to evaluate the suitability of Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Aphis fabae Scopoli and Melanaphis donacis (Passerini) (Homoptera: Aphididae) as prey for S. subvillosus. To achieve this, we determined (i) the temperature and prey-dependence for development and survival of the immature stages, (ii) the prey-dependence for reproductive performance at 25 A degrees C and (iii) the voracity and nutritional physiology of the 4th larval instar fed on A. fabae. The development time from first instar larva to adult decreased with increasing temperature, ranging from 61.5 days at 15 A degrees C to 10.4 days at 30 A degrees C. To complete immature development on M. donacis, the lower development threshold (LDT) was estimated to be 11.7 A degrees C and the sum of effective temperatures (SET) to be 196.3 degree-days (DD). At 15 A degrees C, larvae failed to develop when fed on A. fabae or M. persicae but on M. donacis 22 % of the larvae survived. We also found that development time of immature stages was prey-dependent, with M. persicae being the least suitable prey. The reproductive parameters were prey-dependent, with A. fabae and M. donacis allowing better performance than M. persicae. Twelve-hour-old 4th instars of S. subvillosus ingested 3.23 mg of biomass per day corresponding to an average of 10.5 aphids of A. fabae, allowing for a daily mean weight gain of 0.71 mg. The conversion efficiency and relative growth rate obtained were approximately 21 and 48 %, respectively. The results obtained in the present study suggest that both A. fabae and M. donacis are more suitable prey for development and reproduction of S. subvillosus than M. persicae.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000351531400010

Here we develop a high-resolution, spatially explicit model of coral dynamics on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our model accounts for biological, ecological and environmental processes, as well as spatial variation in water quality and the cumulative effects of coral diseases, bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris), and tropical cyclones. Our projections reconstruct coral cover trajectories between 1996 and 2017 over a total reef area of 14,780 km(2), predicting a mean annual coral loss of -0.67%/year mostly due to the impact of cyclones, followed by starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching. Coral growth rate was the highest for outer shelf coral communities characterized by digitate and tabulate Acropora spp. and exposed to low seasonal variations in salinity and sea surface temperature, and the lowest for inner-shelf communities exposed to reduced water quality. We show that coral resilience (defined as the net effect of resistance and recovery following disturbance) was negatively related to the frequency of river plume conditions, and to reef accessibility to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, reef resilience was substantially lower within no-take marine protected areas, however this difference was mostly driven by the effect of water quality. Our model provides a new validated, spatially explicit platform for identifying the reefs that face the greatest risk of biodiversity loss, and those that have the highest chances to persist under increasing disturbance regimes.									23	0	0	0	18	0	23			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000477087100020	30900790	
J	Simmons, AM; Legaspi, JC								Survival and predation of Delphastus catalinae (Coleoptera : Coceinellidae), a predator of whiteflies (Homoptera : Aleyrodidae), after exposure to a range of constant temperatures								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				33	4			839	843		10.1603/0046-225X-33.4.839				AUG 2004	2004	dDelphastus catalinae (Horn) is a predator of whiteflies that has shown promise as a tool in pest management strategies. Exposure to short-term temperature extremes can affect the survival of predators in a greenhouse or field environment. The B-biotype sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), survives the winters of mild climates (where temperatures are commonly above 0degreesC), but it is not known if D. catalinae can survive such winters. The influence of constant temperature on the survival of D. catalinae was determined in the laboratory using eggs and nymphs of the B-biotype B. tabaci. Over 90% of the adult beetles exposed to temperature regimens of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35degreesC for 24 h survived when confined with hosts. The lower and tipper thresholds for survival over that duration were around 0 and 40degreesC, respectively; similar to1% of the insects survived temperatures beyond these extremes. Survival of D. catalinae pupae was similar to that of adults. Adult D. catalinae survived up to 5.8 mo when confined on a plant infested with whitefly eggs and nymphs and held at 25degreesC; 50% of the cohort survived for 3.4 mo. Those held in a similar test at 35degreesC lived up to 0.6 mo. The number of immature whiteflies consumed during 24 h by adult D. catalinae generally increased with temperatures of 14-30degreesC. This study provides information on temperatures that may affect the survival of D. catalinae during commercial shipment and after release for biological control in the field or greenhouse, and it may help in the understanding of their ability to survive mild winters.									19	0	0	0	18	0	20			0046-225X			WOS:000223650800008

One component of OA is a decline in seawater pH, an alteration known to disrupt organism behaviors underlying predator-prey interactions. To date, however, studies examining OA's effects on feeding relationships consider predominantly simple direct interactions between consumers and their food sources. Here, we extended these established approaches to test how decreased seawater pH might alter cascading effects that span tiered linkages in trophic networks. We employed a model shoreline food web incorporating a sea star predator (Leptasterias hexactis), an herbivorous snail prey (Tegula funebralis), and a common macroalgal resource for the prey (Mazzaella flaccida). Results demonstrate direct negative effects of low pH on anti-predator behavior of snails, but also weakened indirect interactions, driven by increased snail consumption of macroalgae even as sea stars ate more snails. This latter outcome arose because low pH induced 'foolhardy' behaviors in snails, whereby their flight responses were supplanted by other activities that allowed for foraging. These findings highlight the potential for human-induced changes in seawater chemistry to perturb prey behaviors and trophic dynamics with accompanying community-level consequences.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000482243500021	31327076

Although behavior typically occurs on much faster timescales than demography, it can nevertheless influence demographic processes. Here, we use detailed data on behavior and empirical estimates of demography from a coral reef ecosystem to develop a coupled behavioraldemographic ecosystem model. Analysis of the model reveals that behavior and demography feed back on one another to determine how the ecosystem responds to anthropogenic forcing. In particular, an empirically observed feedback between the density and foraging behavior of herbivorous fish leads to alternative stable ecosystem states of coral population persistence or collapse (and complete algal dominance). This feedback makes the ecosystem more prone to coral collapse under fishing pressure but also more prone to recovery as fishing is reduced. Moreover, because of the behavioral feedback, the response of the ecosystem to changes in fishing pressure depends not only on the magnitude of changes in fishing but also on the pace at which changes are imposed. For example, quickly increasing fishing to a given level can collapse an ecosystem that would persist under more gradual change. Our results reveal conditions under which the pace and not just the magnitude of external forcing can dictate the response of ecosystems to environmental change. More generally, our multiscale behavioral-demographic framework demonstrates how highresolution behavioral data can be incorporated into ecological models to better understand how ecosystems will respond to perturbations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000579507500005	32989156

We exposed field-collected juveniles of Asterias rubens from Kiel Fjord (western Baltic Sea) to 3 seawater CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels (ranging from around 650 to 3500 mu atm) in a long-term (39 wk) and a short-term (6 wk) experiment. In both experiments, survival and calcification were not affected by elevated pCO(2). However, feeding rates decreased strongly with increasing pCO(2), while aerobic metabolism and NH4+ excretion were not significantly affected by CO2 exposure. Consequently, high pCO(2) reduced the scope for growth in A. rubens. Growth rates decreased substantially with increasing pCO(2) and were reduced even at pCO(2) levels occurring in the habitat today (e.g. during upwelling events). Sea stars were not able to acclimate to higher pCO(2), and growth performance did not recover during the long-term experiment. Therefore, the top-down control exerted by this keystone species may be diminished during periods of high environmental pCO(2) that already occur occasionally and will be even higher in the future. However, some individuals were able to grow at high rates even at high pCO(2), indicating potential for rapid adaption. The selection of adapted specimens of A. rubens in this seasonally acidified habitat may lead to higher CO2 tolerance in adult sea stars of this population compared to the juvenile stage. Future studies need to address the synergistic effects of multiple stressors such as acidification, warming and reduced salinity, which will simultaneously impact the performance of sea stars in this habitat.									19	1	0	0	18	0	19			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000341570100018

However, bycatch risk may differ on temporal and spatial scales due to the uneven distribution and effort of fleets operating different fishing gear, and to focal species distribution and foraging behavior. Scopoli's shearwater Calonectris diomedea is a long-lived seabird that experiences high bycatch rates in longline fisheries and strong population-level impacts due to this type of anthropogenic mortality. Analyzing a long-term dataset on individual monitoring, we compared adult survival (by means of multi-event capture-recapture models) among three close predator-free Mediterranean colonies of the species. Unexpectedly for a long-lived organism, adult survival varied among colonies. We explored potential causes of this differential survival by (1) measuring egg volume as a proxy of food availability and parental condition; (2) building a specific longline bycatch risk map for the species; and (3) assessing the distribution patterns of breeding birds from the three study colonies via GPS tracking. Egg volume was very similar between colonies over time, suggesting that environmental variability related to habitat foraging suitability was not the main cause of differential survival. On the other hand, differences in foraging movements among individuals from the three colonies expose them to differential mortality risk, which likely influenced the observed differences in adult survival. The overlap of information obtained by the generation of specific bycatch risk maps, the quantification of population demographic parameters, and the foraging spatial analysis should inform managers about differential sensitivity to the anthropogenic impact at mesoscale level and guide decisions depending on the spatial configuration of local populations. The approach would apply and should be considered in any species where foraging distribution is colony-specific and mortality risk varies spatially.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000425396700034	29178374

As changes in climate may affect trophic levels differentially, we hypothesized that a lack of synchrony between chick hatch and resource peaks could decrease growth rates in chicks of shorebirds nesting in the High Arctic. To test this hypothesis, we compared growth curves of chicks hatching in synchrony with peak periods of food abundance to those hatching outside of these peak periods. We also tested for changes in lay dates of shorebirds in the Canadian Arctic using recent and historical data. Mean daily temperatures during the laying period increased since the 1950s by up to 1.5 degrees C, and changes in lay dates were apparent for three shorebird species, yet differences in median lay dates between 1954 and 2005-2008 were only significant for White-romped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis (Viellot, 1819)). During 2005-2008, there was only 1 year of relatively high synchrony between hatch and resource peaks. Asynchrony between hatch and peaks in Tipulidae biomass reduced growth rates in chicks of Baird's Sandpiper (Calidris bairdii (Coues, 1861)).

Although arctic arthropods can complete their development at very low temperatures, the predicted climatic changes may shift their phenology outside its normal range. Hence, arctic arthropods may become exposed to conditions to which they are not adapted. On the basis of long-term data from several plots of pitfall and window traps at Zackenberg in high-arctic Northeast Greenland, we document that the timing of emergence is closely related to date of snowmelt in nine taxa of common surface-active and flying arthropods. Average air temperature seemed to play a lesser role, although the duration from snowmelt to the date when 50% of the individuals in the season were caught (date50) was negatively related to the average daily air temperature during the same time interval in three of the nine taxa. Since short-term weather fluctuations appeared to have a small effect on capture numbers in pitfall and window traps, we suggest that timing of snowmelt is a good predictor of the phenology of most arthropods in high-arctic Greenland. The spatial synchrony of capture numbers between individual traps within plots was high. However, among pairs of plots, the spatial synchrony varied between taxa and habitats and declined with distance, between plots for surface-dwelling taxa and with difference in timing of snowmelt for the most abundant families of Diptera (Muscidae and Chironomidae). Detritus feeders (collembolans, mites and most larvae of Diptera) and predators (spiders of the families Linyphiidae and Lycosidae) were abundant throughout the summer season. In contrast, the abundance of more specialized groups, like butterflies (e.g., Nymphalidae) and parasitoid wasps (e.g., Ichneumonidae), was restricted to a narrow seasonal time window in the warmest part of the summer. Because of their narrow phenological range and their host specialization, these taxa may be most vulnerable to trophic mismatch. Furthemore, snowmelt is predicted to become more variable, and this may affect organisms in areas of late snowmelt most severely.									75	1	0	0	71	0	78			0065-2504		978-0-12-373665-9	WOS:000256528000013

While variation in nutrient recycling stoichiometry has been well-studied among species, the mechanisms that explain intraspecific variation in recycling N:P are not well-understood. We examined the relative importance of potential drivers of variation in nutrient recycling by the fish Gambusia marshi among aquatic habitats in the Cuatro Cienegas basin of Coahuila, Mexico. There, G.marshi inhabits warm thermal springs with high predation pressure as well as cooler, surface runoff-fed systems with low predation pressure. We hypothesized that variation in food consumption among these habitats would drive intraspecific differences in excretion rates and N:P ratios. Stoichiometric models predicted that temperature alone should not cause substantial variation in excretion N:P, but that further reducing consumption rates should substantially increase excretion N:P. We performed temperature and diet ration manipulation experiments in the laboratory and found strong support for model predictions. We then tested these predictions in the field by measuring nutrient recycling rates and ratios as well as body stoichiometry of fish from nine sites that vary in temperature and predation pressure. Fish from warm, high-predation sites excreted nutrients at a lower N:P ratio than fish from cool, low-predation sites, consistent with the hypothesis that reduced consumption under reduced predation pressure had stronger consequences for P retention and excretion among populations than did variation in body stoichiometry. These results highlight the utility of stoichiometric models for predicting variation in consumer-driven nutrient recycling within a phenotypically variable species.									14	0	0	0	12	0	14			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000436869900005	29882955

The stream pools inhabited by A. barbouri are consistently more ephemeral than the ponds used by A. texanum, and the former is known to have a shorter larval period. We reared larvae from hatching through metamorphosis in a common laboratory environment, and monitored individual activity, feeding, growth and the length of the larval period. Our first goal was to examine whether these sibling species differ in behavior and growth rates. The stream species exhibited greater overall levels of activity, and both grew and fed at higher rates than the pond species. Our second goal was to examine the benefits of increased activity in terms of feeding, growth and developmental rates. Within species, increased activity was related to increased feeding, growth and developmental rates, and feeding rate was positively related to both growth and developmental rates. Our final goal was to address the costs of activity by looking at the effects of food deprivation and temperature on activity. The results of this experiment showed that larvae of the stream species reduced their activity in response to deprivation, and reduced activity to a greater degree at higher temperatures. The activity of pond species did not differ with either temperature or food deprivation. This study suggests that differences in behavior are associated with differences in habitat duration, and that behavioral variation may influence the timing of ontogenetic niche shifts such as metamorphosis through effects on growth and developmental rates.									38	0	0	0	37	0	39			0030-1299			WOS:A1996VC12500016

Chronic exposure to these contaminants might alter the response to environmental changes through interference with the regulation of corticosterone (CURT), a glucocorticoid stress hormone released by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Positive and negative relationships between CURT and environmental contaminants have been reported in polar seabirds. However, patterns appear inconclusive and it is difficult to attribute these relationships to a dysfunction of the HPA axis or to other confounding effects. In order to explore the relationships between the HPA axis activity and contaminants, we tested whether different aspects of the HPA axis of an Arctic seabird, the black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, would be related to blood Hg, PCB and OCP concentrations. Male kittiwakes were caught during the incubation period in Svalbard and were subjected to different stress series: (I) a capture-restraint stress protocol, (2) an injection of dexamethasone (DEX) that enabled to test the efficacy of the HPA negative feedback and (3) an injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that informed on the adrenal responsiveness. The HPA axis activity was unrelated to Sigma OCPs and Hg. However, birds with high concentrations of Sigma PCBs released more CURT after the ACTH injection. It is suggested that Sigma PCBs may increase the number of ACTH-receptors on the adrenals. Additionally, hatching date was delayed in males with higher concentrations of Sigma PCBs and Sigma OCPs. This study gives new evidence that PCBs and adrenal activity may be related. Thus high PCB burden may make individuals more prone to other stressors such as ongoing climate change.

J	Leonard, GH								Latitudinal variation in species interactions: A test in the New England rocky intertidal zone								ECOLOGY				81	4			1015	1030						APR 2000	2000	How species interactions vary as a function of habitat characteristics continues to be an important debate in ecology. Using the barnacle-seaweed assemblage common in New England rocky intertidal habitats, I tested the hypothesis that species interactions switch from negative to positive at sites across the Cape Cod faunal barrier because of latitudinal variation in thermal stress and predation intensity between these regions. I manipulated Ascophyllum nodosum canopies in the high zone of two sites from each region and then determined the consequences for underlying Semibalanus balanoides recruits and adults for two years (January 1995 through January 1997). In both years, algal canopies reduced barnacle recruitment and growth rates at all sites but greatly increased survival rates only at the southern sites. When integrated in a demographic framework, these data showed that the reproductive fitness potential of individuals was facilitated by the algal canopy at southern sites but was reduced under similar conditions at northern sites. At southern sites, this was likely the result of buffering from physical stresses in the absence of predators. At northern sites, any buffering from physical stress was likely offset by an increase in mortality in the presence of predators. Interestingly. this variability in species interactions appealed to be associated with subtle variation in climate. Facilitation was evident only during 1995, the warmest year on record since 1900. In contrast, interactions were entirely negative during 1996, a slightly cooler year. These results suggest that species interactions in the intertidal zone may be sensitive to even subtle changes in climate. Interspecific buffering of neighbors from thermal stress is likely to be common in other systems and suggests that both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation may become increasingly important to local species persistence as climates change during the next century.									109	1	0	0	98	0	109			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000086351500013

In this context, we used a bioenergetics model (Wiens and Innis, 1974) to estimate the seasonal variation in daily insect consumption by natural populations of the great tit (Parus major) in organic apple orchards. This model allowed us to estimate the changes in both adult densities and energy requirements in a P. major population, using field-measured parameters such as the brood size, and the length of incubation. The calculation of insect consumption rate by birds was based on both the existing literature on great tit diets and the simulated energy requirement of a great tit population. The effect of a temperature increase on energy requirement has been quantified. This study opens the way to consider the functional role of birds in agricultural landscapes and how this role may translate to ecosystem services.					10th International Symposium on Modelling in Fruit Research and Orchard Management10th International Symposium on Modelling in Fruit Research and Orchard Management	JUN 05, 2015JUN 05, 2015	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Montpellier, FRANCEMontpellier, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62611-56-6	WOS:000431840600043

Body size differences can be further altered by density-dependent competition, though synergistic effects of density and phenology on species interactions are rarely evaluated. We tested how field-realistic variation in phenology and density affected ringed salamander (Ambystoma annulatum) predation on spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and whether these altered salamander dynamics resulted in trophic cascades. In outdoor mesocosms, we experimentally manipulated ringed salamander density (low/high) and breeding phenology (early/late) of both species. Ringed salamander body size at metamorphosis, development, and growth were reduced at higher densities, while delayed phenology increased hatchling size and larval development, but reduced relative growth rates. Survival of ringed salamanders was affected by the interactive effects of phenology and density. In contrast, spotted salamander growth, size at metamorphosis, and survival, as well as the biomass of lower trophic levels, were negatively affected primarily by ringed salamander density. In an additional mesocosm experiment, we isolated whether ringed salamanders could deplete shared resources prior to their interactions with spotted salamanders, but instead found direct interactions (e.g., predation) were the more likely mechanism by which ringed salamanders limited spotted salamanders. Overall, our results indicate the effects of phenological variability on fitness-related traits can be modified or superseded by differences in density dependence. Identifying such context dependencies will lead to greater insight into when phenological variation will likely alter species interactions.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000413691100014	28894959

Receding sea ice changes the lightscape of high-latitude oceans and more light will penetrate into the sea. This affects bottom-up control through primary productivity and top-down control through vision-based foraging. We model effects of sea-ice shading on visual search to develop a mechanistic understanding of how climate-driven sea-ice retreat affects predator-prey interactions. We adapt a prey encounter model for ice-covered waters, where prey-detection performance of planktivorous fish depends on the light cycle. We use hindcast sea-ice concentrations (past 35years) and compare with a future no-ice scenario to project visual range along two south-north transects with different sea-ice distributions and seasonality, one through the Bering Sea and one through the Barents Sea. The transect approach captures the transition from sub-Arctic to Arctic ecosystems and allows for comparison of latitudinal differences between longitudes. We find that past sea-ice retreat has increased visual search at a rate of 2.7% to 4.2% per decade from the long-term mean; and for high latitudes, we predict a 16-fold increase in clearance rate. Top-down control is therefore predicted to intensify. Ecological and evolutionary consequences for polar marine communities and energy flows would follow, possibly also as tipping points and regime shifts. We expect species distributions to track the receding ice-edge, and in particular expect species with large migratory capacity to make foraging forays into high-latitude oceans. However, the extreme seasonality in photoperiod of high-latitude oceans may counteract such shifts and rather act as a zoogeographical filter limiting poleward range expansion. The provided mechanistic insights are relevant for pelagic ecosystems globally, including lakes where shifted distributions are seldom possible but where predator-prey consequences would be much related. As part of the discussion on photoperiodic implications for high-latitude range shifts, we provide a short review of studies linking physical drivers to latitudinal extent.									28	0	0	0	25	0	28			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000414969000031	28657128

Gastric evacuation rate increased exponentially with increasing temperatrure, but the results suggest that gastric evacuation rates of burbot at low temperatures are lower than those of other freshwater fish species. Temperature and the ratio of meal weight to burbot weight were the most important factors affecting gastric evacuation rate. There was no significant difference in gastric evacuation rate between three different prey species: vendace, perch Perca fluviatilis, and smelt Osmerus eperlanus.

Dietary studies give vital insights into foraging behaviour, with implications for understanding changing environmental conditions and the anthropogenic impacts on natural resources. Traditional diet sampling methods may be invasive or subject to biases, so developing non-invasive and unbiased methods applicable to a diversity of species is essential. We used digital photography to investigate the diet fed to chicks of a prey-carrying seabird and compared our approach (photo-sampling) to a traditional method (regurgitations) for the greater crested tern Thalasseus bergii. Over three breeding seasons, we identified >24000 prey items of at least 48 different species, more than doubling the known diversity of prey taken by this population of terns. We present a method to estimate the length of the main prey species (anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) from photographs, with an accuracy <1mm and precision similar to 05mm. Compared to regurgitations at two colonies, photo-sampling produced similar estimates of prey composition and size, at a faster species accumulation rate. The prey compositions collected by two researchers photo-sampling concurrently were also similar. Photo-sampling offers a non-invasive tool to accurately and efficiently investigate the diet composition and prey size of prey-carrying birds. It reduces biases associated with observer-based studies and is simple to use. This methodology provides a novel tool to aid conservation and management decision-making in the light of the growing need to assess environmental and anthropogenic change in natural ecosystems.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			2041-210X	2041-2096		WOS:000395092500008

Leptodora is a key species in many temperate freshwater systems, but so far its role in the food web could not be properly evaluated because detailed information about its secondary production was lacking.

Employing improved methods to estimate growth and instar durations, we cultured Leptodora kindtii in the laboratory at four constant temperatures (15, 17.5, 20 and 25 degreesC). Growth in length and development times of eggs and instar stages were assessed.3. Growth rates at 15, 17.5 and 20 degreesC were similar, but at 25 degreesC growth was distinctly faster. At 17.5 degreesC we observed seven juvenile instar stages before the first adult instar stage was reached.									17	0	0	0	14	0	18			0046-5070			WOS:000224434500003

Our objective was to investigate how physical ocean conditions impact distribution of seabirds along latitudinal gradients. We tested the hypothesis that seabird biogeographic patterns reflect differences in ocean conditions relating to the boundary between northern and southern shelf ecosystems. We used a grid-based approach to develop spatial means (1975-2014) of summertime seabird species' abundance, species' richness, and a multivariate seabird assemblage index to examine species composition. Seabird indices were linked to ocean conditions derived from a data-assimilative oceanographic model to quantify relationships between physics (e.g., temperature, salinity, and current velocity), bathymetry and seabirds along latitudinal gradients. Species assemblages reflected two main sources of variation, a mode for elevated richness and abundance, and a mode related to partitioning of inner/middle shelf species from outer shelf-slope species. Overall, species richness and abundance increased markedly at higher latitudes. We found that latitudinal changes in species assemblages, richness and abundance indicates a major shift around 59-60 degrees N within inner and middle shelf regions, but not in the outer shelf. Within the middle shelf, latitudinal shifts in seabird assemblages strongly related to hydrographic structure, as opposed to the inner and outer shelf waters. As expected, elevated species richness and abundance was associated with major breeding colonies and within important coastal foraging areas. Our study also indicates that seabird observations supported the conclusion that the oceanographic model captured mesoscale variability of ocean conditions important for understanding seabird distributions and represents an important step for evaluating modeling and empirical studies. Biogeographic assessments of LMEs that integrate top predator distributions resolve critical habitat requirements and will benefit assessment of climate change impacts (e.g., sea-ice loss) predicted to affect high-latitude marine ecosystems.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0924-7963	1879-1573		WOS:000418215000004

Multi-predator assemblages, dive type, bathymetry and sex influence foraging success and efficiency in African penguins								PEERJ				8						e9380	10.7717/peerj.9380				JUN 30 2020	2020	Marine predators adapt their hunting techniques to locate and capture prey in response to their surrounding environment. However, little is known about how certain strategies influence foraging success and efficiency. Due to the miniaturisation of animal tracking technologies, a single individual can be equipped with multiple data loggers to obtain multi-scale tracking information. With the addition of animal-borne video data loggers, it is possible to provide context-specific information for movement data obtained over the video recording periods. Through a combination of video data loggers, accelerometers, GPS and depth recorders, this study investigated the influence of habitat, sex and the presence of other predators on the foraging success and efficiency of the endangered African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, from two colonies in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Due to limitations in the battery life of video data loggers, a machine learning model was developed to detect prey captures across full foraging trips. The model was validated using prey capture signals detected in concurrently recording accelerometers and animal-borne cameras and was then applied to detect prey captures throughout the full foraging trip of each individual. Using GPS and bathymetry information to inform the position of dives, individuals were observed to perform both pelagic and benthic diving behaviour. Females were generally more successful on pelagic dives than males, suggesting a trade-off between manoeuvrability and physiological diving capacity. By contrast, males were more successful in benthic dives, at least for Bird Island (BI) birds, possibly due to their larger size compared to females, allowing them to exploit habitat deeper and for longer durations. Both males at BI and both sexes at St Croix (SC) exhibited similar benthic success rates. This may be due to the comparatively shallower seafloor around SC, which could increase the likelihood of females capturing prey on benthic dives. Observation of camera data indicated individuals regularly foraged with a range of other predators including penguins and other seabirds, predatory fish (sharks and tuna) and whales. The presence of other seabirds increased individual foraging success, while predatory fish reduced it, indicating competitive exclusion by larger heterospecifics. This study highlights novel benthic foraging strategies in African penguins and suggests that individuals could buffer the effects of changes to prey availability in response to climate change. Furthermore, although group foraging was prevalent in the present study, its influence on foraging success depends largely on the type of heterospecifics present.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000544121100003	32655991	
J	Williams, David T.; Straw, Nigel; Fielding, Nick; Jukes, Martin; Price, John								The influence of forest management systems on the abundance and diversity of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in commercial plantations of Sitka spruce								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				398				196	207		10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.014				AUG 15 2017	2017	Sitka spruce is the most widely planted conifer tree species in the UK, and is generally grown in dense monocultures managed using the clear-cut system. This study investigates the influence of alternative management systems (shelterwood and selection systems) on captures of bark beetles and associated predators. Bark beetle abundance was significantly lower in stands managed by shelterwood and selection systems when compared to mid (21-40 years old) and mature (>= 41 years old) stands managed by the clear-cutting method. The abundance of bark beetles, including individual species, within plots could not be fully explained however, using linear mixed model analysis that not only included the various site characteristics assessed within each plot (numbers of live and dead trees), but also the numbers of predatory beetles (Rhizophagidae and Salpingidae). This suggested that the influence of management type on bark beetle abundance was not entirely due to the bottom-up or top-down forces that were assessed in the study, and that other abiotic and/or biotic factors were likely to be influential. Bark beetle diversity was also influenced by the management system, however higher diversity values within some group selection managed plots were only apparent in circumstances when stands of Sitka spruce had been managed using this system for a considerable period of time, and the habitat had remained undisturbed for a relatively long period of time (i.e. no harvesting interventions). Significantly higher numbers of predatory beetles. were captured within the mid and mature clear-cut managed stands. The results from the study indicate that adopting alternative management systems to manage Sitka spruce in the UK could be a potential strategy to mitigate likely increases in bark beetle populations associated with climate change.

Although delayed compared to areas to the north and south, SSWD was initially most intense in north and central Oregon and spread southward. Up to 90% of individuals showed signs of disease from June-August 2014. In rocky intertidal habitats, populations of the dominant sea star Pisaster ochraceus were rapidly depleted, with magnitudes of decline in density among sites ranging from -2x to -9x (59 to 84%) and of biomass from -2.6x to -15.8x (60 to 90%) by September 2014. The frequency of symptomatic individuals declined over winter and persisted at a low rate through the spring and summer 2015 (similar to 5-15%, at most sites) and into fall 2015. Disease expression included six symptoms: initially with twisting arms, then deflation and/or lesions, lost arms, losing grip on substrate, and final disintegration. SSWD was disproportionally higher in orange individuals, and higher in tidepools. Although historically P. ochraceus recruitment has been low, from fall 2014 to spring 2015 an unprecedented surge of sea star recruitment occurred at all sites, ranging from similar to 7x to 300x greater than in 2014. The loss of adult and juvenile individuals in 2014 led to a dramatic decline in predation rate on mussels compared to the previous two decades. A proximate cause of wasting was likely the "Sea Star associated Densovirus" (SSaDV), but the ultimate factors triggering the epidemic, if any, remain unclear. Although warm temperature has been proposed as a possible trigger, SSWD in Oregon populations increased with cool temperatures. Since P. ochraceus is a keystone predator that can strongly influence the biodiversity and community structure of the intertidal community, major community-level responses to the disease are expected. However, predicting the specific impacts and time course of change across west coast meta-communities is difficult, suggesting the need for detailed coast-wide investigation of the effects of this outbreak.									40	0	0	0	29	0	40			1932-6203			WOS:000375676400036	27144391	
J	Elliott, J. Malcolm; Allonby, J. Derek								An experimental study of ontogenetic and seasonal changes in the temperature preferences of unfed and fed brown trout, Salmo trutta								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				58	9			1840	1848		10.1111/fwb.12173				SEP 2013	2013	1. This study tests the hypothesis that the temperature preferences of brown trout, Salmo trutta, vary in relation to: (i) their mass and hence their age (0+, 1+, 2+, 3+); (ii) the season (spring, summer, autumn) and hence the acclimation temperature; and (iii) whether or not the fish are fed. The experiments were performed in still water in a 3-m-long artificial channel (water depth, 0.28m). There was a temperature gradient from 25 to 0 degrees C along the channel.2. Experiments were for 0+ trout in May and for 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ trout in August and November. In each month, five trout of the same age were not fed for 2days, and then one fish was placed in the section at noon and left for 24-h habituation. The next day, starting at noon, the position of the fish was noted every 2h over 24h, and the temperature at this position was measured (n=13 readings). This procedure was repeated for each of the five fish (n=65 readings for trout of the same age in each month) and then with five continuously fed trout of the same age as the unfed trout.3. For all trout, there was a diel variation in recorded temperatures at the observed positions with the lowest values in the day and the highest at night. This diel variation was slight for 0+ trout, but more marked for older trout, especially 2+ and 3+ fish. The overall mean preferred temperature decreased markedly with trout mass and age from 16.3 degrees C for 0+ unfed fish to 12.0 degrees C for 3+ unfed fish and from 14.5 degrees C for 0+ fed fish to 9.5 degrees C for 3+ fed fish. The mean preferred temperature was always lower for fed trout than for unfed trout.4. There was also an ontogenetic increase in the variation in individual temperature preferences around the mean value for both unfed and fed trout (CV% increased with fish mass and age). Neither the season (spring, summer, autumn) nor the acclimation temperature had any obvious effect on the mean preferred temperature.5. Therefore, the temperature preferences of brown trout were not constant but varied ontogenetically and whether or not the fish were fed. It is concluded from comparisons with earlier studies that the temperature preferences for fed juveniles (0+, 1+) were similar to their optimum temperature for growth rate, whereas the lower values for older fed trout were similar to their temperature for maximum conversion efficiency of energy intake to growth, thereby optimising growth efficiency rather than growth rate.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0046-5070			WOS:000321328800007		
J	Mori, M.; Butterworth, D. S.								A first step towards modelling the krill-predator dynamics of the Antarctic ecosystem								CCAMLR SCIENCE				13				217	277						2006	2006	The history of human harvests of seals, whales, fish and krill in the Antarctic is summarised briefly, and the central role played by krill emphasised. The background to the hypothesis of a krill surplus in the mid-20th century is described, and the information on population and trend levels that has become available since the postulate was first advanced is discussed. The objective of the study is to determine whether predator-prey interactions alone can broadly explain observed population trends without the need for recourse to environmental change hypotheses. A model is developed including krill, four baleen whale (blue, fin, humpback and minke) and two seal (Antarctic fur and crabeater) species. The model commences in 1780 (the onset of fur seal harvests) and distinguishes the Atlantic/Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean in view of the much larger past harvests in the former. A reference case and six sensitivities are fitted to available data on predator abundances and trends, and the plausibility of the results and the assumptions on which they are based is discussed, together with suggested further areas for investigation. Amongst the key inferences of the study are that: (i) species interaction effects alone can explain observed predator abundance trends, though not without some difficulty; (ii) it is necessary to consider other species, in addition to baleen whales and krill, to explain observed trends - crabeater seals seemingly play an important role and constitute a particular priority for improved abundance and trend information; (iii) the Atlantic/Indian Ocean sector shows major changes in species abundances, in contrast to the Pacific Ocean sector, which is much more stable; (iv) baleen whales have to be able to achieve relatively high growth rates to explain observed trends; and (v) Laws' (1977) estimate of some 150 million tonnes for the krill surplus may be appreciably too high as a result of his calculations omitting consideration of density-dependent effects in feeding rates.									48	1	0	0	50	0	57			1023-4063			WOS:000242336000012

While declining coral cover can reduce the abundance of reef fishes through direct effects on recruitment and/or mortality, recent evidence suggests that individuals may survive in disturbed habitats, but may experience sublethal reductions in their condition. This study examined the response of 2 coral associated damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus, to varying levels of live coral cover. Growth, persistence, and the condition of individuals were quantified on replicate coral colonies in 3 coral treatments: 100% live coral (control), 50% live coral (partial) and 0% live coral (dead). The growth rates of both species were directly related to the percentage live coral cover, with individuals associated with dead corals exhibiting the slowest growth, and highest growth on control corals. Such differences in individual growth between treatments were apparent after 29 d. There was no significant difference in the numbers of fishes persisting or the physiological condition of individuals between different treatments on this time-scale. Slower growth in disturbed habitats will delay the onset of maturity, reduce lifetime fecundity and increase individual's vulnerability to gape-limited predation. Hence, immediate effects on recruitment and survival may underestimate the longer-term impacts of declining coral on the structure and diversity of coral-associated reef fish communities.

Diet breadth was narrow, reflecting the low prey diversity observed in the benthos. A gradual ontogenetic shift from small prey such as amphipods to larger prey like polychaetes and bivalves was observed. Amphipods had positive electivity values in the upper estuary and negative values in the lower estuary.Polychaetes showed the inverse pattern. Bivalve electivity values were always positive. Differential selectivity throughout the estuary was mainly related to spatial segregation of flounders according to size, with the smaller individuals concentrating in the upper estuary and larger individuals concentrating in the lower estuary. Amphipods such as Corophium spp. play a crucial role in the flounder diet because of their small size, low mobility and diel activity pattern. As prey, the polychaete value increases throughout flounder ontogeny since the flounder size range is compatible with the larger mouth gapes and detection ability of larger fish. Bivalve electivity values for flounder are mainly related to high calorific values. The absence of Crangon crangon (Linnaeus, 1758) in the diet may be due to low water temperature since the cost-benefit involved in the capture of highly mobile prey is too high at low temperatures. It was concluded that flounder must use several sensory features to detect and capture prey in turbid estuarine waters and that field studies provide important background information on the actual predator preferences under natural conditions.									23	0	0	0	24	0	24			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000255714400003		
J	Hewitt, Laura C.; Shipp, Les; Buitenhuis, Rose; Scott-Dupree, Cynthia								Seasonal climatic variations influence the efficacy of predatory mites used for control of western flower thrips in greenhouse ornamental crops								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				65	4			435	450		10.1007/s10493-014-9861-4				APR 2015	2015	The influence of seasonal greenhouse climate on the efficacy of predatory mites for thrips control was determined for potted chrysanthemum. Trials in controlled environment chambers, small-scale greenhouses and commercial greenhouses were conducted to determine which biological control agent-that is, Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot or Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans)-is more efficacious for control of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), in different seasons. Under simulated summer conditions, no differences were observed in the predation and oviposition rates of both predatory mites in the laboratory trials. However, small-scale greenhouse trials showed that A. swirskii performed better than N. cucumeris in summer (i.e., more efficacious thrips control, higher predator abundance and less overall damage to the crop). Under simulated winter conditions, laboratory trials demonstrated variable differences in predation rates of the two predatory mites. The small-scale greenhouse trials in winter showed no differences in thrips control and predatory mite abundance between the two predatory mites, but plants with A. swirskii had less damage overall. The results from the small-scale trials were validated and confirmed in commercial greenhouse trials. Overall, A. swirskii performed better in the summer and equally good or better (less damage overall) under winter conditions, whereas N. cucumeris is a more cost effective biological control agent for winter months.									7	1	0	0	6	0	7			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000353286700003	25408478	
J	Weissberger, EJ; Grassle, JP								Settlement, first-year growth, and mortality of surfclams, Spisula solidissima								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				56	3-4			669	684		10.1016/S0272-7714(02)00218-4				MAR 2003	2003	As part of a long-term study of factors affecting inshore recruitment of surfclams, Spisula solidissima (Dillwyn) at 12-m deep sites off New Jersey, USA, we followed patterns of settlement and growth of surfclams and their invertebrate predators in benthic samples taken from July 1993 to July 1996. A large pulse of surfclam settlement occurred in late June or early July in all four years. There was also evidence of low-level settlement as late as December in some years. The highest settling density, which occurred in 1993, was 2.4 x 10(5) m(-2). This was the only cohort to survive to the following year in substantial numbers. Settlement appeared to be correlated with downwelling following near-shore upwelling events. The naticid gastropod predator Neverita duplicata Say settled at approximately the same time as surfclams while the naticid Euspira heros Say appears to have settled later. Crab predators (Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus), Cancer irroratus Say and Pagurus longicarpus Say) settled later in the summer. Timing of settlement by sea stars Asterias forbesi (Desor) was variable relative to surfclam. settlement. Predator abundances were highly variable among samples, but in general were three orders of magnitude lower than surfclam abundances. Naticid boreholes in the juvenile surfclam death assemblage were used to estimate the impact of naticid predation, to determine whether or not naticids were size-selective predators, and to estimate naticid growth rates. Naticid predation never accounted for >21% of surfclam mortality, and was usually <10%. From June to October, the mean size of surfclams consumed by naticids was close to the mean size available. From October to December, coincident with a sharp decline in surfclam growth, the mean size of clams consumed by naticids was greater than the mean size available. Based on maximum abundances of sea stars and previously determined laboratory feeding rates, recently settled sea stars may have consumed 4.2 x 10(3) clams m(-2) d(-1), and naticids may have consumed 90 clams m(-2) d(-1). Surfclam growth rates varied during the summer, and between years (range = 14.6 to 63.5 pm shell length d(-1)), in part reflecting low and high bottom temperatures during near-shore upwelling and downwelling events, respectively. Surfclams ceased growing over the winter. Maximum length of surfclams at 6 months post-settlement was 16 mm, smaller than the length reported by other researchers. This suggests site specific differences in first-year growth, or the possibility that others may have overestimated first-year growth. We conclude that inshore surfclam growth is temperature dependent, and that survival to one year is dependent on high-density surfclam settlement in the preceding summer.

For example, many coral reef fish populations are maintained by the movement of individuals from spatially segregated juvenile habitats (i.e., nurseries, such as mangroves and seagrass beds) to areas preferred by adults. It is presumed that nursery habitats provide for faster growth (higher food availability) and/or low predation risk for juveniles, but empirical data supporting this hypothesis is surprisingly lacking for coral reef fishes. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms (growth, predation risk, and reproductive investment) that give rise to the distribution patterns of a common Caribbean reef fish species, Haemulon flavolineatum (French grunt). Adults were primarily found on coral reefs, whereas juvenile fish only occurred in non-reef habitats. Contrary to our initial expectations, analysis of length-at-age revealed that growth rates were highest on coral reefs and not within nursery habitats. Survival rates in tethering trials were 0% for small juvenile fish transplanted to coral reefs and 24-47% in the nurseries. As fish grew, survival rates on coral reefs approached those in non-reef habitats (56 vs. 77-100%, respectively). As such, predation seems to be the primary factor driving across-ecosystem distributions of this fish, and thus the primary reason why mangrove and seagrass habitats function as nursery habitat. Identifying the mechanisms that lead to such distributions is critical to develop appropriate conservation initiatives, identify essential fish habitat, and predict impacts associated with environmental change.									62	1	0	0	62	1	63			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000285782600008	21072542

Two shellfish species dominate: Turbo sarmaticus and Dinoplax gigas. An abrupt shift in the relative frequencies of these species occurs in the middle of the sequence with T. sarmaticus almost completely replacing D. gigas. The shift in dominant species is likely due to environmental change caused by fluctuating sea levels rather than change in sea surface temperatures. The shellfish assemblage shows that local coastal habitats at Klipdrift Cave were somewhat different from those of contemporaneous sites in the southern Cape. Although the shellfish specimens are smaller at Klipdrift Cave than those from Middle Stone Age localities such as Blombos Cave, there is no robust indication that larger human populations at Klipdrift Cave during the Oakhurst period might have caused this change in size. Environmental or ecological factors could have restricted shellfish growth rates as some experimental works have suggested, but this possibility also remains to be further explored.Significance:The dominance of D. gigas and T. sarmaticus at Klipdrift Cave is surprising, as it indicates a local habitat slightly different from other similar sites during the Oakhurst period.The shift in dominance from D. gigas to T. sarmaticus indicates changing climatic and environmental conditions during the Oakhurst period, 14-7 ka.									2	0	0	0	1	1	2			0038-2353	1996-7489		WOS:000487931200002

While the effect of fishing on marine ecosystems has been widely explored, much less is known about the ecosystem effects of fish body size decrease. Here we used a marine ecosystem model to compare how fishing and small (<0.1% yr(-1)) but continuous (50 yr) decreases in the average body sizes of 5 Australian demersal fish species affect ecosystem indicators, biomasses and diets of different species. We found that decreasing growth rate of the 5 species had similar and comparable impact as the introduction of fishing of these 5 species at fishing mortality rate of F = 0.2 yr(-1). The same applied when impacts of decrease in size were compared to those of increasing fishing from F = 0.2 to F = 0.4. This suggests that declines in body size alone can lead to ecosystem responses similar in magnitude to those caused by moderate fishing. On average, body size decrease alone caused more qualitative changes in diets of all species and larger changes in the predation mortality of slower growing species than the introduction or intensification of fishing. The overall ecosystem response to fishing and slower growth of fish was largely similar and additive, suggesting that decreasing sizes of harvested fishes are likely to amplify the effects of fishing.									13	0	0	0	10	0	13			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000330356000017

Oysters were sampled monthly in 2007 and 2008 to examine the impacts of changing environmental conditions on oyster populations. Oysters were also examined quarterly for the presence of Perkinsus marinus. Filtration rates were calculated as a function of oyster size, temperature, salinity, and total suspended solids. Flood events in 2007 caused temporary reductions in salinity and were associated with reductions in oyster abundance, spat settlement, disease levels (weighted prevalence and percent infection), and filtration rates. Oyster populations had generally recovered within 1 year's time-the oysters were younger and smaller but were just as abundant as pre-flood levels. The rapid return of oysters to pre-flood abundance levels is attributed in part to the ability of oysters in Gulf coast estuaries to spawn multiple times in a single season and in part to their relatively high growth rates. Although flood disturbance may temporarily reduce or destroy oyster populations, the ability of the Mission-Aransas Estuary to retain freshwater pulses within the system and maintain low salinities that are unfavorable for predators and disease can facilitate oyster population recovery. Episodic flood events appear to play a critical role in promoting long-term oyster population maintenance in the Mission-Aransas Estuary. The response of oysters to changing environmental conditions over the short term provides some insights into the potential long-term effects of changing climate.									65	1	0	0	59	0	65			1559-2723			WOS:000287155800016

Increased activity in the non-dispersive larval stage is an important ecologically relevant trait in aquatic communities that may be expected to evolve in the edge populations (i) as a result of the combination of spatial sorting in dispersal-related adult activity and a coupling between adult and larval behaviour and (ii) to meet higher energy demands to allow higher growth rates and a higher investment in costly dispersal-related traits.We specifically address whether activity is higher in the larval non-dispersive aquatic stage at an expanding range front by comparing larvae of replicated core and edge populations of the damselfly Coenagrion scitulum in three common garden experiments where larvae were reared from the egg stage.As expected, activity in the non-dispersive larval stage was consistently higher in the edge populations. Although changes in larval activity probably have consequences for ecological interactions, the higher activity was not associated with increased predation rates by dragonfly larvae, potentially because of associated compensatory changes in other antipredator mechanisms.We documented one of the few cases of a positive coupling of activity in the larval and adult stages. Yet, contrary to larval activity, adult activity did not differ between core and edge populations. This indicates that the higher larval activity we documented is not shaped by a coupling with adult activity. Instead, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a higher energy need in edge populations shaped the higher larval activity. Edge larvae showed a higher growth rate which is expected to evolve at the initial low population densities in newly founded edge populations. Moreover, higher growth rate showed the expected positive covariation with larval activity.Increases in activity in the non-dispersive stage in edge populations at an expansion front should be included in the ongoing debate whether evolutionary changes at invasion fronts are driven by adaptive versus non-adaptive evolution. Moreover, they may have the potential to affect ecological interactions at expanding range fronts.									21	0	0	0	21	0	21			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000333964700013

Examining potential benefits of group living in a sawfly larva, Perga affinis								BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY				20	3			657	664		10.1093/beheco/arp048				MAY-JUN 2009	2009	Although defense may serve as a primary selective force behind the evolution and maintenance of social behavior, numerous other benefits play a role as well. Larvae of the Australian sawfly, Perga affinis, live in colonies and retain their gregarious lifestyle through pupation. To evaluate selective pressures maintaining social behavior in P. affinis, I investigated potential benefits of group living. These included predation protection, immune function, thermoregulation, foraging facilitation, and pupation success where I compared treatments between individuals versus groups and between groups of different sizes. I found no evidence of predation on larvae; however, the mortality risk was significantly higher for single versus grouped larvae, suggesting that other grouping benefits are important. Immune function was not a benefit as hemolymph from single versus grouped larvae did not differ in its ability to limit bacterial growth. Investigating thermoregulation revealed that grouped larvae attained significantly higher temperatures than single individuals and that large groups reached higher temperatures than small groups. Larvae grew significantly faster at higher temperatures, indicating that the increased heat absorption and retention capacity of large groups may speed up development. Group size did not affect foraging facilitation (measured via weight gain) except during the last time period, where individuals in large groups gained significantly more weight. Weight gain in the last instar may be critical for pupation as high larval weight significantly increased the odds of pupation success. Thus, the group size effect on weight gain during the last instar provides an adaptive explanation for the observed ontogenetic increase in colony size and coalescence.									11	1	0	0	13	0	13			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000265950200027

However, the significance of this group as prey remains challenging to assess, and hence, gelatinous consumers are often depicted incorrectly as dead ends of pelagic food webs. In the Southern Ocean, where a shift in trophic webs may favour gelatinous animals, we video-monitored prey intake of a key predator. Twenty-eight chick-rearing Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae from Dumont d'Urville station (66 degrees 40'S, 140 degrees 01'E) were instrumented with miniaturized video loggers in 2014-2015. Among other items (krill, fish), 101 gelatinous organisms (n = 79 jellyfish, 6 salps and 16 unidentified) were observed on 13 of 21 exploitable video footages (total: 59 h). Importantly, 65.3 % of gelatinous organisms were attacked, but among them salps were not attacked. Attacks on jellyfish were significantly associated with the visible presence of the jellyfish's gonad. Jellyfish were encountered at an average depth of 26.2 +/- 10.4 m, significantly shallower than krill. Attacks occurred mostly during bottom, but also descent or ascent dive phases. Concomitant GPS location for four birds revealed that attacks on jellyfish occurred above the shelf, 35 km north from the colony, where sea ice concentration reached 88 %. These results indicate that Adelie penguins occasionally feed on jellyfish, even though other prey types are also available. Refining our perception of scyphozoans' niche may thus help anticipate the functional response of the food webs to the extensive changes witnessed in the Antarctic environment.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000375330500015

We tested the hypothesis that biotic interaction strength increases toward the equator, using a global experiment with model caterpillars to measure predation risk. Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal gradient spanning six continents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching gradients at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic interaction strength, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.									147	0	0	0	121	0	148			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000401508400045	28522532

These structures become colonised by sedentary organisms and non-migratory reef fish, and form local ecosystems that attract larger predators including seals, birds, and fish. It is possible that these structures form a system of interconnected reef environments through the planktonic dispersal of the pelagic stages of organisms by ocean currents. Changes to the overall arrangement of hard substrate areas through removal or addition of individual man-made structures will affect the interconnectivity and could impact on the ecosystem. Here, we assessed the connectivity of sectors with oil and gas structures, wind farms, wrecks, and natural hard substrate, using a model that simulates the drift of planktonic stages of seven organisms with sedentary adult stages associated with hard substrate, applied to the period 2001-2010. Connectivity was assessed using a classification system designed to address the function of sectors in the network. Results showed a relatively stable overall spatial distribution of sector function but with distinct variations between species and years. The results are discussed in the context of decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure in the North Sea.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			2045-2322			WOS:000446339400056	30283099

The survival rate of translocated corals in restoration projects is around 65%. This rate is, however, highly variable among projects, with success ranging from 0 to 90% and with detachment being a significant cause of mortality. Improving the speed and strength of coral self-attachment would increase survivorship in translocated corals. To address this need, we tested whether fragments of the scleractinian coral Hydnophora rigida, artificially attached upside-down, would self-attach more rapidly to the substratum than those artificially attached the right way up, which is the normal practice. We also tested the effect of three different diets (unfed, normal Artemia, and lipid-enriched Artemia) on coral growth and other biological responses. After 100 days, our results demonstrated that corals fixed upside-down grew significantly wider and faster over the substratum than corals fixed the right way up. A significantly higher number of fragments fixed upside-down were also able to self-attach and grow over the substratum (87%) compared with fragments fixed the right way up (58%). Neither the buoyant weight, height increment, symbiont density, chlorophyll, maximum quantum yield nor color of corals fixed upside-down differed significantly from corals fixed the right way up. Our data show that simply inverting the orientation of coral fragments may substantially accelerate the time for self-attachment and increase the survival rate of translocated corals in restoration projects.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1061-2971	1526-100X		WOS:000449709700014

The ways that fluctuations in prey abundance and weather conditions can affect reproductive output in a 'capital breeding' ectotherm, the aspic viper ( Vipera aspis) were examined.2. Our longitudinal study confirms that female aspic vipers adjust reproductive investment by integrating allocations of energy from stores ('capital') and facultative feeding ('income'). Thus, long-term energy storage enabled females to reproduce successfully even in years when prey were scarce.3. Not surprisingly, temporal changes in body reserves of female vipers preparing for reproduction depended upon current feeding rates. However, the mean environmental temperature during the active season also affected mass gain.4. Allometric patterns suggest that reproductive output was limited by energy availability in 8 out of the 9 years of our study. In the other year, high prey availability in the preceding season meant that reproductive output was maximized within the constraints set by maternal body size (and thus, abdominal volume).5. High summer temperatures increased basking opportunities of gravid vipers and thus accelerated gestation. However, maternal metabolic costs also increased in such situations, resulting in low postpartum body condition.									99	0	0	0	99	0	102			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000175536600009

Native biota within these stressed systems are also impacted by reductions in habitat availability, decreased hydraulic diversity, increased sedimentation, movement barriers, invasive species and altered flows that may profoundly change the character and functioning of rivers. Construction or enlargement of reservoirs is continuing, and whilst downstream impacts are often considered, upstream impacts receive far less attention. We develop a population model to examine the impacts of reservoir expansion on a threatened riverine species in South Eastern Australia: the two-spined blackfish. We examined two processes, loss of breeding habitat and increased predation, directly linked to reservoir expansion as well as a broader threat of recruitment failure due to sedimentation. These threatening processes were assessed using the expected minimum population size as an indicator of risk. As is often the case for threatened species, limited data were used to parameterise the model and sensitivity analysis performed to assess the appropriateness of the model parameterisation. The outcomes indicate that the two-spined blackfish population is vulnerable to the loss of breeding habitat particularly if two-spined blackfish are unable to spawn in the larger dam, although this vulnerability is ameliorated if the whole river is accounted for. Including possible impacts from the resident trout population for the whole river, indicates the two-spined blackfish to be vulnerable to low level predation particularly if the trout population have a high growth rate. Population modelling has rarely been used to predict the consequences of dam construction on aquatic species/communities. The example here shows it to be a powerful tool to visualise and quantify potential biodiversity outcomes.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1470-160X	1872-7034		WOS:000406436100021

Because the total caloric value of food consumed by experimental lake trout was significantly different during the two years in which the studies were done, separate annual energy budgets were formulated. The gross conversion efficiency in yearling lake trout fed ad libitum rations of alewives at 10-degrees-C was 26.6% to 41%. The distribution of energy with temperature was similar for each component of the energy budget. Highest conversion efficiencies were observed in fish fed less than ad libitum rations; fish fed an amount of food equivalent to about 4% of their body weight at 10-degrees-C had a conversion efficiency of 33% to 45.1%. Physiologically useful energy was 76.1-80.1% of the total energy consumed. Estimated growth for age-I and -II lake fish was near that observed for laboratory fish held at lake temperatures and fed reduced rations.									6	0	0	0	6	0	7			0270-5060			WOS:A1993MN45900006

Within these regions, marine mammal consumption appears frequent relative to the more fish-based diet within traditional habitats. To provide insight into feeding habits of northward range-expanding killer whales, full-depth blubber fatty acid signatures from 21 free-ranging killer whales from southeast Greenland, Faroe Islands, and Denmark were compared to those of 4 managed-care killer whales, which were fed a constant, long-term fish diet. We analyzed the entire blubber layer in 10 equal-length subsections to evaluate how fatty acid stratification throughout blubber depth may influence fatty acid-based feeding evaluations. Specific fatty acid markers previously linked to marine mammal feeding in other killer whale populations were significantly higher in free-ranging killer whales relative to managed-care individuals, suggesting that marine mammals represent a time-integrated component of free-ranging killer whales' diet. Unlike the managed-care whales, fatty acid signatures were highly variable among the free-ranging killer whales, suggesting that either they are generalists or exhibit inter-individual feeding variation. All samples, regardless of origin, showed stratification of fatty acid signatures through blubber layers. Dietary fatty acids generally occurred in higher proportions and were more variable in the inner-most layers for the free-ranging whales. These data suggest that superficial blubber sampling through biopsy darting may not capture fine-scale and/or short-term variation in diet, and therefore the sampling approach should be carefully considered in research using fatty acids to evaluate feeding ecology of killer whales and other cetaceans.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000446469100001

LAWRENCE ESTUARY								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				34	3			737	741		10.2983/035.034.0302				DEC 2015	2015	In the spring of 2007, a small number of empty valves from the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians (Lamarck), were observed at several locations in Pomquet Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada. Snorkeling surveys at selected sites in the harbor were carried out in spring 2007, summer 2007, and spring 2008. Scallop densities were very low in all sampling times, ranging between 0.04 and 0.053 scallops/m(2). The size distributions from 2007 suggested a single cohort of 0 + individuals, with one 1 + scallop. The 2008 samples were predominantly 1 + scallops, with five 0 + individuals. Four marked scallops from 2007 were collected alive in 2008, demonstrating their ability to overwinter. These scallops had an average daily growth rate of 0.08 mm/day from July 2007 to May 2008. A thermistor deployed in the same eelgrass beds indicated that the scallops survived extended periods of time with temperatures below 0 degrees C. In 2013, four of the sites were surveyed again, and dramatic increases in density were recorded, averaging 1.713 scallops/m(2). The bay scallops in Pomquet Harbour probably represent an incidental introduction, as larvae, from aquaculture operations similar to 80 km to the north.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000367745300002

In those lakes, roach abundance was only little affected by the abiotic and biotic variables such as lake characteristics, water transparency, nutrient concentrations, pH or related variables, predation and competition. This was probably due to the generalist characteristics of the roach as it is adaptive to a wide variety of environments. Instead, the population structure and agespecific growth of the roach were strongly affected by various environmental variables. The growth rate was negatively related to water colour, calcium and nutrient concentration and roach abundance, and positively related to perch abundance and lake size. The growth patterns and relatively stable abundance showed flexibility in adaptation to different environmental conditions. Our results indicate that the ongoing environmental changes, recovery from acidification and brownification may notably affect the structure and production of roach populations, and may alter the role of the roach in lake ecosystems.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1239-6095	1797-2469		WOS:000397203800009

Current data suggest that juveniles may be sedentary in this region. We investigated the relative importance of oxygen for juvenile growth in different areas occupied by juveniles in the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL). More specifically, we examined the mean size-at-age for 1- and 2-year-old juveniles as well as the growth rate in different areas in relation to oxygen, depth, temperature, and juvenile density. Overall, oxygen concentration was found to affect juvenile Greenland Halibut growth: growth rate varied inversely with dissolved oxygen levels and significantly decreased when oxygen conditions were below 80 mu mol/L (similar to 25% saturation). Temperature did not affect juvenile growth rates within the range found in these areas (4.95-5.14 degrees C). Mean lengths in 1- and 2-year-old juveniles (17 and 27 cm, respectively) as well as length increment estimates from 1 to 2 years old in the EGSL were much higher than those observed in other populations of Greenland Halibut. Length increment from ages 1 and 2 ranged between 8 and 12 cm for temperatures varying from 3.7 to 5.5 degrees C. We found the highest abundance of juveniles in bottom waters characterized by low oxygen concentrations and also found that there was continuous juvenile growth over the year; these observations suggest that the negative impacts of dissolved oxygen should be limited and/or largely compensated by other physical or biological characteristics of the EGSL, such as food abundance, food availability, and/or predator density.

Anthropogenic nutrient loading, which is often rich in nitrate, inhibits coral growth and worsens corals' response to warming while natural sources of nitrogen, such as ammonium from fish excretion, promotes coral growth. Although the effects of nutrient loading and ocean warming have been well-studied, it remains unclear how these factors may interact with biotic processes, such as corallivory, to alter coral health and the coral microbiome. This study examined how nitrate vs. ammonium enrichment altered the effects of increased seawater temperature and simulated parrotfish corallivory on the health of Pocillopora meandrina and its microbial community. We tested the effects of nitrogen source on the response to corallivory under contrasting temperatures (control: 26 degrees C, warming: 29 degrees C) in a factorial mesocosm experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia. Corals were able to maintain growth rates despite simultaneous stressors. Seawater warming suppressed wound healing rates by nearly 66%. However, both ammonium and nitrate enrichment counteracted the effect of higher temperatures on would healing rates. Elevated seawater temperature and ammonium enrichment independently increased Symbiodiniaceae densities relative to controls, yet there was no effect of nitrate enrichment on algal symbiont densities. Microbiome variability increased with the addition of nitrate or ammonium. Moreover, microbial indicator analysis showed that Desulfovibrionaceae Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are indicators of exclusively temperature stress while Rhodobacteraceae and Saprospiraceae OTUs were indicators of high temperature, wounding, and nitrogen enrichment. Overall, our results suggest that nitrogen source may not alter the response of the coral host to simultaneous stressors, but that the associated microbial community may be distinct depending on the source of enrichment.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2167-8359			WOS:000496712700006	31741802	
J	Lappalainen, A; Westerbom, M; Vesala, S								Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the diet of roach (Rutilus rutilus) in outer archipelago areas of the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea								HYDROBIOLOGIA				514	1-3			87	92		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018209.10032.0c				FEB 15 2004	2004	The blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) is one of the key species in the Baltic Sea ecosystem and it is living at the edge of its range in the western Gulf of Finland. Roach (Rutilus rutilus) is a freshwater fish species that has benefited from recent coastal eutrophication and is at present highly abundant in the outer archipelago of the Gulf of Finland. In 2000 and 2001, a total of 516 roach were sampled for diet analysis in three study areas. Shelled molluscs formed over 95% of the diet of roach, blue mussels being the dominant single species. The proportion of this species in the food of roach in the three study areas ranged between 38-61% for smaller roach (<225 mm) and 39-85% for larger (>225 mm) roach, indicating that blue mussel is a highly important food source for roach in outer archipelago areas of the western Gulf of Finland, in contrast to reports from other parts of the northern Baltic Sea. The scarcity of large blue mussels in mussel beds in the easternmost study area was reflected in the lower proportion of blue mussels in the diet of larger roach. However, the growth of roach was not affected by the availability of blue mussels. The twofold differences observed in the annual growth of roach between warm and cold years demonstrated that temperature is an important factor controlling the growth of roach in the western Gulf of Finland.					17th Baltic Marine Biologists Symposium17th Baltic Marine Biologists Symposium	NOV 25-29, 2001NOV 25-29, 2001		Stockholm, SWEDENStockholm, SWEDEN	12	0	0	0	11	1	12			0018-8158			WOS:000220784400009

Temporal variability in ocean climate and California sea lion diet and biomass consumption: implications for fisheries management								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				373				157	172		10.3354/meps07737				2008	2008	Key to understanding ecosystem structure and function in the California Current System is quantitative modeling of trophic interactions of California sea lions Zalophus californianus, one of the largest and most abundant predators in this system, and how these interactions are affected by climate variability. Because sea lions consume almost exclusively commercially important prey species, we hypothesized that the potential for competition for specific prey resources would vary with environmental conditions. We evaluated seasonal and annual variation in sea lion diet in Monterey Bay during the strong 1997-98 El Nino and subsequent 1999 La Nina through the examination and identification of prey hard parts found in fecal samples. Annual consumption was modeled using population size, dietary data, sea lion energetics, and prey energy content. Sea lions were plastic specialists, feeding on seasonally abundant aggregating prey, exploiting several species at. a time. Short-term seasonal changes in diet corresponded with prey movement and life history patterns, whereas long-term annual changes corresponded with large-scale ocean climate shifts, namely the large 1997-98 El Nino and 1999 La Nina. Annual sea lion consumption of specific prey varied as a function of ocean climate, with an estimated 17 154 t prey consumed in 1998 and 20 229 t in 1999, Sea lion consumption was similar in magnitude to fisheries landings for several prey species and has the potential to adversely impact specific prey resources and directly compete with these fisheries; however, the degree of competition depends on spatial and temporal overlap of fisheries and sea lion foraging efforts.									38	0	0	0	31	0	38			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000262731000013

BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				16	4			935	947		10.1007/s10530-013-0551-7				APR 2014	2014	Invasion of native habitats by exotic plants often causes reductions in faunal diversity. However, there is little direct evidence of native fauna actively avoiding invaded habitat and few quantitative studies on the mechanisms underlying such avoidance. We quantified alterations made to the composition and physical structure of an Australian tropical savanna by grader grass (Themeda quadrivalvis); an understudied invasive grass that is associated with reduced faunal abundance and diversity. We found that grader grass profoundly changed the physical structure and floral composition of tropical savanna, forming dense lawn-like monocultures unlike the native savanna. Second, we investigated the habitat preferences of small ectotherms in partially invaded habitat, using a rainbow skink (Carlia schmeltzii) as a model system and discovered that they actively avoided grader grass. Finally, we experimentally tested predictions regarding mechanisms that may have driven the avoidance of grader grass. Predation rates and food availability were not likely the cause of grader grass avoidance, because experiments using models deployed in the field showed that predation rates were higher in native grass, and collection of invertebrates in both habitats indicated that prey availability was similar. However, mesocosm experiments on habitat selection in relation to vegetation structure, along with field measures of available operative environmental temperatures, suggested that small ectotherms probably avoid grader-grass-invaded savanna due to a suboptimal thermal environment and lack of appropriate habitat structural heterogeneity.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000333011700016

Interaction between biotic and abiotic factors determines tadpole survival rate under natural conditions								ECOSCIENCE				13	3			413	421		10.2980/i1195-6860-13-3-413.1				2006	2006	The estimation of survival rates and the assessment of factors influencing variation in survival are essential to understanding population dynamics. However, in amphibians that alternate between an aquatic larval stage and a dispersing terrestrial stage, such understanding is limited due to the difficulty of estimating survival under field conditions. In this study, we obtained precise estimates of daily survival rates of tadpoles under field conditions using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods and assessed their temporal and spatial variation. Specifically, we assessed the effect of temperature, intra-specific density, and the presence of introduced bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) on the survival rate of Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla) tadpoles in southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Daily survival rates of tadpoles were relatively constant within a season and were also similar between years. Survival rates in different ponds varied from 95.4 to 87.9%.d(-1). Among-pond differences in survival were best explained by the interaction of temperature and tadpole density. At low tadpole densities, survival increased with temperature, but at high densities, survival decreased with increasing temperature. It was not possible to detect the effect of introduced bullfrogs over the variation accounted for by differences in temperature and intra-specific density. As in terrestrial vertebrates, biotic and abiotic factors interacted strongly to determine survival rates in these tadpoles.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			1195-6860	2376-7626		WOS:000240960500015

In Timor-Leste, the subspecies Chelodina mccordi timorensis is restricted to a small area of lacustrine habitat near the eastern tip of Timor around Lake Iralalaro in the Lautem District. We collected information on C. m. timorensis biology and harvest and assessed current threats and community perceptions. Data were collected during 2 surveys (February and July 2014) around Lake Iralalaro in Nino Konis Santana National Park. Threats were identified by direct observation, and local perceptions were recorded during expert interviews. Human harvest is the main threat in the area. Animals are captured using fishing line, are located using a bamboo stick in shallow water to probe the mud, or are captured by hand at the edge of the lake or under dry grass. Turtles are captured mainly during the dry season (April to October). Most experts identified C. m. timorensis under 2 different names according to the color (staining) of the plastron (veu = yellow and clear; sepe veu = dark and red). Local perspectives as to the population status of the turtle (stable, declining, or increasing) varied between 2 villages. Factors that may be reducing the capacity of this turtle to survive human harvest include predation by pigs and dogs. Fire and climate change are also likely to be important factors resulting in declines.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1071-8443	1943-3956		WOS:000377481400009

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				71	11			1625	1634		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0585				NOV 2014	2014	Understanding the impacts of hydrological drought, and the role that refugia play in mitigating these impacts, is crucial to the conservation of freshwater fishes. This is especially true for species adapted to riffles, which are typically the first habitats to dewater at low discharge. We examined the relationship among decreasing stream discharge, abundance, and habitat use for Nooksack dace (Rhinichthys cataractae ssp.), an endangered riffle-dwelling species. A complementary experimental manipulation examined the effects of flow on growth rate across a discharge gradient in riffle and pool habitats. We found that low-velocity habitats and decreased discharge in experimental channels result in reduced dace growth and that decreasing stream flow was coincident with declines in Nooksack dace abundance. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of Nooksack dace to hydrological drought, and insofar as Nooksack dace are ecologically typical of small riffle-dwelling invertivore fishes, our results suggest that use of pools does not mitigate sublethal effects of declining flows on growth, although pools may provide refuge from the most negative effects of drought (i.e., stranding of fish).									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000344604800003		
J	Chess, DW; Stanford, JA								Experimental effects of temperature and prey assemblage on growth and lipid accumulation by Mysis relicta loven								HYDROBIOLOGIA				412				155	164		10.1023/A:1003886920400				1999	1999	The opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta) is a holarctic planktivore that undergoes diel vertical migration (DVM), ascending at night from deeper water or the lake bottom into the upper water column to feed. In deep lakes that thermally stratify, M. relicta spends most of the time on or near the lake bottom in cold water where food resources are low; but, M. relicta migrates daily into warmer layers to feed where food resources are more abundant. Hence, in deep lakes M. relicta traverses steep temperature and prey density gradients while migrating through the water column to forage. We conducted a laboratory growth experiment of factorial design that simulated the range of temperatures and densities of natural zooplankton forage encountered by M. relicta during DVM. Somatic growth, measured as change in total length and lipid-free biomass, was not significantly different among experimental treatments. Analysis of variance showed that M. relicta stored energy in the form of lipid instead of using the energy mainly to drive increased somatic growth, but only at the colder temperatures. Lipid storage was 24% (+/- 4.3 sd) in 4 degrees C-high forage treatment compared to 6% (+/- 1.1) at 14 degrees C-high forage treatment. Energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of M. relicta was highest (21.3% +/- 5.8) at 4 degrees C and lowest (3.3% +/- 0.9) at 14 degrees C, regardless of prey density. The experiment showed that Mysis relicta feeds at high food densities where ECE is low, but spends most of the time in colder water where ECE is high. These results support McLaren's metabolic efficiency hypothesis, which predicts that feeding in the more productive surface waters and then migrating to colder waters is reproductively advantageous. Moreover, owing to high metabolic efficiency in the coldest waters and rapid DVM, M. relicta is able to sequester much of the epilimnetic zooplankton production near or on the lake bottom, thereby forcing the lake food web toward a configuration dominated by mysids, benthic or deepwater fishes and small, agile zooplankton.									11	1	0	0	9	0	11			0018-8158			WOS:000084827100017

This can only be achieved through a combination of experimental and field approaches that would allow developing a mechanistic understanding of impacts across level of biological organizations. Surprisingly, most published studies are still focusing on single species responses with little consideration for interspecific interactions. In this study, the impacts of a 3 days exposure to three parameters (temperature, pH, and presence/absence of the predator cue of the crab Charybdis japonica) and their interactions on an ecologically important endpoint were evaluated: the byssus production of the mussel Mytilus coruscus. Tested temperatures (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) were within the present range of natural variability whereas pH (8.1, 7.7, and 7.4) covered present as well as near-future natural variability. As expected, the presence of the crab cue induced an antipredator response in Mytilus coruscus (significant 10% increase in byssus secretion rate, 22% increase in frequency of shed byssus, and 30% longer byssus). Decreased pH but not temperature had a significant negative impact on the same endpoints (up to a 17% decrease in byssus secretion rate, 40% decrease in frequency of shed byssus, and 10% shorter byssus at pH 7.3 as compared with pH 8.1) with no significant interactions between the three tested parameters. In this study, it has been hypothesized that pH and predator cue have different modes of action and lead to conflicting functional responses (escape response versus stronger attachment). Functional consequences for ecosystem dynamics still need to be investigated.									14	1	0	0	13	0	14			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000360410500022

Estimating Density and Temperature Dependence of Juvenile Vital Rates Using a Hidden Markov Model								INSECTS				8	2					51	10.3390/insects8020051				JUN 2017	2017	Organisms in the wild have cryptic life stages that are sensitive to changing environmental conditions and can be difficult to survey. In this study, I used mark-recapture methods to repeatedly survey Anaea aidea (Nymphalidae) caterpillars in nature, then modeled caterpillar demography as a hidden Markov process to assess if temporal variability in temperature and density influence the survival and growth of A. aidea over time. Individual encounter histories result from the joint likelihood of being alive and observed in a particular stage, and I have included hidden states by separating demography and observations into parallel and independent processes. I constructed a demographic matrix containing the probabilities of all possible fates for each stage, including hidden states, e.g., eggs and pupae. I observed both dead and live caterpillars with high probability. Peak caterpillar abundance attracted multiple predators, and survival of fifth instars declined as per capita predation rate increased through spring. A time lag between predator and prey abundance was likely the cause of improved fifth instar survival estimated at high density. Growth rates showed an increase with temperature, but the preferred model did not include temperature. This work illustrates how state-space models can include unobservable stages and hidden state processes to evaluate how environmental factors influence vital rates of cryptic life stages in the wild.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2075-4450			WOS:000404617800018	28505138

Discrete meals of different sizes of krill meganyctiphanes norvegicus, mysids Neomysis integer, brown shrimp Crangon crangon. and herring Clupea harengus were fed to test the effect of prey type on the gastric evacuation. A general evacuation model without meal size as a variable was fitted to the data on dry weights by means of non-linear regression. With the exception of mysid evacuation the estimated parameters for curvature, predator weight reflect, and temperature effect of the general evacuation model were very similar for all other food types and also confirmed the results obtained with smelt Osmerus eperlanus. In contrast the evacuation of mysids showed a strong exponential curvature. rather the effect of prey size than of prey type. The prey specific evacuation constants of the model revealed a linear relationship to the energy content. A general consumption model for field estimates is presented that can be used for prey types that have not yet been tested in the experiments. provided the energy content is known.

We examined the influence of temperature on specific predatory-prey dynamics in the following two-level trophic system: the predatory fungus Lecophagus sp. and its prey Lecane inermis rotifers, both of which originated from activated sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The experiments investigating the ability of conidia to trap rotifers and the growth of fungal mycelium were performed in a temperature range that is similar to that in WWTPs in temperate climate. At 20 A degrees C, 80% of the conidia trapped the prey during the first 24 h, whereas at 8 A degrees C, no conidium was successful. The mycelium growth rate was the highest at 20 A degrees C (r = 1.44) during the first 48 h but decreased during the following 24 h (r = 0.98), suggesting the quickest use of resources. At a medium temperature of 15 A degrees C, the tendency was opposite, and the r value was lower during the first 48 h. At 8 A degrees C, the growth rate was very low and remained at the same level even though numerous active rotifers were potentially available for the fungus. The temperature also influences the production of new conidia; on the 7th day, new conidia were observed in 96% of the wells at 20 A degrees C, but no new conidia were observed at 8A degrees C. These results show that the prey (rotifers)-predator (Lecophagus) dynamics in WWTPs is temperature-dependent, and a temperature of 8 A degrees C is a strongly limiting factor for the fungus. Moderate temperatures ensure the most stable coexistence of the fungus and its prey, whereas the highest temperature can promote the prevalence of the predator.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0095-3628	1432-184X		WOS:000418740200011	28963577

When outbreaks do occur, they often coincide with warm, dry weather and at barren forest sites. A proposed reason for this is that weather and habitat affect small mammal population density (numerical response) and hence pupal predation. We propose an alternative explanation: weather and habitat affect small mammal feeding behaviour (functional response) and hence the outbreak risks of forest pest insects. We report results from laboratory and field-enclosure experiments estimating rates of pupal predation by bank voles (Myodes glareolus) on an outbreak insect, the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer), at different temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C), in different microhabitats (sheltered and non-sheltered), and with or without access to alternative food (sunflower seeds). We found that the probability of a single pupa being eaten at 20 A degrees C was lower than at 15 A degrees C (0.49 and 0.72, respectively). Pupal predation was higher in the sheltered microhabitat than in the open one, and the behaviour of the voles differed between microhabitats. More pupae were eaten in situ in the sheltered microhabitat whereas in the open area more pupae were removed and eaten elsewhere. Access to alternative food did not affect pupal predation. The results suggest that predation rates on pine sawfly pupae by voles are influenced by temperature- and habitat-induced variation in the physiology and behaviour of the predator, and not necessarily solely through effects on predator densities as previously proposed.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000345146700007	25234375

Horned lizards (Phrynosoma spp.) are myrmecophagic specialists and the abundance of ant prey make their populations vulnerable to habitat loss, as well as invasive ants and associated pest control programs. We studied ant use by Phrynosoma cornutum (Texas Horned Lizards) on an insular urban reserve in central Oklahoma that was bereft of harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.), presumed to be their chief prey. The five most commonly available ant genera based on bait station captures were Monomorium (69%), Forelius (11%), Pheidole (10%), Crematogaster (7%), and Tapinoma (2%). Based on the examination of 124 scat samples from adult and juvenile P. cornutum, Crematogaster (81%), Pheidole (12%), Formica (6%), and Monomorium (1%) were used as prey. Consumption of prey in several ant genera by P. cornutum disproportionately to their availability was related to ant mass and presumed nutritional value. Among juveniles, gape size did not influence Pheidole use but may influence Formica use. We suggest that P. cornutum are adaptive ant specialists whose populations might be maintained in habitat fragments without harvester ants as long as abundant medium-and large-sized native ant communities are present. Therefore, urban reserves, when effectively managed for native fauna, can conserve declining native species by serving as habitat havens in an otherwise unsuitable landscape.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000426848800012		
J	Sears, MW								Geographic variation in the life history of the sagebrush lizard: the role of thermal constraints on activity								OECOLOGIA				143	1			25	36		10.1007/s00442-004-1767-0				MAR 2005	2005	Thermal constraints on the time available for activity have been proposed as a proximate mechanism to explain variation in suites of life history traits. The longer that an ectotherm can maintain activity, the more time it has to forage and the greater chance that it will encounter a predator and be eaten. Thus, the thermal environment may produce a trade off between growth and survival when variation in the environment favors increased activity. I used mark-recapture data from a demographic study of three natural populations of the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus) and estimates of thermal opportunity for each population to evaluate whether variation in the thermal environment can explain patterns of growth and survival that occur over an elevational gradient. Lizards from the highest elevation population exhibited higher individual growth rates than those of lizards from lower elevation, while mortality rates increased with elevation for these populations. The covariation of fast growth and high mortality with increased thermal opportunity is the opposite trend expected if the thermal environment alone is to explain patterns of life history in these lizards. Additional factors including thermal heterogeneity in the distribution of microhabitats of lizards, adaptation to local environmental conditions, and a potential trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk need to be addressed to obtain a satisfactory explanation of the causative mechanisms producing life history variation.									69	2	0	0	68	1	70			0029-8549			WOS:000227369700003	15742218

Gastric evacuation was best described with a general model: S(t) = (S(0)(1-B) - R(1 - B)t)((1-B)-1), with S(t) = stomach content at time t, S(0) = stomach content at time 0, t = time , R, B = constants. The shape parameter was estimated as B = 0.668. For comparison with other studies, an exponential model was fitted also to the data. The evacuation constant (R) of the general gastric evacuation model increased exponentially with temperature between 7.5 and 16 degrees C. The slope of the increase was reduced between 16 and 19.5 degrees C and a slight decrease was observed between 19 and 21.5 degrees C. Additionally, the effect of mean M(D) (range 0.286 - 1.025 g) was examined.

We hypothesised that stocking rates and prey abundance would affect growth and prey consumption by influencing per-capita prey availability, and that the environmental conditions encountered by fish at the time of stocking would affect growth and consumption. 2Prey consumption of stocked rainbow trout was calculated with the Wisconsin bioenergetics model. We calculated growth trajectories of released trout based on data from stocked trout that were released in spring and autumn from 1993 to 2009 and then re-captured by anglers. Diet, prey energy density, body mass lost during spawning and lake temperature were measured locally. 3Stocking timing had no effect on return rates to anglers or length or weight of caught fish. Although trout released in autumn were smaller than those released in spring, autumn-released trout grew at a faster rate and had similar lengths and weights to spring cohorts after 2years of growth in the lake. Modelled consumption parameters were negatively correlated with trout population size, suggesting that stocking rates (347809fishha1year1) caused density-dependent effects on growth. Although common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) accounted for 85% of total prey consumption, no significant relationship was found between prey consumption by individual trout and adult smelt abundance, possibly because trout are targeting smaller smelt that our abundance estimate did not account for. 4Releasing trout in autumn appears to be advantageous for growth, possibly because (i) temperature is more suitable for growth in autumnwinter than in springsummer and (ii) prey for small trout is abundant in autumn. Mild winter conditions appear to enhance overwinter survival and growth of rainbow trout in warm-temperate lakes compared to higher latitudes. This implies that moderately productive warm-temperate lake ecosystems are highly suitable for trout growth in winter, but less so in summer, when lake stratification and high nutrient levels may create conditions suitable for algal blooms and hypolimnetic deoxygenation. High growth rates of trout in warm-temperate lakes can therefore be supported by timing releases to coincide with favourable winter conditions.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000317625900010

The mean duration of the immature stages at 26 degrees C was 21.56 +/- 2.60 days and larvae were voracious predators with a mean predation capacity of 16,60 +/- 1.76 snails. The survival period of unfed neonate larvae appeared to be temperature dependent and ranged from 2 to 29 days at 26 degrees C and 4 degrees C respectively. However, storage of freshly laid eggs at -20 degrees C for 7 days did not yield viable larvae. For the first time, the phenology of D. montana is detailed and its biocontrol potential against snail-borne diseases is discussed.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0031-0603	2162-0237		WOS:000247282600003		
J	Howell, Penelope T.; Pereira, Jose J.; Schultz, Eric T.; Auster, Peter J.								Habitat Use in a Depleted Population of Winter Flounder: Insights into Impediments to Population Recovery								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				145	6			1208	1222		10.1080/00028487.2016.1218366				2016	2016	The distribution and demographics of a population of Winter Flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were examined for changes related to habitat quality over a fishery-independent survey period of 29 years, encompassing an 82% decline in abundance. We tested for spatial and temporal variation in indicators of fitness to determine whether they revealed likely processes that resulted in the observed patterns of habitat use. We also assessed temporal changes in fitness and inferred changes in habitat quality associated with population decline. We focused on the condition of postspawn (resting) mature and immature fish of both sexes during a critical period of spring feeding prior to summer migration. Analysis of variance of individual condition indices (log(10)[length]-log(10)[weight] regression residuals) by sex/maturity group and time period identified consistent and significant differences among six survey strata. Highest condition indices were observed for fish that were captured in shallow (<18-m) mud, sand, and transitional bottom sediment and deep (>18-m) mud areas, collectively classified as high-quality habitat. The proportion of the population that occupied high-quality habitat remained unchanged at approximately 60% over the time series. As abundance decreased, condition decreased in mature females, increased in immature fish of both sexes, and was mixed in mature males. Additionally, the proportion mature at length shifted significantly upward for both sexes, the back-calculated lengths at ages 2 and 3 increased for mature individuals, and the estimated winter growth declined for age-3 mature and immature females. The results suggested increased competition for prey among mature fish and increased predation pressure on smaller fish. This Winter Flounder population may be responding to an increase in the abundance of competing mid-Atlantic species, which was brought about by increasing water temperature. These second-order effects may have chronically hindered Winter Flounder reproduction and therefore stock rebuilding, especially in areas of low-quality habitat.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000387600000006

J	DENBELDER, E; JANSEN, E								THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE, NUTRITION, LIGHT AND THE GROWTH TIME OF THE MYCELIUM ON CAPTURE AND INFECTION OF MELOIDOGYNE-HAPLA BY ARTHROBOTRYS-OLIGOSPORA								FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED NEMATOLOGY				17	1			57	66						1994	1994	An isolate of Arthrobotrys oligospora (CBS 289.82) captured the second-stage juveniles (J2) of a population of Meloidogyne hapla by attachment to its hyphae. The effects of temperature, substrate, light and ageing of fungal mycelium on the ability to capture nematodes was studied in the laboratory. Firm binding of the J2 of M. hapla to hyphae of A. oligospora (CBS 289.82) occurred within 1 h irrespective of temperature (between 5 to 30-degrees-C) and irrespective of differences in nematode mobility. Subsequent development of ring structures (comparable to adhesive networks) around the nematode, however, was significantly slower at the lower temperatures (5 to 10-degrees-C) than at the higher temperatures (15 to 30-degrees-C). The colonization of the nematode by trophic hyphae was clearly affected by temperature. At temperatures below 15-degrees-C development of trophic hyphae was significantly reduced in comparison to higher temperatures. Furthermore, the nutritional conditions tested did not correlate to the efficacy in nematode-hypha attachment, however the subsequent development of adhesive networks was delayed on water agar. The present results provide evidence that the trapping ability in the isolate tested continues over the whole test period of more than 70 days. Light dit not influence the ability of the fungus to capture nematodes. Our results suggest that the formation of an adhesive hypha is less temperature and nutrient dependent than the development of the morphologically more complex adhesive networks. This observation suggests that the range of conditions under which this isolate of A. oligospora captures nematodes is wider than in isolates where adhesive networks are the only capture devices, which makes this isolate interesting for evaluation as a possible control agent.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1164-5571			WOS:A1994MR92500005		
J	Urban, Mark C.; Richardson, Jonathan L.				Urban, Mark Christopher/Y-2430-2019				The Evolution of Foraging Rate across Local and Geographic Gradients in Predation Risk and Competition								AMERICAN NATURALIST				186	1			E16	E32		10.1086/681716				JUL 2015	2015	Multiple theories predict the evolution of foraging rates in response to environmental variation in predation risk, intraspecific competition, time constraints, and temperature. We tested six hypotheses for the evolution of foraging rate in 24 spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations from three latitudinally divergent sites using structural equation models derived from theory and applied to our system. We raised salamander larvae in a common-garden experiment and then assayed foraging rate under controlled conditions. Gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders solely explained foraging rate variation among populations at the southern site, which was dominated by this form of selection. However, at the middle and northern sites, populations evolved different foraging rates depending on their unique responses to local intraspecific density. The coupling of gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders and high intraspecific density at the middle site jointly contributed to selection for rapid foraging rate. At the northernmost site, intraspecific density alone explained 97% of the interpopulation variation in foraging rate. These results suggest that foraging rate has evolved multiple times in response to varying contributions from predation risk and intraspecific competition. Predation risk often varies along environmental gradients, and, thus, organisms might often shift evolutionary responses from minimizing predation risk to maximizing intraspecific competitive performance.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000356632700002	26098352

Effect of Different Temperature Regimes on the Biology, Reproduction and Predation of Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)								EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL				21	2			305	312						2011	2011	Effect of different temperature regimes (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on the predation rates, immature development and adult stage of Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was studied, using Aphis craccivora Koch (Homoptera: Aphididae) as prey. Results showed that temperature had significant effect on the development of H. variegata immature stages. The total developmental period (egg-adult) was shortest (12.10 days) at 30 degrees C and longest (66.70 days) at 15 degrees C. During the larval period, H variegata consumed significantly more aphids (465.7 preys) at 15 degrees C than other tested temperatures. Also, temperature had significant effects on percentages of egg viability, adult emergence and the generation survival. However, rates of larval survival were not influenced by temperature. Longevity of adult females and males was highly affected by temperature; being longest at 20 degrees C. Moreover, females of H. variegata showed the greatest fecundity of 1075 eggs at 25 degrees C, but they did not lay eggs at 15 degrees C. Adult females and males significantly consumed more aphids at 20 degrees C than other studied temperatures. Females of H. convergens that reared at 25 degrees C showed the highest net reproductive rate (R-o = 361.17 females/ female), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m) = 0.31), finite rate of increase (lambda = 1.37) and shortest generation time (T = 18.84 days) and doubling time (DT = 2.22 days) as compared to those reared at 20 and 30 degrees C. These results therefore revealed that the most suitable temperature for the rearing of H. variegata was 25 degrees C.					3rd Arab Conference of Applied Biological Pest Control3rd Arab Conference of Applied Biological Pest Control	OCT 10-12, 2011OCT 10-12, 2011		Cairo, EGYPTCairo, EGYPT	4	0	0	0	2	0	5			1110-1768	2536-9342		WOS:000301213300032		
J	Tsai, An Yi; Gong, Gwo-Ching; Shiau, Wei								Viral lysis and nanoflagellate grazing on prokaryotes: effects of short-term warming in a coastal subtropical marine system								HYDROBIOLOGIA				751	1			43	54		10.1007/s10750-014-2170-4				JUN 2015	2015	Although temperature is a key parameter in the control of the activity and growth of all microorganisms, little is known about how temperature might simultaneously affect viral lysis and nanoflagellate grazing on prokaryotes. This study investigated the effect of rising temperatures on nanoflagellate grazing, viral lysis, and prokaryotic growth in coastal waters of the western subtropical Pacific Ocean during winter (< 25A degrees C) and summer (> 25A degrees C) in 2013. To do this, water samples were incubated for 24 h at ambient and experimentally increased temperatures (averages 2-3A degrees C higher than in situ values) and analyzed for prokaryotic gross growth, grazing, and viral lysis using a modified dilution method. The experimental warming conditions were found to cause an increase in prokaryotic gross growth rates in the winter and summer season, respectively. Although the experimental warming conditions also caused an increase in the average rate at which prokaryotes were being grazed, they also caused a general decrease in viral lysis during summer. These findings suggest that short-term warming influenced the function of the microbial food web by increasing the rates of prokaryotic production and flux in prokaryotic carbon to predators.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000352082900004		
J	Walsh, Jake R.; Munoz, Samuel E.; Vander Zanden, M. Jake								Outbreak of an undetected invasive species triggered by a climate anomaly								ECOSPHERE				7	12					e01628	10.1002/ecs2.1628				DEC 2016	2016	When an invasive species appears at a new location, we typically have no knowledge of the population dynamics leading up to that moment. Is the establishment of invasive propagules closely followed by the appearance of the population? Or alternatively, was there an established low-density population that was released from a constraint and crossed the detection threshold? The early stages of the invasion process are a critical gap in our knowledge, yet vitally important for the detection and management of invasions. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence supporting the lag scenario for an invasive species outbreak. The invasive predatory zooplankton, spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), was detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (USA), in summer of 2009 and rapidly reached and sustained exceptionally high densities. To evaluate whether Bythotrephes' outbreak immediately followed introduction or erupted from an established low-density population, we constructed a population model of Bythotrephes in Lake Mendota. In the model, Bythotrephes persisted indefinitely at low levels until favorable thermal conditions in 2009, the coolest July since at least 1895, allowed it to erupt to high densities and establish a large egg bank in the lake sediments. The egg bank stabilized the population in the high-density state despite a return to nonfavorable thermal conditions, which is further supported by demographic data suggesting a constant contribution from the egg bank during the year. The prolonged lag scenario is corroborated by the detection of two individual Bythotrephes in pre-2009 archived samples, and the detection of Bythotrephes spines in lake sediment core layers dating back to 1994 (+/- 5 yr). Together, our results suggest that Bythotrephes persisted for at least a decade below the detection limit, until optimal thermal conditions triggered a population outbreak. This work highlights the potential for environmental conditions to trigger invasive species outbreaks from low-density populations.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			2150-8925			WOS:000401423700008

In the course of an 8-day mesocosm experiment, we examined the channeling, of the Saharan dust (SD) and mixed aerosols (A) effects on microplankton up to the copepod trophic level, in the highly oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Based on mesocosms with SD and A treatments, we evaluated the feeding response of the dominant copepod Clausocalanus furcatus every other day. We hypothesized that increased food availability under atmospheric deposition would result in increased copepod ingestion rates, selectivity and production. Overall, no robust pattern of food selection was documented, and daily rations on the prey assemblage of all mesocosms were very low indicating severe food limitation of C. furcatus. Although increased food availability was not true, after few days ingestion of ciliates was maximized, followed by egg production, in both the SD and A treatments, indicating their importance in the diet of this copepod as well as a response of C. furcatus feeding performance. Our results help in understanding the trophic efficiency of marine food webs in ultra-oligotrophic environments under atmospheric deposition. We suggest that future mesocosm research in oligotrophic waters should consider more than one copepod species.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4				2296-7745		WOS:000457690600035

Changes in paralarval allometry during development were strongly marked in the case of arm length: suckers were added and the arms grew concomitantly from day 10 and growth rate accelerated from day 20. Neither cannibalism nor schooling behaviour occurred during the planktonic stage. Survival rate to settlement was 8.9%. The paralarvae of O. vulgaris exhibited presettlement reflexes from day 36 and settled between days 47 and 54, suggesting considerable potential for dispersal. Comparison of these results with previous studies suggests that paralarvae settle when they reach a critical size irrespective of age, and that the duration of the planktonic period is probably temperature dependent. After settlement, octopuses still bore Koelliker organs, lacked papillae on the body surface, were capable of feeding on inert prey, and exhibited negative phototaxis and reclusive behaviour like adults. The main period of settlement under natural conditions in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea is probably September-October.									134	2	0	0	130	0	139			0706-652X			WOS:A1995UA09600011

While the importance of the thermal environment for the growth of fish is undisputed, the relevance of maternal effects for offspring growth in the wild is largely unknown. Otoliths of 366 age-0 pike (Esox lucius L.) were sampled in a natural lake over three seasons. All offspring were assigned to more than 330 potential mothers using 16 informative microsatellites. We found temperature and past maternal environment (as represented by juvenile growth rate), but not female total length, to jointly contribute to explain within- and among-season size variation in juvenile pike. While there was no statistical evidence for maternal effects on offspring growth rate, fast female juvenile growth positively correlated with the offspring length in early summer. One mechanism could be related to fast-growing females spawning somewhat earlier in the season. However, the more likely mechanism emerging in our study was that fast-growing females could have been in better condition prior to spawning, in turn possibly producing higher numbers of high-quality eggs. Our study is among the few to reveal carry-over effects related to past maternal environments on offspring performance in a naturally reproducing fish stock. At the same time, our study underscores recent arguments that size-dependent maternal effects may not be expressed in the wild and that early hatching does not generally produce size advantages in light of stochastically varying temperature conditions.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000358089400001	25894093

Images recorded 24 h a day were used to manually count and assign species based on DIDSON images of fish size, shape, and behavior. From these counts, the run size was estimated to be 1,976-2,059 individuals during the study. At first, river herring often hesitated to swim through the sample area where the weirs and DIDSON were deployed; however, they eventually did pass, often multiple times. This unique hesitation behavior complicated counting efforts, though it was beneficial to discerning species using DIDSON images. In addition, extremely shallow water upstream of the study site, lack of tree cover, and a high threat of avian predation likely contributed to river herring milling activity at the study site. By providing many clear images of river herring, DIDSON proved to be an effective type of sonar with which to monitor and count river herring continuously in a small coastal stream.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			1942-5120			WOS:000312007400050

For reef-building oysters, reefs are maintained through accumulation of shell material, which depends on recruitment and growth and which provides substrate for new generations. Knowledge of the fundamental niche of oysters in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions helps define the area where ecosystem engineers grow and survive well and where their structures are likely to persist and be effective for coastal protection. Response curves of different life-history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated along a tidal emersion gradient in a manipulative field study. Density of juvenile oysters was maximal around 36% tidal emersion. Shell growth of juveniles and adults, condition index (CI) of adults and mortality of adults were negatively related to tidal emersion, whereas mortality of juveniles was positively related to tidal emersion. Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40% tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40% tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000394183600009

Juvenile shrimps were sampled from intertidal habitats along the German Wadden Sea coast with a push net and from a power plant water inlet to quantify the share of primary females. Length-based sex ratios were determined for about 27,000 individuals using external characteristics. Observed sex ratios were mainly female-biased, and also large males occurred regularly in the catch. This indicates that sex at hatch is not male as would be characteristic for an obligate protandric hermaphrodite and that not all male shrimps change sex. A cohort-based computer simulation, including sex-specific growth rates, mortality and seasonally varying recruitment, generated sex ratios comparable to the field. The observed decline in the proportion of males with increasing size can be explained solely by faster growth of females without involving hermaphroditism. Based on temperature-dependent growth and moult rates as well as length-specific numbers of eggs per female, the potential egg production of primary and secondary females was modelled, yielding contributions of secondary females of < 1%. Sex change in C. crangon has previously been observed and may be interpreted as an evolutionary relict of this species having evolved in a habitat characterized by lower population densities, lower predation levels and increased longevity compared to today's living conditions in North Sea coastal waters.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0025-3162			WOS:000281012700018		
J	Ismar, Stefanie M. H.; Kottmann, Johanna S.; Sommer, Ulrich								First genetic quantification of sex- and stage-specific feeding in the ubiquitous copepod Acartia tonsa								MARINE BIOLOGY				165	2						10.1007/s00227-017-3281-z				FEB 2018	2018	Marine copepods provide the major food-web link between primary producers and higher trophic levels, and their feeding ecology is of acute interest in light of global change impacts on food-web functioning. Recently, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) protocols have been developed, which can complement classic diet quantification methods, such as stable isotope or fatty acid analyses tools. Here, we present first results of feeding experiments assessing sex-and stage-specific food intake by the ubiquitous calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa by 18S targeted qPCR and microscopic grazing assessment. In triplicated mixed-diet feeding treatments, three suitable A. tonsa diets, the cryptophyte Rhodomonas balthica, the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana, and the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, were offered in equal biomass proportions under constant conditions. Prey uptake substantially varied between different algal species, as did the extent of sex- and stage-specificity of prey uptake. Male adult copepods had higher R. balthica gut contents than females, and nauplii contained more of this prey source than copepodites or adult copepods in mixed treatments. A trend towards higher amounts of ingested T. weissflogii in adult females than in males and in nauplii than in other stages was detected. Genetic gut content quantifications indicated low feeding on I. galbana, and no consistent sex- or stage-specific differences of I. galbana content in A. tonsa. Our results highlight diet-specific feeding differences between Acartia life stages and sexes, which can have implications on food-web dynamics and specific nutrient transfer to higher trophic levels in copepod populations of varying age composition under changing environmental parameters, such as rising temperatures and increasing ocean acidification.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000424326200003		
J	Kauhala, Kaarina; Bergenius, Mikaela; Isomursu, Marja; Raitaniemi, Jari								Reproductive rate and nutritional status of Baltic ringed seals								MAMMAL RESEARCH				64	1			109	120		10.1007/s13364-018-0381-1				JAN 2019	2019	The Baltic ringed seal (Pusa hispida botnica) population started to increase in numbers in the 1990s after a population decrease caused by hunting and environment pollutants. The annual growth rate of this population is about 5%, while in a fast-growing seal population, it could be as high as 10-12%. The reasons behind the fairly slow population growth rate are not known. In the current study, we investigated reproductive rate and nutritional status of ringed seals in the Bothnian Bay, the largest subpopulation in the Baltic Sea. The aims of the present study were (1) to estimate reproductive rate of females and (2) to examine especially annual variation in nutritional status (blubber thickness) in relation to prey quality and quantity as it affects reproductive rate. The proportion of females with corpus albicans (an estimate of birth rate) in Baltic ringed seals has increased from low values since the late 1990s and is at present about 72%. It was highest among females at the age of 5-12years and declined thereafter, especially after the age of 20. Uterine occlusions, which earlier caused sterility to females, were rare in recent years. Blubber thickness of both pups and older seals decreased during spring and increased during the rest of the year. Average blubber thickness of sub-adults and adults declined until the early 2000s and increased thereafter, except in adult females, and correlated positively especially with average weight of herring (Clupea harengus). In sub-adults, blubber thickness correlated also with the weight and catch size of vendace (Coregonus albula). These results suggest that the quality and quantity of important prey fish may affect the nutritional status of seals. In recent years, average blubber thickness of adult females in spring declined, although herring quality increased. This may be partly due to stress caused by poor ice conditions in the nursing period in late winter. The declining nutritional status of adult females may, at least partly, be responsible for the relatively low birth rate and population growth rate of ringed seals in the Bothnian Bay.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-2401	2199-241X		WOS:000455666000011		
J	Schroeder, Arne								Density- and Size-Dependent Winter Mortality and Growth of Late Chaoborus flavicans Larvae								PLOS ONE				8	10					e75839	10.1371/journal.pone.0075839				OCT 4 2013	2013	Winter processes such as overwinter survival and growth of individuals can have wide-ranging consequences for population dynamics and communities within and across seasons. In freshwater organisms winter processes have been mainly studied in fish despite that invertebrates also have substantial impacts on lake and pond food webs. One of the major invertebrate consumers in lake and ponds is the planktonic larvae of the dipteran insect Chaoborus spec. However, while much is known about Chaoborus feeding ecology, behaviour and structuring role in food webs, its winter ecology and how it affects its populations are poorly understood. Here size-and density-dependent winter mortality and body growth of late Chaoborus flavicans larvae were quantified over naturally occurring size and density ranges in autumn and under natural winter conditions using two field enclosure experiments. Winter mortality increased with autumn density but decreased with autumn body size while winter growth rates decreased with autumn density and body sizes. There was also a density-and size-independent background mortality component. The proportion of pupae found in spring decreased strongly and exponentially with autumn density. These results may explain the commonly observed univoltine life cycle and multi-annual density fluctuations in northern Chaoborus populations. They further demonstrate the relevance of winter processes and conditions for freshwater invertebrates and ecosystems.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000325489100074	24124517

A mesocosm approach								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				540		SI		3	10		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.03.039				JAN 1 2016	2016	Human activities have greatly increased the salt concentration of the world's rivers, and this might be amplified by water scarcity in the future. While the lethal effects \of salinity have been documented for a wide variety of stream invertebrates, the sub-lethal effects (i.e. changes in biological condition without mortality) are not deeply understood yet. One important sub-lethal effect that has yet to be investigated is changes in predation efficiency, which could trigger cascade effects associated to the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates that control algae biomass. In this study we combined the use of biomarkers with community-level data in a stream mesocosm to evaluate the potential cascade effect of increased salinity on the trophic food web. Both predation and salt treatments had an effect on the aquatic invertebrate abundance, richness and community composition. The presence of predators had a clear cascade effect, it reduced herbivorous invertebrate abundance and richness leading to higher chlorophyll a concentrations. The salt treatment significantly reduced taxa richness, but only in the gravel bed. The predators were significantly stressed by salt addition, as shown by the different analyzed biomarkers. Concordantly, in the presence of predators, Tanytarsini registered higher abundances and chlorophyll a showed a lower concentration when salt was added. However, none of these changes was significant. Therefore, although salt addition significantly stressed Dina lineata, our results suggest that a longer exposure time is needed to fully capture cascading effects (e.g. a decrease in chlorophyll a due to a relaxation of predation on herbivorous invertebrates). We suggest that the potential cascade effects of salinization need to be evaluated when addressing the impacts of water scarcity (as caused by climate change and increasing water demand) on river ecosystems, since flow reductions will lead to higher salt concentrations.

Individually marked fish from the tanks were placed in aquaria in groups of four and tested for feeding success, assessed as individual share of a group meal in three identical short-term aquarium experiments separated in time (January, May and June). The groups consisted of the same individuals in each of the three experiments. In tanks, growth (thermal growth coefficient, G(T)) was used as a measurement of feeding success. Individual G(T) in tanks was consistent over time, and individual share of a group meal in aquaria was consistent between consecutive months. There was no connection between individual feeding success in aquaria and G(T) in tanks in May and June, and in January the factors were negatively correlated. The condition factor at the start of aquarium experiments and feeding success in aquaria were negatively correlated in June and tended to be so also in May. Boldness in aquaria was negatively correlated with growth in tanks. Thus, individuals that were successful in one environment seemed to be less successful in the other. There was a seasonal change in G(T), with an increase from March to April and from April to June despite constant day length and temperature.

Photo-, mechano-, and chemoreceptors provide tools for the acquisition of information about their potential preys. The use of vision to detect prey and high attack speed seem to be a predominant pattern in cephalopod species distributed in the photic zone, whereas in the deep-sea, the development of mechanoreceptor structures and the presence of long and filamentous arms are more abundant. Ambushing, luring, stalking and pursuit, speculative hunting and hunting in disguise, among others are known modes of hunting in cephalopods. Cannibalism and scavenger behavior is also known for some species and the development of current culture techniques offer evidence of their ability to feed on inert and artificial foods. Feeding requirements and prey choice change throughout development and in some species, strong ontogenetic changes in body form seem associated with changes in their diet and feeding strategies, although this is poorly understood in planktonic and larval stages. Feeding behavior is altered during senescence and particularly in brooding octopus females. Cephalopods are able to feed from a variety of food sources, from detritus to birds. Their particular requirements of lipids and copper may help to explain why marine crustaceans, rich in these components, are common prey in all cephalopod diets. The expected variation in climate change and ocean acidification and their effects on chemoreception and prey detection capacities in cephalopods are unknown and needs future research.									18	0	0	0	15	1	18			1664-042X			WOS:000407859800001	28861006

Here, we combine laboratory and field data on tuna larvae with a model of larval foraging and bioenergetics to explore the role of cannibalism in cohort development at different temperatures, durations of hatching period, hatching larval densities and natural mortality rates. Prey fields (zooplankton densities and co-occurrence of different larval stages of 3 species of tuna) were established from cruises in a main tuna spawning area around the Balearic Islands (Mediterranean Sea). Results suggest that a pure zooplankton diet is frequently insufficient to sustain larval growth. Piscivory can be a major source of larval mortality among tuna species and larvae hatched early can feed on abundant larvae of smaller size and have fewer predators themselves. We show how the intensity of cannibalism depends on the temperature dependent growth rate and the resulting relative size distribution when eggs are released continuously over a period of a few weeks. The predator-prey size distribution and the relative densities of these voracious larvae may produce overcompensation in recruitment under some environmental conditions.									34	0	0	0	32	0	34			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000292890400017

An examination of correlations between measures of bird and insect abundance across different spatial scales and over varying time lag effects may provide insight into underlying mechanisms. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to assess correlations between counts of eight warbler species from the Breeding Bird Survey in eastern Canada, 1966 to 2009, with the presence of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) at immediate local scales and time-lagged regional scales, as measured by extent of defoliation on host tree species. Budworm-associated species Cape May warbler (Setophaga tigrina), bay-breasted warbler (Setophaga castanea), and Tennessee warbler (Oreothlypis peregrina) responded strongly and positively to both local and regional effects. In contrast, non-budworm-associated species, Blackburnian warbler (Setophaga fusca), magnolia warbler (Setophaga magnolia), Canada warbler (Cardellina canadensis), black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and black-throated green warbler (Setophaga virens), only responded to regional effects in a manner that varied across eastern Canada. The complex responses by forest birds to insect outbreaks involve both increased numerical responses to food supply and to longer term responses to changes in forest structure and composition. These effects can vary across spatial scales and be captured in hierarchical population models, which can serve to disentangle common trends from data when examining drivers of population dynamics like forest management or climate change.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2045-7758			WOS:000442492100008	30151153

Post mortem studies included pathological, microbiological, and sea urchin species identification procedures.ResultsAll turtles showed severe intestinal impaction caused by large amounts of sea urchins, mainly affecting the colon and the caudal half of the small intestine. Histologically, severe focal fibrinonecrotic enteritis was diagnosed in two turtles. In the remaining turtles, lesions ranged from mild desquamation of the intestinal epithelium to severe congestion of the blood vessels of lamina propria, submucosa, muscular and serosa, and edema. Vibrio sp. was isolated from the spleen and intestinal mucosa of a loggerhead in which focal fibrinonecrotic enteritis had been diagnosed. In five turtles, all the remains were fragments from long-spined sea urchins (Diadema africanum); the last turtle contained a mixture of long-spined sea urchin (90%) and purple sea urchin (Sphaerechinus granularis) (10%) remains.ConclusionsAlthough the prevalence of this cause of stranding was low (< 1.6%) compared to other mortality causes, continued overfishing and anthropogenic climate change could increase its incidence. Intestinal impaction with large amounts of sea urchins should be included in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases in sea turtles, and the possible toxic effect of some sea urchin species on sea turtles should also be investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000485041400072	31442294

J	West, Matt; Todd, Charles R.; Gillespie, Graeme R.; McCarthy, Michael								Title: Recruitment is key to understanding amphibian's different population-level responses to chytrid fungus infection								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				241						108247	10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108247				JAN 2020	2020	Understanding why related species have differing population-level responses to threats can be key to identifying conservation options for declining populations. However, this is difficult when multiple threats are implicated. Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis: Bd) is implicated in at least 500 amphibian population declines globally, although few tangible options exist to mitigate pathogen impacts. Other threatening processes also invariably operate on most amphibians. Non-native fish, for example, can contribute to amphibian declines and may exacerbate Bd impacts. We disentangled the impacts of Bd and non-native fish upon two stream breeding frog species with differing conservation statuses to reveal vital rates that are crucial for species persistence. Litoria spenceri are threatened and historically occurred at elevations between 300-1100 m asl in southeastern Australia. Litoria lesueurii are non-threatened and sympatric with L. spenceri at some sites. Using mark-recapture derived demographic rates known to correlate with climate and elevation, discrete-time deterministic population models were constructed for each species at high, moderate and low elevation sites, and multiple management scenarios. Our study reveals that age to maturation, clutch size and egg-year 1 survival influenced interspecific and intraspecific population-level responses of the two frogs to Bd impacts. Importantly, our results highlight that an amphibian population's capacity to counteract Bd-mediated adult mortality is clearly constrained by other threats and environment interactions that moderate species recruitment. Furthermore, understanding limits to recruitment may help identify Bd mitigation strategies. In our study, disease mitigation may be best achieved at some sites by enhancing recruitment through non-native fish management.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3207	1873-2917		WOS:000518695100038

The growth rate of larvae from first-time and repeat spawners were similar from hatching through to 41 days old, when the experiment was terminated. Larvae from first-time spawners were heavier throughout the experiment than larvae of repeat spawners, a difference that might be explained by a difference (although non-significant) in egg size between the two groups. There was a significant difference in growth rate between the two mesocosms, which may be explained by the difference in temperature between the mesocosms. In both mesocosms larvae fed mainly on copepod nauplii during the first weeks of life and started to actively select copepodites at age 20 days post hatch. There was no significant difference in the energy content of the ingested prey at a given age between offspring of first-time and repeat spawners, although there was a significant difference between the two mesocosms. The dry mass of the ingested prey items compared to larval dry mass increased until age 17-27 days post hatch and decreased thereafter.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			1745-1000			WOS:000265967600006

Generalist predators are suggested to be important in spring before specialist predators become active.Here, we show that some generalist predators are important even during winter, when the majority of arthropod pests and their enemies are dormant. We quantified the role of winter-active generalist predators on the suppression of pear psylla during winter using a discrete nonlinear model of an intraguild predation system.To parameterize our model, we conducted a series of experiments on (i) functional responses, (ii) prey preferences and (iii) ontogenetic development and made observations on the population densities of spiders and potential prey. We ran the model for different winter scenarios, that is, for very cold and very warm winters.Synthesis and applications. We found that winter-active predators considerably suppressed the pear psylla population. Predators exerted a stronger effect in a warmer winter than in a colder one. Orchard growers thus should avoid use of non-selective pesticides during this period and instead aim to support the community of generalist predators. Our results suggest more attention should be given to encouraging generalist predator populations in other systems, even in periods when crops are not producing.We found that winter-active predators considerably suppressed the pear psylla population.

We examined the latitudinal distribution of mesozooplankton and their grazing impacts on phytoplankton in the Amundsen Sea during the early austral summer from December 27, 2010 to January 13, 2011. Mesozooplankton followed a latitudinal distribution in relation to hydrographic and environmental features, with copepods dominating in the oceanic area and euphausiids dominating in the polynya. Greater Euphausia crystallorophias biomass in the polynya was associated with lower salinity and higher food concentration (chlorophyll a, choanoflagellates, and heterotrophic dinoflagellates). The grazing impact of three copepods (Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, and Metridia gerlachei) on phytoplankton was low, with the consumption of 3 % of phytoplankton standing stock and about 4 % of daily primary production. Estimated daily carbon rations for each of the three copepods were also relatively low (< 10 %), barely enough to cover metabolic demands. This suggests that copepods may rely on food other than phytoplankton and that much of the primary production is channeled through microzooplankton. Daily carbon rations for E. crystallorophias were high (up to 49 %) with the grazing impact accounting for 17 % of the phytoplankton biomass and 84 % of primary production. The presence of E. crystallorophias appears to be a critical factor regulating phytoplankton blooms and determining the fate of fixed carbon in the coastal polynyas of the Amundsen Sea.									20	0	0	0	10	1	22			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000321975200012		
J	WAGNER, R								A LABORATORY STUDY ON THE LIFE-CYCLE OF SERICOSTOMA-PERSONATUM (KIRBY AND SPENCE), AND LIGHT DARK-DEPENDENT FOOD-CONSUMPTION								HYDROBIOLOGIA				208	3			201	212		10.1007/BF00007785				DEC 10 1990	1990	The life cycle of Sericostoma personatum (Spence) was studied at 6-degrees-C, 10-degrees-C and 14-degrees-C and at each temperature at 8 and 14 hrs daylength. Embryogenesis was not temperature dependent in the 12-degrees - 18-degrees-C range. Only 7 of 38 (app. 18%) had a direct development, the rest remained in diapause with partly developed larvae. Hatching success of single egg masses was over 95%. At 6-degrees-C at both LDs, about 452 days are required for larval development. At 10-degrees-C 370 days (LD 8/16), or 320 days (LD 14/10) and at 14-degrees-C 319 days (LD 8/16) and 295 days (LD 14/10) were required. Duration of instars III and IV was longer at 6-degrees-C (both LDs), compared with all other groups. Vth instar larvae of the 14-degrees-C (LD 14/10) group grew fastest. Instar VI larvae of the 10-degrees-C short day group developed faster than all others. Instar VII larvae of both 14-degrees-C groups and of the 10-degrees-C long day group develop faster than the rest. Duration of pupal instar is only temperature dependent, regardless of light regime. The field life cycle of S. personatum may require 2-5 years. Larvae are night active. They feed on Coarse Particular Organic Material (CPOM) on the sediment surface at night. They release faeces (Fine Particular Organic Material, FPOM) into the sediment where they rest by day at a few cm depth. Their burrowing behavior thus contributes to the retention of FPOM in the stream channel. Daily food consumption at constant 10-degrees-C is significantly dependent on night length (r2 = 0.979, p < 0.05). Two factors thus may limit food consumption: in winter, low temperatures, and in summer short nights. The species thus avoids competition by day-active shredders and predation by day-active predators.									24	0	0	0	19	1	24			0018-8158			WOS:A1990EX30300006

Previous work on amphibious sea snakes (sea kraits Laticauda spp.) in New Caledonia has documented the former parameters, and suggested that these marine snakes may be major predators within coral-reef ecosystems. To estimate the area over which these snakes forage, we have developed methods based on detailed assessments of (1) the eel species consumed (and, hence, their habitats of origin), (2) the state of digestion (and, hence, time since capture) of prey items inside snakes returning to their home islands after foraging trips, and (3) the rate of digestion of prey in experimental trials. In combination with data on rates of snake movement, we conclude that one species (Laticauda laticaudata) forages mostly on soft-bottom habitats within 23 km of the home island, whereas the other species (L. saintgironsi) forages on coral substrates within 38 km of the home island. The distribution of estimated foraging ranges was similar between these 2 species (about one-third of prey taken within a few kilometres of the home island; the rest from a wide range of much further sites), despite interspecific divergence in traits such as prey types, prey sizes and rates of digestion. These extensive foraging ranges suggest that sea kraits are significant predators of eels over the entire area of the lagoon; and imply that populations of these top predators can be affected by disturbance to prey resources even many kilometres from the home island.									45	1	0	0	45	0	47			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000251948500015

Coral-feeding fishes are negatively affected by coral loss caused by extensive bleaching, but it is unknown how feeding behaviour of most corallivorous fishes changes in response to coral bleaching. In this study, coral bleaching was experimentally induced in situ to examine the feeding response of two obligate corallivorous fish, Labrichthys unilineaturs (Labridae) and Chaetodon baronessa (Chaetodontidae). Feeding rates were monitored before, during, and immediately after experimental bleaching of prey corals. L. unitineatus significantly increased its feeding on impacted corals during bleaching, but showed a steady decline in feeding once corals were fully bleached. Feeding response of L. unilineatus appears to parallel the expected stress-induced mucous production by bleaching colonies. In contrast, C. baronessa preferentially fed from healthy colonies over bleached colonies, although bleached colonies were consumed for five days following manipulation. Feeding by corallivorous fishes can play an important role in determining coral condition and mortality of corals following stress induced bleaching. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we examined the vertical distributions of copepods during spring and summer in the Skagerrak and during autumn in the North Sea with respect to different physiochemical factors including turbulent dissipation rate. The ambush feeder O. similis numerically dominated the copepod community; they were located in the layers with high microzooplankton abundance. M, norwegica were dominant in the Skagerrak and were observed within or just below the pycnocline; they are assumed to feed on sinking detrital aggregates. Both copepods use remote detection of either hydromechanical (O. similis) or chemical signals (M, norwegica) generated by the prey and both species migrated to deeper depths in response to elevated surface turbulence. The potential effect of turbulence on both types of feeding is theoretically shown to be negative and we suggest a turbulent dissipation rate in the range 10(-7) to 10(-6) m(2) s(-3) as a threshold triggering the observed avoidance responses.									26	0	0	0	22	0	27			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000238837300014

The main objective was to investigate local adaptations to hydrographic conditions with low temperatures and salinities with consequences for culture policies. In laboratory experiments, mortality increased at lower temperatures except at salinities below 18%. Highest mortality was found in combinations of very low salinities and the high temperature treatment (10 degreesC). Feeding activity, measured as fecal production, was significantly lower in 5 compared to 10 degreesC. Feeding rate began to decline at 18 parts per thousand and ceased at 16 parts per thousand . The time to recover feeding activity depended upon the duration of low-salinity exposure. Spat exposed to salinities below 16 parts per thousand did not regain their feeding activity when returned to full salinity, indicating permanent damage. Increased exposure time also lead to higher mortality after the return to full salinity. Comparison between rapid and gradual change of salinity indicates a potential for acclimation. In a model forced by field data on temperature and salinities, survival trajectories were calculated for different water depth and for different seasons. The model predictions were rested in a field experiment where the model could explain winter and spring mortalities in terms of temperature and salinity. In the summer, however, the model underestimates mortality, indicating the importance of such other sources of mortality as fouling and predation. To minimize mortality, this study suggests that culture policies should include deployment below 6 m with initial transfer of spat to the sea at midsummer.									14	1	0	0	11	0	15			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000166380100014

Effect of temperature on the larval stage of Tetanocera elata (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) - Potential biological control agent of pestiferous slugs								BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				74				45	51		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.03.005				JUL 2014	2014	Due to the considerable losses caused by slugs in terms of agricultural production and revenue, there is an urgent need for a cost effective biological control agent. The malacophagous nature of the sciomyzid fly, Tetanocera elata (Fab.) makes it a possible contender to meet this demand. This study examined the effect of constant temperatures (14, 17, 20, 23, and 26 degrees C), in addition to ambient outdoor and laboratory temperatures on T. elata larval duration and predation. In general, the mean and median larval stage duration decreased as temperature increased with percentage survival for the overall larval stage (62%) greatest at 20 degrees C with a median duration of 44 days. There was no significant difference between temperatures with regard to the number of slugs killed per larva and while predation rate increased with increasing constant temperature, there was also no significant difference between the constant temperatures. Our results show that puparial weight can be used to predict the sex of adult flies prior to their emergence. The results are discussed in the context of the suitability of T. elata as a biological control agent of pestiferous slugs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

One ecosystem property is the body size of the animals living in the system, which is assumed to depend on temperature or resource availability, among others. For primary consumers, resource availability may directly be related to plant traits, while for secondary consumers the relationship is indirect. We used plant traits to describe resource availability along an elevational gradient on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Using structural equation models, we determined the response of plant traits to changes in precipitation, temperature and disturbance with and assessed whether abiotic conditions or community-weighted means of plant traits are stronger predictors of the mean size of bees, moths, frugivorous birds, and insectivorous birds. Traits indicating tissue density and nutrient content strongly responded to variations in precipitation, temperature and disturbance. They had direct effects on pollination and fruit traits. However, the average body sizes of the animal groups considered could only be explained by temperature and habitat structure, not by plant traits. Our results demonstrate a strong link between traits and the abiotic environment, but suggest that temperature is the most relevant predictor of mean animal body size. Community-weighted means of plant traits and body sizes appear unsuitable to capture the complexity of plant-animal interactions.									6	1	0	0	6	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000398945800054	28319155

We evaluated the short-term resilience (a resistance to change or a rapid return to pre-storm conditions) of tidal marshes on Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey by comparing vegetation cover/composition, meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) relative abundance, and predation rates on artificial bird nests, from three to six months pre-hurricane with seven to 11 months post-hurricane. These three metrics show a high degree of resilience to Hurricane Sandy. Vegetation cover/composition remained similar pre- and post-hurricane, except for five site-specific changes. Although meadow voles were significantly less abundant following the hurricane, we detected a rapid increase from June to July 2013, indicating resiliency via rapid recovery in the population. We also did not observe widespread changes in nest predation rates on artificial nests. Our findings indicate that management actions intended to recover vegetation, small mammals, and nest predators following a large hurricane disturbance may be of less importance than long-term strategies to avoid gradual changes that can reduce ecosystem resilience.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0277-5212	1943-6246		WOS:000437409800013

Our analysis identified Brachionus calyciflorus as the preferred prey for A. brightwellii based on life table statistics, ingestion rate and electivity indices. The greatest values for net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate were achieved when A. brightwellii was fed B. calyciflorus. Greater reproductive values (R (o) and r) were found at 25A degrees C than at 20A degrees C for A. brightwellii across the five prey species. We found significant differences in the ingestion rate and electivity index among zooplanktonic and benthic preys. The influence of temperature, the cost of predation, and how prey selection by A. brightwellii is influenced by: biomass, size, and swimming speed; they are discussed hoping to gain a better understanding of trophic transfers in zooplankton communities.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000403357600014

Competitive release modifies the impacts of hydrologic alteration for a partially migratory stream predator								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				24	2			276	292		10.1111/eff.12145				APR 2015	2015	Understanding ecological effects of altered stream flows is an essential objective. In a comparative field study of juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that compared natural- and reduced-flow sites, we used mark-recapture modelling and information theory to quantify spatially and temporally explicit patterns of density, specific growth rate, survival and outmigration; and test predictions for biotic and abiotic drivers. Densities were lower in water withdrawal treatments, resulting in lower intraspecific competition and, higher specific growth rate and survival. We observed yearly differences in density and intraspecific competition, with a negative relationship between density and specific growth rate over a wide range of densities, but reductions in survival only at the highest densities. Moreover, individual variability within sites was important. At high density (sites and years), survival related negatively to body size. In contrast, when overall density was lower, specific growth rate was negatively related to body size. Lastly, individuals were more likely to outmigrate when they had larger body size, lower survival or reared in habitats with reduced flows, and these patterns appeared mediated by the intensity of intraspecific competition. Our results underscore the harsh bioenergetic conditions induced by higher temperatures and densities during summer baseflow (relative to other seasons), particularly for larger fish demanding more resources, and suggest a density-dependent mechanism for why this period is important for regulating salmonid populations. We found that a complex combination of natural (e.g., density) and anthropogenic (e.g., withdrawal) factors affected juvenile salmon populations and life history expression in the face of altered flows.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000351349400011

Social wasp Polybia ignobilis (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is found in South America and Ascia monuste orseis (Godart) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) is an important Brassica pest in the Americas. Although the importance of predatory Vespidae is acknowledged, little is known about their activity as agents of biological control of insects. For this reason, this research aimed to study the natural biological control of A. monuste caterpillars by P ignobilis and focused on the importance of P ignobilis as a predator of A. monuste caterpillars. It also investigated the influence of weather on P ignobilis foraging activity and the mechanisms that govern its predatory behavior. The main predator of A. monuste caterpillars was social wasp P ignobilis, which predated caterpillars from the second to the fifth instar. More intense predatory activity by P ignobilis occurred in periods of higher temperature (up to 29 degrees C) and maximum sunlight (around 5:30 h after sunrise). P ignobilis foraging was not observed when rain or strong winds occurred. Predation of A. monuste caterpillars by P ignobilis is complex and comprises three behavioral mechanisms.									27	0	0	0	13	1	27			0361-6525			WOS:000279233700006

For example, in coral reef ecosystems, outbreaks of coral predators like crown-of-thorns sea stars have been associated with fishing pressure and can dramatically impact the composition and persistence of corals. However, the ecological impacts, and consequences for management, of smaller, less obvious corallivores remain inadequately understood. We investigated whether reef state (coral vs. seaweed domination) influenced densities and size frequencies of the corallivorous gastropod Coralliophila violacea on its common host, the coral Porites cylindrica, within three pairs of small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and adjacent fished areas in Fiji. C. violacea densities were 5-35 times greater, and their size frequencies more broadly distributed, within seaweed-dominated fished areas than in adjacent MPAs dominated by corals. Tethering snails (4-9 mm in shell height) in place on their coral hosts indicated that suppression of snails in MPAs was due to predation, apparently by fishes. When tethered on the benthos (where they rarely occur), rather than on their host, mortality of larger snails (15.0-25.0 mm in shell height) was high in all areas, primarily due to hermit crabs killing them and occupying their shells. Because C. violacea is a sessile gastropod that feeds affixed to the base of corals and produces minimal visible damage, it has been considered a "prudent feeder" that minimally impacts its host coral. We assessed this over a 24-d feeding period in the field. Feeding by individual C. violacea reduced P. cylindrica growth by similar to 18-43% depending on snail size. Our findings highlight the considerable, but underappreciated, negative impacts of this common corallivore on degraded reefs. As reefs degrade and corals are lost, remaining corals (often species of Porites) may gain the full attention of elevated densities of coral consumers. This will further damage the remaining foundation species, suppressing the resilience of corals and enhancing the resilience of degraded, seaweed-dominated reefs.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000446009900001	30048025

Microzooplankton grazing increased with increasing of temperature. Grazing rate was maximum levels in spring and summer. Microphytoplankton, which dominated the total algal biomass and production, were characterized by the proliferation of several chain-forming diatoms. Small heterotrophic flagellates and aloricate ciliates were the main controllers of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton represented a significant for micrograzers, which grazing represented 20-120% of diatom and cynabacteria algal production during 2006-2007. Microzooplankton has, however, a relatively high impact on microphytoplankton, as > 45% of microalgal production was consumed throughout the year. These results suggest that the low grazing was one of the factors contributing to the development of the spring bloom. All of seasonal bases, the phytoplankton production were grazed by microzooplankton in summer, autumn and winter-spring seasons have been changing between 20%-120%. The seasonal variation in the microzooplankton grazing pressure seems to result from the dominant size class of the phytoplankton community of this lagoon diatom and cynabacteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1562-2916			WOS:000314453500009		
J	Nogueira, Adriana; Tolimieri, Nick; Gonzalez-Troncoso, Diana				Gonzalez-Troncoso, Diana/AAA-6727-2019				Using multivariate state-space models to examine commercial stocks of redfish (Sebastes spp.) on the Flemish Cap								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				76	2			208	216		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0435				FEB 2019	2019	There are three different species of redfish (Sebastes spp.) in the waters of the Flemish Cap (Division 3M, NAFO Regulatory Area): S. fasciatus, S. mentella, and S. norvegicus. Historically, S. fasciatus and S. mentella have been managed together as a single stock because of similar biology and difficulty in species identification. Here we use multivariate autoregressive state-space models to examine the abundance trajectories of the three species and to determine whether they can be treated as a single stock for management purposes or whether they should be treaty separately. We also included covariates to evaluate relationships with climate, commercial catch, and the abundance of predators and (or) competitors and prey. We did two separate analyses: (i) a single-period analysis over the full time series and (ii) a blocked, two-period analysis over different regulatory periods. In both analyses, the best-fit model included separate trajectories for each species at each depth but one overall stock growth rate; both also included commercial catches as a covariate. These analyses suggest that a single assessment for the Sebastes complex is acceptable.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000456966600003

Various commercial feeds are used for muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) and tiger muskellunge (E. masquinongy X E. lucius), but no data are available that compare growth and survival of these two fishes on these diets. Growth and survival were evaluated over 8 weeks for both muskellunge (initial mean total length, 172 mm) and tiger musckellunge (187 mm) fed four commercially available feeds: Biodiet Grower, Biodry 1000, Abernathy S8-2 (84), and W-16. Across all diets, tiger muskellunge grew more than 1.5 times as fast as muskellunge. Both muskellunge and tiger muskellunge grew faster on three diets developed for coldwater species (Biodiet, Biodry, and Abernathy), than on the one developed for coolwater species (W-16). Muskellunge also grew faster when fed Biodiet or Biodry than when fed Abernathy. Differences in growth may be related to dietary protein levels. Body composition was affected by diet; percent fat was highest for both species fed Biodry, and protein levels were higher for tiger muskellunge fed Biodiet or Abernathy. Survival was high and was not affected by diet type for either species. Based on growth rates, body composition, and feed cost, we recommend Biodiet or Biodry as a diet for muskellunge and Biodry or Abernathy for tiger muskellunge.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0033-0779			WOS:A1995QG59200004

Yet the timing of snowmelt is advancing in the Arctic, which may allow some species to produce an additional clutch. To determine if this is already happening, we used specimens of the wolf spiderPardosa glacialiscaught by pitfall traps from the long-term (1996-2014) monitoring programme at Zackenberg, NE Greenland. We dissected individual egg sacs and counted the number of eggs and partially developed juveniles, and measured carapace width of the mothers. Upon the discovery of a bimodal frequency distribution of clutch sizes, as is typical for wolf spiders at lower latitudes producing a second clutch, we assigned egg sacs to being a first or second clutch depending on clutch size. We tested whether the median capture date differed among first and second clutches, whether clutch size was correlated to female size, and whether the proportion of second clutches produced within a season was related to climate. We found that assigned second clutches appeared significantly later in the season than first clutches. In years with earlier snowmelt, first clutches occurred earlier and the proportion of second clutches produced was larger. Likely, females produce their first clutch earlier in those years which allow them time to produce another clutch. Clutch size for first clutches was correlated to female size, while this was not the case for second clutches. Our results provide the first evidence for Arctic invertebrates producing additional clutches in response to warming. This could be a common but overlooked phenomenon due to the challenges associated with long-term collection of life-history data in the Arctic. Moreover, given that wolf spiders are a widely distributed, important tundra predator, we may expect to see population and food web consequences of their increased reproductive rates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000545646000005	32576114

Depensatory Mortality, Density-Dependent Growth, and Delayed Compensation: Disentangling the Interplay of Mortality, Growth, and Density during Early Life Stages of Yellow Perch								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				138	1			99	110		10.1577/T07-256.1				JAN 2009	2009	We present long-term (>40-year) patterns in the density of age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens in Oneida Lake at four early life stages (at egg deposition, at the attainment of a total length of 18 mm. on I August, and on 15 October), front which we calculated mortality and growth rates during the three intervals between these early life stages. At each of these stages. age-0 yellow perch densities have been lower in recent years than in the 1960s and 1970s. Mortality rates showed no time trend front egg to 18 nun (interval I [the larval stage]), increased from 18 turn to I August (interval 2 [the limnetic stage]), and decreased front I August to 15 October (interval 3 [the demersal stage]). We also tested previous hypotheses for density-dependent effects on mortality and growth using the entire long-term data set, Contrary to expectations from the 1960s, the mortality rates of age-0 yellow perch in Oneida Lake are no longer depensatory. Overall, the growth rate of age-0 yellow perch has increased over time and become density dependent. Also contrary to common expectations of size-selective mortality, greater average total length is not associated with decreased instantaneous daily mortality fer two early life stage intervals. The combined effect has been a decline in age-0 yellow perch density and in increase in average total length by the end of their first year. Although increased growth has not sufficiently compensated for increased mortality during the first year of life, obtaining a larger end-of-year size should reduce subsequent mortality during the winter period, providing for it process of delayed compensation that helps stabilize density at age 1.									42	0	1	0	42	0	44			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000268500900009

This question motivated an experimental study on rock sandpipers (Calidris ptilocnemis). The species' nonbreeding range spans 20 deg of latitude, the extremes of which are inhabited by two subspecies: C. p. ptilocnemis that winters primarily in upper Cook Inlet, Alaska (61 degrees N) and C. p. tschuktschorum that overlaps slightly with C. p. ptilocnemis but whose range extends much farther south (similar to 40 degrees N). In view of the strongly contrasting energetic demands of their distinct nonbreeding distributions, we conducted experiments to assess the behavioral, physiological and sensory aspects of foraging and we used the bivalve Macoma balthica for all trials. C. p. ptilocnemis consumed a wider range of prey sizes, had higher maximum rates of energy intake, processed shell waste at higher maximum rates and handled prey more quickly. Notably, however, the two subspecies did not differ in their abilities to find buried prey. The subspecies were similar in size and had equally sized gizzards, but the more northern ptilocnemis individuals were 10-14% heavier than their same-sex tschuktschorum counterparts. The higher body mass in ptilocnemis probably resulted from hypertrophy of digestive organs (e.g. intestine, liver) related to digestion and nutrient assimilation. Given the previously established equality of the metabolic capacities of the two subspecies, we propose that the high-latitude nonbreeding range of ptilocnemis rock sandpipers is primarily facilitated by digestive (i.e. physiological) aspects of their foraging ecology rather than behavioral or sensory aspects.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000354114900014	25714569

Sars, Eucyclops neumani Pesta, Macrocyclops albidus Jurine, Mesocyclops longisetus Thibaud, Metacyclops grandis Kiefer and Metacyclops mendocinus Wierzejski (Copepoda: Cyclopidae) on mosquito larvae, Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) were assessed. Experiments consisted of 24-h incubations of one copepod and 10 larvae without extra food at 16degreesC and 26degreesC. Nine replicates were considered for each species and temperature. Predation rates (larvae per copepod per day) were: M. mendocinus (1.8), M. grandis (3.1), E. neumani (3.8), A. robustus (3.8), Ma. albidus (6.1) and Me. longisetus (7.0). There was a significant effect of both species and temperature on predation: all species experienced higher predation at 26degreesC than at 16degreesC, except for A. robustus whose predation rate was similar at both temperatures. These observations are consistent with previous results that point to Macrocyclops and Mesocyclops genera as important larval predators and suggest the need for field trials to evaluate the response of Ma. albidus and Me. longisetus under natural conditions in Uruguay.									14	0	0	0	11	1	14			0269-283X			WOS:000185088600015	12941020

Dam construction, habitat degradation, and altered flow regimes have all contributed to depress populations, which currently persist in only a few tributaries to the Sacramento River. Mill Creek (Tehama County) continues to support these threatened fish, and contains some of the most pristine spawning and rearing habitat available in the Central Valley. Despite this pristine habitat, the number of Chinook salmon returning to spawn has declined to record low numbers, likely due to poor outmigration survival rates. From 2013 to 2017, 334 smolts were captured and acoustic tagged while out-migrating from Mill Creek, allowing for movement and survival rates to be tracked over 250 km through the Sacramento River. During this study California experienced both a historic drought and record rainfall, resulting in dramatic fluctuations in year-to-year river flow and water temperature. Cumulative survival of tagged smolts from Mill Creek through the Sacramento River was 9.5% (+/- 1.6) during the study, with relatively low survival during historic drought conditions in 2015 (4.9% +/- 1.6) followed by increased survival during high flows in 2017 (42.3% +/- 9.1). Survival in Mill Creek and the Sacramento River was modeled over a range of flow values, which indicated that higher flows in each region result in increased survival rates. Survival estimates gathered in this study can help focus management and restoration actions over a relatively long migration corridor to specific regions of low survival, and provide guidance for management actions in the Sacramento River aimed at restoring populations of threatened Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000525756000001		
J	Trussell, GC				Trussell, Geoffrey/AAQ-9165-2020				Evidence of countergradient variation in the growth of an intertidal snail in response to water velocity								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				243				123	131		10.3354/meps243123				2002	2002	Growth rates in rocky intertidal snails can vary considerably across wave exposure gradients, and have both plastic and genetic bases. However, little is known regarding whether genetic and environmental influences on variation in growth act in the same (cogradient) or in an opposing (countergradient) direction. Determining how genetic and environmental influences on growth covary with one another may improve our understanding of how habitat-specific variation in growth emerges. This study utilized laboratory flumes to examine the effects of high and low water velocities on the growth of intertidal snails Littorina obtusata from a wave-exposed and a sheltered shore. Both flow velocity and source population significantly influenced all measures of growth (shell length, shell thickness, shell mass and tissue mass). Snails from both populations exhibited greater growth in low versus high flow velocity. In addition, snails from the wave-exposed population grew more than snails from the sheltered population regardless of flow treatment. This result yielded a pattern of countergradient variation in growth and suggests that genetic differentiation between the 2 populations was responsible for the more rapid growth of wave-exposed snails. This greater growth potential of wave-exposed snails was particularly evident when they were raised in an environment conducive to rapid growth (i.e. low flow velocity). Most examples of countergradient variation in the growth of intertidal gastropods have involved temperature effects on latitudinally separated populations. This study provides evidence that countergradient variation in growth can occur on localized spatial scales in response to environmental cues other than temperature. On rocky intertidal shores, countergradient variation in growth may reflect selection for fast-growing genotypes to offset limitations on foraging time imposed by increased hydrodynamic stress on wave-exposed shores.									29	0	0	0	29	0	30			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000179689200011

CRUSTACEANA				88	7-8			839	856		10.1163/15685403-00003447				JUL 2015	2015	Kelp habitats are in decline in many temperate coastal regions of the world due to climate change and expansion of populations of grazing urchins. The loss of kelp habitat may influence the vulnerability to predators of the juveniles of commercially important species. In this study relative predation rates for kelp versus barren reef habitat were measured for early juvenile Australasian spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii (Hutton, 1875), on the northeastern coast of New Zealand using tethering methods. Variation in assemblages of predators over small spatial scales appeared to be more important for determining the relative predation of lobsters, regardless of habitat type. Therefore, the assessment of relative predation risk to early juvenile lobsters between kelp and barren habitats will require more extensive sampling at a small spatial scale, as well as a specific focus on sampling during crepuscular and nocturnal periods when these lobsters are most at risk of predation.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0011-216X	1568-5403		WOS:000362141200006

We examined six factors that may affect survival of small walleye fingerlings (25-50 mm total length) stocked into two large Missouri reservoirs; (1) initial health of stocked fish, (2) handling and transportation stress, (3) water temperature in transport and receiving waters, (4) prey abundance in receiving waters, (5) losses from predation, and (6) growth of stocked fish. Fingerlings were marked with oxytetracycline hydrochloride and stocked into Smithville and Stockton lakes in alternate years from 1998 to 2006, usually at a rate of 70-80 fish/ha. None of the measured survival factors was related to a relative survival index (ratio of the number of age-0 captured/h of October electrofishing to the number stocked/ha). We also assessed whether stockings increased age-0 and adult. abundance and angler catch and harvest of walleyes. For stocking years, the majority of age-0 walleyes collected in October originated from stocking for both Smitliville (63-100% marked, mean = 91%) and Stockton (62-100% marked, mean = 88%) lakes. Electrofishing catch of age-0 walleyes in October was higher in stocking than in nonstocking years. Following stocking, adult abundance and angler catch and harvest of walleyes increased. Fingerling stockings improved the sport fishery for walleyes in both lakes. However, stocking will have to continue to maintain the fisheries because natural recruitment of walleyes did not increase as a result of increased adult abundance.					4th North American Reservoir Symposium on Balancing Fisheries Management and Water Uses for Impounded River Systems4th North American Reservoir Symposium on Balancing Fisheries Management and Water Uses for Impounded River Systems	JUN 07-09, 2007JUN 07-09, 2007	Amer Fisheries Soc, SE Div Reservoir CommAmer Fisheries Soc, SE Div Reservoir Comm	Atlanta, GAAtlanta, GA	3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6	WOS:000263597300025

When exposed to colder temperatures, ectotherms develop more slowly, but mature at larger body sizes and vice versa at higher temperatures. We investigated whether a phytoseiid predatory mite can obtain a larger body size by rearing it at a low temperature and how the increased body size affected predatory performance on its natural prey. Therefore, we allowed the predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to develop at either 15 or 25 degrees C. RESULTS A. limonicus reared at 15 degrees C had a 6% larger body size than those reared at 25 degrees C. Larger predators showed higher predation rates on first instars of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), with 9.6 instars/female/day and 8.5 instars/female/day, for larger and standard-sized females, respectively. After three generations reared at 15 degrees C, body size did not increase any further. When reared for five generations at 15 degrees C, larger A. limonicus females demonstrated a better ability to subdue second-instar F. occidentalis. CONCLUSION Low juvenile rearing temperatures may result in phytoseiid predators with a predator/prey size benefit that could improve their biological control function.

The model includes many natural complexities in habitat (spatial and temporal variation in characteristics such as depth and velocity, temperature, hiding and feeding cover, drift-food supply and predation risk), fish physiology (especially, how food intake and growth vary with hydrodynamics, cover, fish size and temperature) and behaviour. When drift-food concentration was increased over a wide range in 7 year simulations, the simulated population was always food limited. In fact, as food supply increased, the population increased at an increasing rate and consumed a higher percentage of the food supply, apparently because higher food concentrations make more stream area energetically profitable for drift feeders. The behaviour most responsible for this response was activity selection: when food was abundant, fish chose to feed less frequently and more nocturnally, thereby reducing predation mortality so more fish survived longer. These results indicate that the traditional concept of food limitation, that food availability stops limiting population size when it exceeds some threshold level, may not be useful and can be misleading. Results also strongly contradict the concept that a salmonid population is not food limited if the total food supply is greater than the population's consumption. Explicit consideration of adaptive behaviour produced a novel but believable understanding of food effects on salmonid populations. Published 2011.

We assessed charr diets, parasites, growth, maturity, and stable isotope ratios in Fennoscandian subarctic lakes dominated by monomorphic or polymorphic whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) populations. Charr density was low in all lakes, except in profundal habitats. Charr shifted to piscivory at small size (16-25 cm total length) and consumed a range of prey-fish sizes (2-25 cm). Cannibalism was observed in a few individuals from one monomorphic whitefish lake. Charr matured at 37-51 cm (5-8 years old), grew to 52-74 cm maximum observed length and 47-83 cm asymptotic length. Charr increased total area of convex hull and core stable isotopic diversity area of the fish community by 51-98% and 44-51% in monomorphic whitefish lakes, but only 8-11% and 7-10% in polymorphic whitefish lakes. The difference was due to increasing food-chain length in monomorphic whitefish lakes, whereas reliance on littoral carbon did not change. Charr were the top piscivores in monomorphic whitefish lakes, but played a less important role in polymorphic whitefish lakes, which contained a more diverse predator fauna.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000479052700018

Yet, the relative contribution of bottom- up and top-down forces remains poorly understood. We also lack knowledge on the effect of abiotic constraints such as summer drought on the strength and direction of these effects. We measured leaf damage on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), alone or associated with birch, pine or both in a long-term tree diversity experiment (ORPHEE), where half of the plots were irrigated while the other half remained without irrigation and received only rainfall. We tested three mechanisms likely to explain the effects of oak neighbors on herbivory: (1) Direct bottom-up effects of heterospecific neighbors on oak accessibility to herbivores, (2) indirect bottom-up effects of neighbors on the expression of leaf traits, and (3) top-down control of herbivores by predators. Insect herbivory increased during the growth season but was independent of neighbor identity and irrigation. Specific leaf area, leaf toughness, and thickness varied with neighbor identity while leaf dry matter content or C: N ratio did not. When summarized in a principal component analysis (PCA), neighbor identity explained 87% of variability in leaf traits. PCA axes partially predicted herbivory. Despite greater rates of attack on dummy caterpillars in irrigated plots, avian predation, and insect herbivory remained unrelated. Our study suggests that neighbor identity can indirectly influence insect herbivory in mixed forests by modifying leaf traits. However, we found only partial evidence for these trait--mediated effects and suggest that more attention should be paid to some unmeasured plant traits such as secondary metabolites, including volatile organic compounds, to better anticipate the effects of climate change on plant-insect interactions in the future.									20	0	0	0	17	1	20			2045-7758			WOS:000402554700021	28515887

Satellite monitoring is revealing how cyclic and quasi-cyclic climatic patterns, like the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, are driving and synchronising these weather-driven changes in the supplies of food. Changes in the amount of food available operate to limit the abundance of populations largely through their influence on the survival of the very young: the Achilles heel of all populations.Any individual organism struggles to use whatever resources it can get from a mostly inhospitable environment to maximise the proliferation of its genes. Each level of a food chain is thus dependent upon, and pressing hard against the limits set by the one below. The resulting intra- and inter-specific interactions produce a multitude of complex outcomes, that significantly influence the dynamics of populations, but do not determine their ultimate size. There is no density-dependent regulation of abundance. Intra-specific competition does not determine the size of populations, it only decides which few individuals gain access to the limited food. Nor do predators regulate their prey. They, too, are limited by their food, and the abundance and quality of food is dictated by the weather.									153	5	1	0	139	1	157			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000257796900001	18557977

Comparative dietary ecology of turtles (Chelodina burrungandjii and Emydura victoriae) across the Kimberley Plateau, Western Australia, prior to the arrival of cane toads								MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				67	11			1611	1624		10.1071/MF15199				2016	2016	Food webs in north-western Australian rivers exist in dynamic environments and will be influenced by land use practices, invasion of toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina) and the effects of climate change on river flows. Baseline studies are needed to understand aquatic food webs before these impacts. In the present study, we investigated the diets of two turtles (Emydura victoriae and Chelodina burrungandjii) in four upland rivers across a gradient of rainfall and land uses in the Kimberley Plateau of Western Australia. We captured turtles by snorkelling and recovered their prey by stomach lavage. We enumerated 2720 prey items from 390 E. victoriae samples and 308 prey items from 155 C. burrungandjii samples. Prey compositions distinguished E. victoriae as an omnivorous generalist relying on a diversity of animal and plant prey and C. burrungandjii as a piscivorous specialist, but with both species as likely predators of toxic cane toad eggs or tadpoles. Comparisons among the rivers showed variation in diets for both species that reflect differences in prey availability and location-specific food webs. Terrestrially based food sources were observed in 26% of E. victoriae samples and 3% of C. burrungandjii samples, which indicates the importance of the aquatic-terrestrial interface and land use practices within these rivers.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000387256400002

The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) is a migratory species that is occasionally taken as bycatch when targeting gummy shark, and the stock is currently managed under a rebuilding strategy. We used pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) to investigate the survival, movements, and habitat use of mature female school shark (147-170 cm total length) following capture and release from demersal automatic longlines. Satellite telemetry data indicated lively school sharks survived the capture, on-board handling, tagging and release processes. Tracked school sharks mostly moved offshore and across the continental shelf in south to south-easterly directions. Depth habitat use reflected semi-pelagic behavioural traits and a preference for lower mixed layer depths of 50-100 m where water temperatures were 15-21 C. Two PSATs provided data that we interpreted as indicative of tag and/or tagged shark ingestion, and tag regurgitation by endothermic predators. This study also identified an area where neonate and large, mature female school sharks were observed together during the Austral summer. Findings of this study are crucial to informing current fisheries management, stock recovery and bycatch mitigation strategies off southern Australia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Diagnosis can analyse how the environment is influencing the vital rates of this organism. In the present study, we tried to improve the diagnosis of a critically endangered seabird, the Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus, through analysis of the spatio-temporal variability of breeding performance, using long-term data sets covering most of its breeding range. We also analysed the potential influence of 2 food resources, namely small pelagic fish and trawling discards, as measured by purse-seine and trawling landings, respectively. We found inter-annual variability in breeding performance, which could be related to the changes in the availability of both small pelagic fish and trawling discards. Results showed that these variations affected all study colonies in a similar way, thus supporting previous investigations that identified a major foraging area for the whole breeding population. A fitness landscape suggested that current values of breeding success are not responsible for the sharp decline of the species, although incoming fisheries policies could affect its breeding performance in the long term. Factors affecting adult survival, both at sea and in colonies, remain the most important threat, and conservation efforts should concentrate on these issues to prevent the extinction of this endemic species of the Mediterranean region.									29	0	0	0	31	0	32			0171-8630			WOS:000240370000022

Nonetheless, sprat feeding behaviour and daily ration (DR) estimation are usually based on daytime stomach contents from deeper layers. Our study provides a new approach for DR estimation, taking into consideration the DVM associated feeding periodicity. We analysed sprat DVM by hydroacoustics and collected stomach contents in the Central Baltic Sea at different depths. The main outcome is that feeding in the deep during the day represents only 16-39% of the DR. DRs were 1.4-times higher using our approach compared to the established approach. The underestimation by the established approach was mainly caused by ignoring the effect of higher temperatures from the upper layers on the gastric evacuation rate. Our results have major implications not only for DR estimates but also on the interpretation of prey selectivity. The study emphasizes the importance of adapting the sampling design to the vertical feeding dynamics to avoid a biased picture of predator prey interactions.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of different temperatures on nymphal development of Orius thyestes Herring when fed with Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) eggs in climatic chambers at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 and 31 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 10% RH and 12h photophase. The thermal requirements and nymphal consumption were also determined. O. thyestes presented five instars. The nymphal period was about six times shorter at 31 degrees C (9.8 days) than at 16 degrees C (58.2 days). Nymph survival was lowest at 16 degrees C, with only 40% of the nymphs reaching adult stage. The higher nymph survival were found at 22 degrees C (96.4%), 25 degrees C (94.5%) and 28 degrees C (100%). Each nymph of O. thyestes consumed 39.4 eggs of A. kuehniella. The lower temperature threshold and thermal constant for the nymphal development of O. thyestes were 12.8 degrees C and 173.82 day-degrees, respectively. The interval from 22 degrees C to 28 degrees C is more suitable for nymphal development of O. thyestes. O. thyestes finds probably better chance for colonization and establishment in tropical and subtropical regions.									2	0	0	0	3	1	3			1519-566X	1678-8052		WOS:000231778900011		
J	ZWARTS, L; WANINK, JH								HOW THE FOOD-SUPPLY HARVESTABLE BY WADERS IN THE WADDEN SEA DEPENDS ON THE VARIATION IN ENERGY DENSITY, BODY-WEIGHT, BIOMASS, BURYING DEPTH AND BEHAVIOR OF TIDAL-FLAT INVERTEBRATES								NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				31	4			441	476		10.1016/0077-7579(93)90059-2				DEC 1993	1993	For several reasons, waders in the Wadden Sea face a large seasonal and annual variation in their food supply. Observations on a tidal flat in the Dutch Wadden Sea have shown that: (1) The average energy density of ten invertebrate prey species varies between 21 and 23 kJ.g-1 AFDW. In Scrobicularia plana and Mya arenaria, but not in Macoma balthica, the energy density is 10% lower in winter than in summer. (2) Depending on the species, body weights of prey of similar size are 30 to 60% lower in winter than in summer. (3) The year-to-year fluctuation in standing-crop biomass is larger in some species than in others, the difference depending mainly on the frequency of successful recruitment. The overall biomass of the macrobenthos in winter is half of that in summer, but the timing of the peak biomass differs per species. (4) The burying depth varies per species: Cerastoderma edule live just beneath the surface, while M. balthica, S. plana, M. arenaria, Arenicola marina and Nereis diversicolor bury more deeply and the majority of these prey live out of reach of the bird's bill. In all six species, burying depth increases with size. There is no seasonal variation in depth of C. edule and M. arenaria, but the four other species live at most shallow depth in early summer and most deeply in midwinter. Burying depths in winter vary from year to year, but are unrelated to temperature. Neither has temperature any effect on depth within months. For knot Calidris canutus feeding on M. balthica, the fluctuation in the accessible fraction was the main source of variation in the biomass of prey that is actually harvestable, i.e. the biomass of prey of suitable size that is accessible.Accordingly, the paper reviews the available data on the temporal variations in accessibility, detectability, ingestibility, digestibility and profitability of prey for waders. Only a small part of the prey is harvestable since many accessible prey are ignored because of their low profitability, while many profitable prey are inaccessible. The profitability of prey depends on their size and weight but also on their depth in the mud, since handling time increases with burying depth. A simple biomechanical rule explains why the handling time of small prey increases with bill length and why large, long-billed waders ignore a disproportionately larger part of the small prey. The fraction detectable for visually feeding waders is usually very low, especially when the temperature of the substrate is below 3-6-degrees-C. Waders vary their prey choice over the year in response to the changes in the availability and profitability of their different prey species. The food supply harvestable by waders is much lower in winter than in summer. For waders wintering in the Wadden Sea, the food supply may be characterized as unpredictable and usually meagre. Waders wintering in NW Europe are concentrated in coastal sites where the average surface temperature is above 3-degrees-C. This probably cannot be explained by a greater burying depth, and only partly by a lower body condition, of prey in colder areas. Yet the harvestable fraction is lower in colder sites, especially for sight-feeding waders, as invertebrates are less active at low temperatures. However, the lower energetic cost of living and reduced chances of the prey being covered by ice may also contribute to the waders' preference for warmer sites.									247	0	0	0	213	0	253			0077-7579			WOS:A1993NC79400012		
J	Morris, Gail; Conner, L. Mike								Effects of forest management practices, weather, and indices of nest predator abundance on nest predation: A 12-year artificial nest study								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				366				23	31		10.1016/j.foreco.2016.02.006				APR 15 2016	2016	Nest predation is often the primary cause of avian nest failure, and factors influencing nest predation are diverse. To better understand how forest management practices, weather, and indices of nest predator abundance influence nest predation, we set artificial ground nests at 100 sites for 2 weeks each summer from 2002 to 2013 in a longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem. We modeled effects of prescribed fire, hardwood removal, rainfall, temperature, indices of mammalian and avian nest predator abundance, and proximity to wildlife food plots and agriculture, edges, and roads on nest predation. Annual nest predation rates ranged from 30% to 74% and averaged 53%. Occurrence of prescribed fire at a nest site <2 months prior to nest placement had a strong, positive association with nest predation but prescribed fires carried out >2 months prior to nest placement had little effect. Hardwood removal was also associated with increased rates of nest predation, but this effect appeared most prevalent 4-9 years following removals. Nest predation rates also increased when food plots or agricultural fields were within 50 m of nest sites. Higher temperatures were associated with greater rates of predation, but rainfall did not have a significant influence. There was a general lack of support for effects of predator indices on nest predation rates, except for a weak, negative association with raccoon relative abundance. This study shows the wide range of factors which may influence nest predation and importance of viewing effects of forest management practices on nest predation over the long term.

J	Alonzo, F; Mayzaud, P; Razouls, S; Bocher, P; Cherel, Y								Seasonal changes in biomass, growth rates and production of subantarctic calanoid copepods in the Bay of Morbihan, Kerguelen Islands								MARINE BIOLOGY				142	3			525	536		10.1007/s00227-002-0976-5				MAR 2003	2003	The present study addresses the ecology of two dominant copepod species in the Bay of Morbihan, Kerguelen Archipelago. The biomass of the herbivore Drepanopus pectinatus (from 2 mg m(-3) in winter up to 500 mg m(-3) in summer) is tightly coupled to seasonal changes in chlorophyll a concentration in the region, whereas the biomass of the predatory euchaetiid Paraeuchaeta antarctica increases during two distinct periods over the year: 250 mg m(-3) in early summer, with the recruitment of the annual generation, and 100 mg m(-3) in autumn, with the deposition of lipids as energy reserves in C5 stages and adults. The juvenile growth rates predicted by temperature-dependent models (0.09 day(-1)) closely approximate those observed in D. pectinatusin summer, but are much greater than those observed in P. antarctica (from 0.001 to 0.04 day(-1) depending on developmental stages). This difference can be explained by the reproductive strategies and trophic positions of the two species and may also result from the dependence of larval growth on energy reserves in P. antarctica. The production rates are five- and tenfold greater in juvenile stages than in adults, respectively, for D. pectinatus and P. antarctica. The secondary production by D. pectinatusis insufficient to support P. antarctica during winter, when the predatory species probably shifts to alternate prey. In summer the predation by P. antarctica accounts for only a minor part of the mortality estimated for D. pectinatus (from 20% to 60% depending on the examined station). At two of the three stations examined in the Bay of Morbihan, the production of P. antarctica could potentially support the dietary requirements of planktivorous seabirds in the region (similar to2,000 kg prey day(-1) for common diving petrels, Pelecanoides urinatrix, and similar to90 kg prey day(-1) for rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chysocomefilholi).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0025-3162			WOS:000182387900013

During power generation, flow and temperature were the two main environmental factors modified. The natural flow in the river below the outlet may be enhanced several times a day from 1 to 11 m(3) s(-1) in summer and winter, and from 5 to 15 m(3).s(-1) during spring spates. During hydropeaking, the water was cooled by an average of 6 degreesC in summer and warmed by an average of 2 degreesC in winter. Overall drift density was higher at site B than at site A. There was a clear diel pattern of drift at site A, with low drift density during the day and high drift density at night, whereas no clear diel pattern was observed at site B. Below the plant, at site B, drift pattern appeared to be influenced most by hydropeaking. The flushing action of peaking flows caused a catastrophic drift, which was highest in autumn when the difference between natural and peak flows was greatest. Juvenile trout were adversely affected by hydropeaking conditions and subsequently their density and biomass were reduced by 30% from site A to site 13, whereas no significant difference was noticed for adults. Gut contents analysis showed that brown trout chiefly fed on the most available prey items at both sites. Fish did not seem to feed in response to diel drift patterns above the plant, whereas they chiefly used drift pulses generated by peaking flows below the outlet. Under natural conditions, fullness indices increased from autumn to summer, suggesting they may be related to prey availability and changes in water temperature. In the regulated section, fullness indices were the lowest in spring, i.e. the season when peak flows added to snowmelt floods, suggesting a prominent role of high cur-rent velocities through habitat suitability, position maintenance, and ability to capture preys. Although hydropeaking is known to disturb trout population dynamics in this and other rivers, this kind of river regulation (natural discharge except during periods of power generation, and intermittent hydropeaking from a separate reservoir) allowed the maintain of brown trout below the outlet, probably because the river returned to natural conditions when the plant was inoperative, and because daily artificial fluctuations in flow and temperature remained within the limits of natural seasonal variations.

The two localities differed in elevation, ambient temperature, and arthropod availability. We supplemented the two study areas with food (husked peanuts) throughout the study period. The percentage of time tits spent at feeders was higher at El Ventorrillo (the locality that was colder and had lower natural food availability) and was associated with dominance only at this locality. The number of aggressive displacements per hour experienced by each individual was 150 times higher in the area with lower arthropod availability and lower temperatures. Protein reserves (measured as pectoralis muscle thickness) were higher at El Ventorrillo and were positively and consistently related to dominance at both localities. Growth rate of induced feathers was slower at Fl Ventorrillo but was not directly related to dominance in either locality. Only dominant adult males at El Ventorrillo compensated for the environmental harshness at this locality by attaining a higher feather growth rate than the other sex/age classes. Feather-mass asymmetry of induced feathers during autumn was not associated with body condition, did not change between localities, and was inversely and consistently related to dominance at both localities. The covariation among variables describing bird size, access to supplemental food, body condition, feather growth rate, and asymmetry was different at the two localities. Larger, dominant Great Tits spent more time foraging at feeders, had a thicker pectoralis muscle (i.e. body condition), and grew induced feathers at a higher rate only at the locality with colder temperatures and lower food availability.									75	2	0	0	71	1	76			0004-8038			WOS:000074893700016

The PNz and PPz were assessed for a period of 10 years (1999-2008) in relation to water level (WL) changes which occurred during that period. We estimated PNz and PPz, based on crustacean N and P content measured seasonally over 2 years, and a 10-year record of zooplankton densities. Mean cladoceran N and P contents were 8.7 and 1.2% of dry weight, respectively, while for copepods they were 9.5 and 1.5% of dry weight, respectively. Zooplankton density, and hence PNz and PPz, changed dramatically during the 10 years, concurrent with extreme variations in the lake's WL. The lowest mean values of PNz and PPz occurred during high WL years and the highest PNz and PPz were during low WL years. PNz and PPz were negatively correlated with the total PN and PP concentrations, respectively, in the lake. The reduction in zooplankton contribution to the particulate N and P during high WL is probably due to higher loading of particulate matter in wet years, causing an increase of PN and PP concentration in the lake, as well as lower densities of zooplankton, caused by higher fish predation pressure, both are a by-product of the large water influx during extreme wet winters.									4	0	0	0	4	0	5			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000282179900011

Environmental Constraints on Piscivory: Insights from Linking Ultrasonic Telemetry to a Visual Foraging Model for Cutthroat Trout								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				142	1			300	316		10.1080/00028487.2012.732650				JAN 1 2013	2013	Management of pelagic food webs under a shifting climate requires an understanding of how behavior, physiological tolerance, and the environment interact to mediate the foraging rates of consumers. However, analyses that treat each of these factors explicitly in a framework that captures interdependencies are lacking. We linked a visual foraging model and bioenergetics simulations with ultrasonic telemetry to mechanistically evaluate how stressful abiotic conditions (high temperature and low dissolved oxygen) influenced the foraging success of piscivorous Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii feeding on juvenile salmonids in Strawberry Reservoir, Utah. Our primary objectives were to (1) determine whether the foraging success of apex predators changes during periods of environmental stress and (2) identify the behavioral mechanisms that either lead to or buffer against shifts in foraging success. During early and mid-August, high epilimnetic temperatures and low hypolimnetic oxygen levels generated divergent diel vertical distributions between predators and prey. Consequently, encounters with prey were restricted to crepuscular or early morning periods, and the potential foraging success of the piscivores was reduced by 53-98%. Conversely, predator-prey overlap increased considerably when the reservoir was destratified during October, allowing the piscivores to achieve up to 98% of their maximum predation rate. Comparison of encounter and predation rate estimates from the visual foraging model with estimates of fish consumption from a bioenergetics model indicated that prey capture success was higher for piscivores during low-light periods. Therefore, as periods of stress impose constraints on the distribution of pelagic fishes, the magnitude of piscivory will depend on the resulting temporal-spatial overlap of predators and prey in complex ways. This study demonstrates how dynamic environmental conditions can mediate foraging success of piscivores and predation risk for prey.

Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species' population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Examining only specimens in similar developmental stages, those from small ponds (with higher temperature and higher tadpole density) had lower growth rates, lower relative tail height, lower relative body width and fewer labial keratodonts and keratodont rows. The variation in keratodonts may have been caused by heterochrony related to the slower growth rate. The number of lingual papillae also differed between ponds but was not related to pond size. Higher predator densities caused a higher percentage of damaged tails and a lower relative tail length in specimens with apparently intact tails, probably as a result of incomplete regeneration after mutilations earlier in development.									37	0	3	0	33	0	41			0952-8369			WOS:000176498400003

Part 1: The model								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				74	4			479	499		10.1016/j.pocean.2007.05.002				2007	2007	This paper presents an original size-structured mathematical model of the energy flow through marine ecosystems, based on established ecological and physiological processes and mass conservation principles. The model is based on a nonlocal partial differential equation which represents the transfer of energy in both time and body weight (size) in marine ecosystems. The processes taken into account include size-based opportunistic trophic interactions, competition for food, allocation of energy between growth and reproduction, somatic and maturity maintenance, predatory and starvation mortality. All the physiological rates are temperature-dependent. The physiological bases of the model are derived from the dynamic energy budget theory. The model outputs the dynamic size-spectrum of marine ecosystems in term of energy content per weight class as well as many other size-dependent diagnostic variables such as growth rate, egg production or predation mortality.In stable environmental conditions and using a reference set of parameters derived from empirical studies, the model converges toward a stationary linear log-log size-spectrum with a slope equal to -1.06, which is consistent with the values reported in empirical studies. In some cases, the distribution of the largest sizes departs from the stationary linear solution and is slightly curved downward. A sensitivity analysis to the parameters is conducted systematically. It shows that the stationary size-spectrum is not very sensitive to the parameters of the model. Numerical simulations of the effects of temperature and primary production variability on marine ecosystems size-spectra are provided in a companion paper [Maury, O., Shin, Y.J., Faugeras, B., Ben Ari, T., Marsac, F., 2007.

J	Moriarty, Pamela E.; Essington, Timothy E.; Horne, John K.; Keister, Julie E.; Li, Lingbo; Parker-Stetter, Sandra L.; Sato, Mei								Unexpected food web responses to low dissolved oxygen in an estuarine fjord								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS											10.1002/eap.2204		AUG 2020			2020	In coastal marine ecosystems, the depletion of dissolved oxygen can cause behavioral and distributional shifts of organisms and thereby alter ecological processes. We used the spatiotemporal variation in the onset and intensity of low dissolved oxygen in Hood Canal, Washington, USA, to investigate consequences of seasonally reduced oxygen on fish-zooplankton predator-prey interactions. By simultaneously monitoring densities of zooplankton (primarily the euphausiid;Euphausia pacifica) and zooplanktivorous fish (Pacific herring,Clupea pallasii, and Pacific hake,Mercluccius productus), and the feeding of zooplanktivorous fish, we could separate the effects of dissolved oxygen on fish-zooplankton interactions from other seasonal changes. We expected that fish predators (especially Pacific herring) would be less abundant and have lower feeding rates when oxygen levels declined below biological thresholds, and that this would result in increased zooplankton abundance in areas with lowest dissolved oxygen. However, these expectations were not borne out. Overall, there was mixed evidence for an effect of dissolved oxygen on many of our response variables, and when effects were detected, they were frequently in the opposite direction of our expectations. Specifically, the pelagic fish community became more abundant (as measured by increasing acoustic backscatter), which was particularly pronounced for Pacific herring. Zooplankton had weak evidence for a response to dissolved oxygen, but the direction was negative instead of positive. Although predator feeding composition was unrelated to dissolved oxygen, stomach fullness (an index of feeding intensity) of Pacific herring declined, as per our expectations. These unexpected findings highlight the importance of in situ measurements of multiple aspects of predator-prey linkages in response to environmental stress to enhance our ability to predict ecological consequences of declining oxygen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000563789900001	32608148

Annual prey consumption of a dominant seabird, the common murre, in the California Current system								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				65	6			1046	1056		10.1093/icesjms/fsn077				SEP 2008	2008	Information compiled from the literature on population size, diet composition field metabolic rate, prey energy densities, and assimilation efficiency is used to estimate annual prey consumption by common murres (Uria aalge), between Cape Blanco, OR, and Point Conception, CA, USA. The population consumed an estimated 172 313 t of prey based on population estimates and diet data from the mid- to the late 1980s, including 50 125 t consumed by breeding adults, 36 940 t by non-breeding birds during the breeding season, 85 098 t by all birds during the wintering period, and 150 t by dependent chicks before their leaving the breeding colonies. The population in the mid-2000s consumed 225 235 t of prey based on population estimates from 2004, including 65 516 t consumed by breeding adults, 48 283 t by non-breeding birds during the breeding season, 111 226 t by all birds during the wintering period, and 210 t by chicks at breeding colonies. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the coefficients of variation around our overall prey consumption estimates were +/- 14.4% for the 1980s and +/- 13.2% for the 2000s.									13	0	0	0	6	0	13			1054-3139			WOS:000257181600027

Unprecedented breeding failures were recorded at many seabird colonies on the east coast of Britain in 2004, We used demographic, dietary and behavioural data from a long-term study of a colony of common guillemots Uria aalge, the most abundant seabird species in the North Sea, to set the 2004 season in context. Birds at this colony showed greatly reduced breeding success and those chicks that did survive left the colony in very poor condition. The main prey item fed to chicks in 2004 was sprat Sprattus sprattus rather than sandeels, and parents increased the amount of time spent foraging, frequently leaving chicks unattended in order to maintain a normal feeding rate. The calculated daily food intake of chicks derived from these values did not differ markedly from previous years and therefore the magnitude of the impact on chick growth and breeding success appeared disproportionately large. However, nutrient analyses of fish collected from birds in 2004 revealed them to be of significantly lower energy value than expected. Poor food quality therefore appeared to be the proximate cause of seabird breeding failure in 2004 giving support to the 'junk-food' hypothesis. Single-prey loaders such as guillemots will be particularly sensitive to reductions in the energy value of food items. The reasons for the poor fish condition in this part of the North Sea are currently unknown, but the results provide further evidence of major changes in the North Sea food web.									230	0	0	0	220	2	247			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000230387600001

The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87% are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 +/- 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle-stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 +/- 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.									405	2	0	0	363	0	406			0027-8424			WOS:000292251000046	21606358

Behavioural type (mean individual behaviour) has been linked to life-history strategies, leading to the emergence of the integrated pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) theory. Using Rana dalmatina tadpoles as models, we tested if behavioural consistency and POLS could be detected during the early ontogenesis of this amphibian. We targeted two ontogenetic stages and measured activity, exploration and risk-taking in a common garden experiment, assessing both individual behavioural type and intra-individual behavioural variation. We observed that activity was consistent in all tadpoles, exploration only became consistent with advancing age and risk-taking only became consistent in tadpoles that had been tested, and thus disturbed, earlier. Only previously tested tadpoles showed trends indicative of behavioural syndromes. We found an activity-age at metamorphosis POLS in the previously untested tadpoles irrespective of age. Relative growth rate correlated positively with the intra-individual variation of activity of the previously untested older tadpoles. In previously tested older tadpoles, intra-individual variation of exploration correlated negatively and intra-individual variation of risk-taking correlated positively with relative growth rate. We provide evidence for behavioural consistency and POLS in predator-and conspecific-naive tadpoles. Intra-individual behavioural variation was also correlated to life history, suggesting its relevance for the POLS theory. The strong effect of moderate disturbance related to standard behavioural testing on later behaviour draws attention to the pitfalls embedded in repeated testing.									32	1	0	0	30	0	33			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000354725200011	25656582

The observed seasonal patterns of commercial catch and egg production could only be reproduced with fast growth rates, which linked winter egg production with the subsequent juvenile recruitment in May-June, the commercial catch peak in September and the peak in egg production over the following winter. Likewise, substantially lowered natural mortalities in winter are essential to generate seasonal patterns similar to the observed ones. The seasonal pattern of egg production can only be reproduced with a minimum spawning age. Cohorts from summer eggs rapidly follow the earlier winter egg cohorts, forming an annual joint wave of growing shrimp. The summer egg cohort originates from summer eggs of the previous year and, depending on winter and spring mortality levels, also from large individuals of the preceding winter egg cohort. The model represents a new tool to investigate maximum yield per recruit in this species as a function of seasonal effort levels, mesh sizes and seasonal closures under different predation and temperature scenarios.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000418268900009		
J	Cook, Timothee R.; Brischoux, Francois								Why does the only 'planktonic tetrapod' dive? Determinants of diving behaviour in a marine ectotherm								ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				98				113	123		10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.018				DEC 2014	2014	Marine tetrapods represent powerful models for studying how evolutionary transitions shape the life history traits, physiology and behaviour of animals. Whereas adaptations to diving are driven primarily by the need to secure underwater food, diving in the pelagic sea snake, Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus, seems less foraging-dependent. Indeed, this reptile captures fish while floating at the sea surface. Despite knowledge about its surface ecology, its underwater behaviour remains mostly unknown. Yet, study of this life phase is a key to understanding how and why this snake dives. In this study, we reanalysed published data on its diving behaviour. The pelagic sea snake spends 95% of its time underwater, where it can dive to 50 m and stay for 3.5 h without breathing. Dives are S-shaped, with a long phase of gradual ascent during which the snake is neutrally buoyant. Snake lungs deflate slowly during this phase at a rate that increases with water temperature, and thus metabolism. Dive duration is linked to inferred lung volume at the start of the dive, suggesting aerobic diving. We propose that pelagic sea snakes dive for multiple reasons, but primarily to avoid sea surface turbulence. Underwater, they can reduce metabolism by targeting cooler water layers. By hovering in the water column, they reduce energy expenditure and escape both surface and bottom predators, while more easily locating their own prey from underneath. Some marine turtles occasionally display S-shaped dives, but the role of such dives remains under debate. We suggest the study of sea snakes can help interpret diving behaviour in other lineages of marine reptiles. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

English sole are risk prone, adopting behavior that renders them more vulnerable to predation, while northern rock sole are more risk averse. Pacific halibut are risk sensitive and modulate behavior to match perceived threats. We hypothesized that risk-taking behavior and intrinsic growth rate would be positively correlated in these species. We examined the willingness of each species to feed, both in the presence and absence of risk, and in separate experiments we measured their intrinsic growth rates under a range of temperatures. As predicted, risky behavior in English sole was accompanied by high intrinsic growth, while risk aversion in rock sole was accompanied by low growth. Pacific halibut confounded predictions, combining moderate risk-taking behavior with high growth. Lastly, we examined the depth distribution of each species. We expected English sole would be restricted to the shallows (<5 m), where predators are less common, while rock sole would have a deeper distribution, being better able to co-exist with predators. Halibut were expected to present an intermediate depth distribution. Again, English sole and rock sole conformed to predictions, while Pacific halibut confounded them by having a deeper depth distribution, comparable to that of rock sole. We suspect that the behavioral plasticity of Pacific halibut, combined with refuging behavior and well-developed escape capabilities, may allow them to have both high intrinsic growth as well as the ability to coexist with the predators. Thus, our results provide only partial support for our hypothesis that behavior and growth are co-evolved traits that together control the distribution of juvenile flatfishes across predation gradients.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000306689800014

The cause of the decline is currently unclear; however, parasites, predation, and climate change have all been implicated. Nematode parasites are important pathogens in North American moose, potentially causing severe disease and mortality. Recent spread of Rumenfilaria andersoni, a filarioid nematode of moose, has been documented in Finnish cervids; however, little is known about the epidemiology of this parasite in North America.Methods: To investigate the prevalence and distribution of R. andersoni, 584 blood samples were collected from live-captured and dead animals and screened microscopically for the presence of microfilariae using a modified Knott's test. Microfilariae were identified based on morphological characteristics. A subset of Knott's-positive animals was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with filarioid-specific primers targeting the first internal transcribed spacer region (ITS-1) of the rRNA gene cluster.Results: Rumenfilaria microfilariae were present in 20.5 % of Minnesota moose (n = 352), with slight fluctuations observed over four years. Minnesota white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (n = 2) and moose (n = 44) from Alaska, Montana, Washington, Maine, and New Hampshire also harbored R. andersoni, suggesting this parasite occurs widely throughout North American moose herds, and white-tailed deer can serve as a patent host. Sequence analysis of cervid blood (moose, n = 15; white-tailed deer, n = 1) confirmed the identity of R. andersoni and revealed the existence of two distinct clades. Genetic comparisons of R. andersoni isolates from North America and semi-domesticated Finnish reindeer found the two groups to be closely related, supporting previous hypotheses that R. andersoni was recently introduced into Finland by the importation of deer from the United States.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge these observations represent the first report of R. andersoni within the contiguous United States and reveal this nematode as a common parasite of North American moose and white-tailed deer. Although the implications of R. andersoni infection on moose health is unclear, increased awareness of this parasite will help prevent unintentional introduction of R. andersoni into naive populations via the translocation of wild and captive cervids.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1756-3305			WOS:000383835900005	27519789	
J	Amirowicz, Antoni; Gwiazda, Robert								How equally sized piscivorous birds and fish sharing common food resources may reduce possible feeding interactions between them?								HYDROBIOLOGIA				696	1			95	105		10.1007/s10750-012-1186-x				OCT 2012	2012	The diets of sympatric predators may overlap, especially when their body sizes are similar and foraging area is relatively small. It may be also supposed that some differences in their foraging strategies may counteract competitive interactions among them, and therefore be of advantage to these species. To reveal such phenomena the composition of food of cormorant and adult pikeperch was studied in the Dobczyce Reservoir (S Poland) from June to November 2002. The main prey species were the same and the range of prey size was similar for both piscivores. Despite these similarities, the potential for dietary overlap was strongly reduced due to two differences in their foraging patterns: (1) different preferred prey species (cormorants foraged mainly roach, whereas pikeperch selected juvenile percids); (2) different size of simultaneously selected prey (in summer, cormorants selected larger prey, while in autumn larger prey was selected by pikeperch). These differences may be explained by some general features of birds and fishes, which determine the costs to the individual of capturing prey. The observed selection of different prey species and sizes may be also important for the co-occurrence of other piscivorous birds and fishes sharing common food resources.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000307533000006		
J	Sorci, G; Clobert, J; Belichon, S								Phenotypic plasticity of growth and survival in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				65	6			781	790		10.2307/5676				NOV 1996	1996	1. In this study we investigated sources of variation in growth rate and survival in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara.2. We conducted two experiments to identify factors that explain the pattern of geographic variation of life-history traits in this species. In the first experiment, we raised hatchlings from two French populations of L. vivipara, located at low (150 m) and high (1400 m) altitudes, under identical laboratory conditions. The hatchlings grew at the same rate when experiencing the same environmental conditions irrespective of their origin. This finding suggests that the observed differences in growth rate between these two populations of L. vivipara are driven by environmental factors (e.g. thermal environment) rather than genetic divergence. Although we did not find any genetic difference between populations, we found some evidence of within-population variation in growth rate.3. In a second experiment, we raised hatchlings from the high altitude population in outdoor enclosures located at low and high altitudes. The site where hatchlings were raised had a large impact on both growth and survival. Lizards located in the low altitude site grew faster and had a higher mortality rate than lizards located in the high altitude site. These findings are consistent with the observed differences in growth and survival between the natural populations inhabiting the two localities,4. In spite of the low statistical power of the models used to detect the family x environment interactions, we found a marginally significant interaction for survival (P = 0.054), which suggests that phenotypic plasticity of this trait may have some degree of genetic variance.5. Finally, we did not find any evidence for a genetic correlation between growth and survival in the high altitude population. This suggests that the observed phenotypic trade-off between the two traits may arise from environmental constraints (e.g. more active lizards have higher growth rates but also have higher risks of predation).6. Overall, our findings emphasize that environmental factors may play a major role in shaping patterns of life-history association in L. vivipara, and in explaining geographic variation of life histories.									84	2	0	0	80	1	86			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:A1996VY33100010		
J	Ger, Kemal Ali; Naus-Wiezer, Suzanne; De Meester, Luc; Lurling, Miquel				Ger, Kemal Ali/AAD-9150-2019				Zooplankton grazing selectivity regulates herbivory and dominance of toxic phytoplankton over multiple prey generations								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				64	3			1214	1227		10.1002/lno.11108				MAY 2019	2019	How grazer selectivity regulates the primary producer community is a core topic in ecology. Yet, the role of zooplankton grazing selection on phytoplankton dynamics is poorly understood. Few studies have compared the effect of grazers with contrasting selectivity on mixed phytoplankton prey, and none over multiple phytoplankton generations. We tested the hypothesis that a selectively grazing copepod (Eudiaptomus gracilis) would facilitate the dominance of a toxic cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) by grazing on a competing eukaryotic microalga (Cryptomonas pyrenoidifera), while a generalist cladoceran (Daphnia magna) would have no effect on the dominance of cyanobacteria in 4-d laboratory cocultures. Experiments started with a ninefold initial dominance of Cryptomonas over Microcystis by biomass. Each grazer type was added to cocultured phytoplankton and the abundance of phytoplankton was compared to no-grazer controls. As predicted, Daphnia had no effect on the relative abundance of its prey and the copepod facilitated Microcystis dominance, although the strength of facilitation slightly declined with time. As the copepod reduced mostly the biomass of the edible algae, it pushed the system toward the dominance of toxic prey, which likely reduced the efficiency of selective grazing on the last day. Hence, while the selective grazer promoted cyanobacterial dominance, the effect may be weaker than predicted from extrapolating grazing rates obtained from short-term (i.e., hourly) assays. Overall, predicting the role of zooplankton selectivity on phytoplankton dynamics-especially harmful algal blooms-would benefit from accounting for fluctuations in grazer effects due to shifting abundance and growth of each prey over time.									8	0	0	0	5	0	8			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000467593600024		
J	Hoover, Richard A.; Armour, Ruth; Dow, Ian; Purcell, Jennifer E.								Nudibranch predation and dietary preference for the polyps of Aurelia labiata (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa)								HYDROBIOLOGIA				690	1			199	213		10.1007/s10750-012-1044-x				JUL 2012	2012	There is concern that jellyfish blooms may be increasing worldwide. Some factors controlling population size, such as temperature and food, often have been studied; however, the importance of predators is poorly known. Aeolid nudibranchs feed on cnidarians, but their predation on the benthic polyps of scyphozoan rarely has been documented. To understand the potential of nudibranchs to consume polyps, we tested several predation preference hypotheses with the generalist feeding nudibranch, Hermissenda crassicornis, and polyps of the common moon jellyfish, Aurelia labiata. Of the six prey species tested during feeding experiments, A. labiata polyps and the tunicate Distaplia occidentalis were significantly preferred. Nudibranch size, diurnal cycle, and ingestive conditioning did not significantly influence prey choice. Nudibranchs showed significant positive chemotaxis toward living polyps, hydroids, and tunicates, but not to sea anemones. Nudibranch chemotaxis was significantly more positive to polar extract of A. labiata than of D. occidentalis. Consumption of polyps was correlated with nudibranch size, with mean consumption by large nudibranchs (> 0.92 g) of about 31 polyps h(-1). Three other nudibranch species also ate A. labiata polyps. Our results emphasize the potential importance of predation for controlling jellyfish benthic polyp populations and consequent jellyfish blooms.									18	1	0	0	18	0	19			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000304626600016

Bycatch in a Commercial Lobster Fishery: Effects on Two Benthic Predators, Sea Raven and Longhorn Sculpin								MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES				12	2			113	123		10.1002/mcf2.10114				APR 2020	2020	Studying the species-specific responses to fishing capture is critical for effective management and conservation of bycatch species given that acute stress incurred from capture and handling may ultimately lead to mortality. While species of low commercial value are often overlooked, having accurate information on the effects of capture on all species is necessary for ecosystem-based management. Sea Raven (SR) Hemitripterus americanus and Longhorn Sculpin (LHS) Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus are routinely captured in the commercial American lobster Homarus americanus fishery in the Gulf of Maine, and they are discarded due to low commercial value. Despite a lack of economic value, these predatory species play important roles in shaping the benthic communities that they inhabit, highlighting the need to study their stress and mortality due to capture and handling. To help understand the effects of the lobster fishery on these species, the current study evaluated the physical, behavioral, and physiological stress responses of SR and LHS to capture in the state of Maine Zone G commercial lobster fishery. Collectively, our results suggest that although these species appeared to be resilient to capture based on an overt injury assessment, stress responses occurred based on reflex impairment and physiological perturbations, and these responses were species-specific. Given the prevalence of behavioral and physiological stress in this study, further research into the survival outcomes of SR and LHS following release in the commercial lobster fishery is warranted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1942-5120			WOS:000529296400002

We used an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model parameterized for northern British Columbia (Canada), employing Ecosim to simulate ecosystem effects of herring stock collapse. The ecological impacts of various herring fishing strategies were investigated with a Management Strategy Evaluation algorithm within Ecosim, accounting for variability in climatic drivers and stock assessment errors. Ecosim results suggest that herring stock collapse would have cascading impacts on much of the pelagic food web. Management Strategy Evaluation results indicate that herring and their predators suffer moderate impacts from the existing British Columbia harvest control rule, although more precautionary management strategies could substantially reduce these impacts. The non-capture spawn-on-kelp fishery, traditionally practiced by many British Columbia and Alaska indigenous peoples, apparently has extremely limited ecological impacts. Our simulations also suggest that adopting a maximum sustainable yield management strategy in Northeast Pacific herring fisheries could generate strong, cascading food web effects. Furthermore, climate shifts, especially when combined with herring stock assessment errors, could strongly reduce the biomasses and resilience of herring and its predators. By clarifying the trophic role of Pacific herring, this study aims to facilitate precautionary fisheries management via evaluation of alternative fishing strategies, and thereby to inform policy tradeoffs among multiple ecological and socioeconomic factors.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000437809500001	29979718

These causes include deleterious effects of infectious pathogens, some of which are associated with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), negative effects of climate change, increased food competition with deer or moose, legal or illegal hunting, and increased predation by gray wolves (Canis lupus) and black bears (Ursus americanus). Long-standing factors that may have contributed to the moose decline include those typically associated with marginal habitat such as nutritional deficiencies. We examined survival and productivity among radiocollared (n= 152) adult female and juvenile moose in northwest Minnesota during 1995-2000, and assessed cause of death and pathology through carcass necropsy of radiocollared and non-radiocollared animals.Aerial moose surveys suggested that hunting was an unlikely source of the numerical decline because the level of harvest was relatively low (i.e., approx. 15%/2 yr) and the population usually grew in years following a hunt. The majority of moose mortalities (up to 87% of radiocollared moose [n = 76] and up to 65% of non-radiocollared moose [n = 84]) were proximally related to pathology associated with parasites and infectious disease. Liver fluke (Fascioloides magna) infections apparently constituted the greatest single source of mortality and caused significant pathology in the liver, thoracic and peritoneal cavities, pericardial sac, and lungs. Mortality due to meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) was less prevalent and was manifested through characteristic neurological disease. Several mortalities apparently were associated with unidentified infectious disease, probably acting in close association with malnutrition. Bone-marrow fat was lower for moose dying of natural causes than those dying of anthropogenic factors or accidents, implying that acute malnutrition contributed to moose mortality. Blood profiles from live-captured animals indicated that those dying in the subsequent 18 months were chronically malnourished.Relative to other populations, average annual survival rates for adult females (0.79 [0.74-0.84; 95% Cl]) and yearlings (0.64 [0.48-0.86]) were low, whereas those for calves (0.66 [0.53-081]) were high. Pregnancy (48%) and twinning (19%) rates were among the lowest reported for moose, with reproductive senescence among females being apparent as early as 8 years. Pregnancy status was related to indices of acute (i.e., bone-marrow fat) and chronic (i.e., blood condition indices) malnutrition. Opportunistic carcass recovery indicated that there likely were few prime-aged males (> 5 yr old) in the population.Analysis of protein content in moose browse and fecal samples indicated that food quality was probably adequate to support moose over winter, but the higher fecal protein among animals that died in the subsequent 18 months could be indicative of protein catabolism associated with malnutrition. Trace element analysis from moose livers revealed apparent deficiencies in copper and selenium, but there was limited evidence of direct association between trace element concentrations and moose disease, pathology, or mortality. Time-series analysis of regional moose counts (1961-2000) indicated that annual population growth rate was related negatively to mean summer temperature, with winter and summer temperatures increasing by an average of 6.8 and 2.1 C, respectively, during the 40-year period. This change may have increased moose thermoregulatory costs and disrupted their energy balance, and thereby reduced their fitness. Time-series analysis failed to show a relationship between annual population growth rate and moose or deer abundance, indicating that food limitation via resource competition was unlikely. Population viability analyses, using count data (1961-2000) and demographic data collected during this study, suggested that the northwest Minnesota moose population likely would not persist over the next 50 years. More broadly, we conclude that the southern distribution of moose may become restricted in areas where climate and habitat conditions are marginal, especially where deer are abundant and act as reservoir hosts for parasites.									92	1	0	0	103	0	114			0084-0173	1938-5455		WOS:000244136000001

This predator was reared at constant temperatures of 20, 23, 25, 28, 30 and 33 +/- 0.2 degreesC, all at relative humidity of 60 +/- 10%, and a photoperiod of L: D 14: 10. Fecundity of P. nigrispinus at the various temperatures ranged from 401.2 (33degreesC) to 841.3 (28degreesC) eggs/female. The preoviposition, oviposition peak, and declining oviposition periods of P. nigrispinus were affected by temperature [ preoviposition period: 4.0 (33degreesC) to 13.2 (20degreesC) days; duration of oviposition peak period: 9.0 (33degreesC) to 33.0 (20degreesC) days; and duration of declining oviposition period: 16.0 (33degreesC) to 46.0 (20degreesC) days]. Longevity of females and males of P. nigrispinus ranged from 28.4 (33degreesC) to 88.6 (20degreesC) days, and from 42.7 (33degreesC) to 114.3 (20degreesC) days, respectively. These data are useful in relation to the development of population dynamics models to underpin programmes of biological control.									12	0	0	0	9	3	12			1386-6141			WOS:000186272500006

The relative predatory threats were examined over four sets of binary factors, including the following: (a) short (2-day) or long (7-day) duration, (b) presence/absence of fine sediment, (c) live or dead larvae and (d) species of lampreys. Our short-term results showed a positive correlation with the sizes of predator fishes and consumed lamprey larvae. Also, most predator fishes had a significantly higher propensity to prey on lamprey larvae when sediment was absent. Conversely, this demonstrated the importance of sediment in protecting lamprey larvae from predation. Based on the predatory behaviour for live and dead larvae, predator fishes were classified into four groups using principal component analysis. Predation rates of larvae in sediment by piscivorous predators including Northern Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu were lower and showed no differences even when the study duration was extended. In contrast, predation rates by benthic predators including White Sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus and Common Carp Cyprinus carpio, increased when we extended the study duration. This suggests that when given longer duration, benthic predators are more adept at consuming larvae within the sediment. These results provide important context for assessing the potential threat of predation on lampreys in streams, which is a key knowledge gap for lampreys.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000514698400001

However, the importance of streams as promoters of non-riparian forest diversity has not been explored in detail. Given the likely stronger effect of surrounding habitats on open forests, we examined chestnut woodlands in northern Spain (n = 32) to explore the contribution of streams to variation in arthropod measures. We captured 5,490 arthropods (21 orders and 60 families) from which we calculated total abundance and richness and the abundance of trophic guilds. Vegetation structure at the tree and understory levels often made the largest independent contributions to explained variation in arthropod numbers and effects suggested alterations in arthropods' food-web. Negative effects of stream-distance on taxon richness and the abundance of predators, omnivores and phytophages seemed to be largely mediated by vegetation structure. The exception was a strong univariate inverse association between the abundance of aerial predators and stream distance, possibly because wasps might be exploiting riverine habitats. Overall, effects of stream-distance were weaker for ground than for aerial arthropod groups. Moreover, arthropod numbers were greater at sites with low tree species richness and tall and species-rich understories, raising concerns for the ecological consequences of the abandonment of traditional forest practices in these woodlands. There are likely to be advantages for arthropod diversity and ecosystem services (e.g. pest control, nutrient cycling, pollination) if non-riparian forests are managed in a way that depends on stream-distance. Inferences may improve with a more complete knowledge of the biology of poorly studied groups, such as flies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1127	1872-7042		WOS:000518874700016

They are a food source for zooplankton or higher predators such as fishes, whales and birds that is particularly important in high latitude areas. Since they harbor a highly soluble aragonitic shell, they could be very sensitive to ocean acidification driven by the increase of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The effect of changes in the seawater chemistry was investigated on Limacina helicina, a key species of Arctic pelagic ecosystems. Individuals were kept in the laboratory under controlled pCO(2) levels of 280, 380, 550, 760 and 1020 mu atm and at control (0 degrees C) and elevated (4 degrees C) temperatures. The respiration rate was unaffected by pCO(2) at control temperature, but significantly increased as a function of the pCO(2) level at elevated temperature. pCO(2) had no effect on the gut clearance rate at either temperature. Precipitation of CaCO3, measured as the incorporation of Ca-45, significantly declined as a function of pCO(2) at both temperatures. The decrease in calcium carbonate precipitation was highly correlated to the aragonite saturation state. Even though this study demonstrates that pteropods are able to precipitate calcium carbonate at low aragonite saturation state, the results support the current concern for the future of Arctic pteropods, as the production of their shell appears to be very sensitive to decreased pH. A decline of pteropod populations would likely cause dramatic changes to various pelagic ecosystems.									113	1	0	0	89	0	115			1932-6203			WOS:000279369900011	20613868

Survival after 7 and 14 d at 2 experimental temperatures was analyzed. There was no consistent difference in survival between sympatric versus allopatric populations at both 7 and 14 d. Multivariate analysis indicated a significant population-environment interaction involving population, temperature, and predation. This interaction was only significant in univariate analyses at 14 d, accounting for 29.9% of the random variation in survival. Populations surviving best or worst with the predator at 20 degrees C did not also survive best or worst, respectively with the predator at 24 degrees C. Survival was also unrelated to long-term average temperatures from the collection sites. Net reduction in survival as a result of predation tended to occur earlier at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, net reduction in survival because of T. rutilus predation was statistically undetectable after 7 d, but was significant after 14 d. Populations of A. triseriatus varied considerably in their ability to survive with this predator, and in their survival at the study temperatures, but population cooccurrence with the predator and long-term average temperatures from the collection sites appeared to be unrelated to this variation. Variation among populations is only apparent after a fairly long period of development, and tile pattern of variation is highly dependent on the experimental temperature. Geographic differentiation in survival with this predator seems likely to be a by-product of geographic variation in growth, development, and feeding rates of A. triseriatus, and unlikely to be primarily a product of natural selection by T. rutilus predation in nature.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0046-225X			WOS:A1996UR93900011

To understand the diel activity of Northern Snakehead Channa argus, feeding habits and movement patterns were observed. Two hundred seventy-three Northern Snakehead were captured by boat electrofishing during May and June of 2007 and 2008. Their gut contents were extracted and preserved. The level of digestion of each prey item was estimated from fresh (1) to >50% digested (4) or empty (5). Random forest models were used to predict feeding activity based on time of day, tide level, date, water temperature, fish total length, and sex. Diel movement patterns were assessed by implanting Northern Snakehead with radio transmitters and monitoring them every 1.5 h for 24 h in both March and July 2007. Movement rates were compared between March and July and among four daily time periods. Independent variables accounted for only 6% of the variation in feeding activity; however, temporal feeding patterns were apparent. No fresh items were observed in guts between 12:30 and 7:30 am, and the proportion of empty stomachs increased at the end of May coinciding with the onset of spawning. Overall, fish moved greater distances during the July tracking period compared to March. Fish showed a greater propensity to move during daylight hours than at night during the March tracking period. A similar but nonsignificant (P > 0.05) pattern was observed in July. Movement and feeding data both indicated greater activity during daylight hours than at night, suggesting that Northern Snakehead is a diurnal species. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that a) diurnal species are more susceptible than nocturnal species to predation by Northern Snakehead and b) Northern Snakehead are more likely to compete for food with diurnal than nocturnal predators.					1st International Snakehead Symposium1st International Snakehead Symposium	JUL 17-19, 2018JUL 17-19, 2018	MRBP; Virginia Dept Game & Inland FisheriesMRBP; Virginia Dept Game & Inland Fisheries	Alexandria, VAAlexandria, VA	1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0892-2284		978-1-934874-58-5	WOS:000488426200006

As a measure of competitive ability, threshold food concentrations for growth (C-0) were determined in a flow-through system at 16, 20, 24 and 28 degrees C. Four lake species were tested (in the order of decreasing size): Daphnia pulicaria, D. galeata, D. ambigua and Ceriodaphnia reticulata. C-0 increased at temperatures above 20 degrees C, but the rank order of species was retained, i.e., the larger species had lower C-0 at all temperatures. The two smallest species showed a dramatic increase of C-0 al 28 degrees C, hence their competitive ability was severely reduced.The hypothesis was rejected. In the temperature range tested, small cladoceran species were not competitively superior to large ones. The observed size shift from larger to smaller zooplankton in lakes with increasing temperature may be due to selective factors other than direct competition (e.g., predation, food quality).									49	7	2	0	51	1	60			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:A1997XF18500006

Fatty acid biomarkers were used to investigate the diets of scallops and to evaluate the food availability at the sites with different bottom sediments. Fatty acid composition of digestive gland and soft tissues of scallops from two populations were examined and compared to those of plankton, particular organic matter of near-bottom water and bottom sediments as its potential food sources. The high level of 20:5(n - 3) coupled with the high ratio of 16:1 (n - 7) to 16:0 in the digestive gland of scallop indicated an important contribution of diatoms to scallop nutrition. The relatively high proportions of 18:2(n-6), 20:4(n-6), and 22:6(n-3) suggested that heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, and invertebrate larvae were also an important source of nutrition for the scallop. Trace amounts of branched and odd fatty acids were indicative of an insignificant contribution of detritus to scallop diet. Lipid and fatty acid compositions of scallops from two sites were characterized by pronounced differences pointing to the different food availability in near-bottom water at the muddy and sandy sites. Higher food availability at the muddy site resulted in an increase in the total lipid content in scallop's digestive gland due to increased proportion of triacylglycerols. Increased contents of diatom biomarkers indicated that scallops inhabiting muddy bottom were more reliant on diatom food sources. Scallops from the sandy site showed higher proportions of biomarkers derived from flagellates, ciliates, and invertebrate larvae, compared to scallops from the muddy site. This is consistent with the distribution of the fatty acids in near-bottom water POM at the study sites. In spite of the high microbial biomass in muddy bottom sediments and elevated proportion of bacterial fatty acids in near-bottom water POM, bacterial input in scallop diet increased slightly. Thus, the distribution of marker fatty acids in scallops collected at the two sites indicated spatial variability primarily due to the composition and abundance of near-bottom POM, suggesting that scallop feeding is dependent on food availability. Comparison of linear and weight parameters of scallops showed that, in spite of the best food potential at the muddy site, scallops grew significantly slower at the muddy site than at the sandy site. Thus, food potential was not the only factor regulating growth of scallops inhabiting different bottom sediments. It was found, that oxygen concentration in near-bottom water and bottom sediment resuspension depended on the grain-size composition of the sediments. Most probably, low oxygen concentration in the near-bottom water and high resuspension of inorganic fine-grained particles enriched with inedible dead organic matter are the main reasons of the reduction in growth of scallop inhabiting the muddy site.

Currently, there is no information about the reproductive and ecological characteristics of this common fish, so this work aimed to evaluate those aspects, and to contribute with some ecological features. For this, a total of six sampling sites were selected and studied from April 2008 to December 2012. Per site, we determined fish seasonality, feeding, sex ratio, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic and condition factors for both sexes, as well as the fecundity and length-weight relationships. We also considered some environmental parameters such as temperature, water temperature, depth, salinity and pH. Our results on the environmental parameters analysis did not show significant differences for the study period; besides, salinity data confirmed an oligohaline environment, and the rest of the physico-chemical parameters, varied in accordance with the climatic pattern in the area. We captured a total of 519 fishes, 311 (59.9 %) males and 208 (41.1 %) females; the proportion of males resulted favorable against females throughout the study. The standard length found along the study period showed that the average was higher in males than in females. The trophic spectrum was composed of 13 food items, principally crustaceans, molluscs and fishes; in addition, cannibalism was observed over young individuals during March and April. The most advanced stages of gonadal maturation were recorded from November to March for males, and from November to February in females; generally, the Gonadosomatic index (IGS) recorded the highest values from November to April. The Hepatosomatic Index (IHS) and the Condition Factor (FC) presented an inverse relationship with the Gonadosomatic index (IGS). The fecundity of this species ranged from 96 to 428 oocytes per female. The weight-length relationship by sexes and seasons, showed a higher growth rate for males than for females, and an allometric growth type. The biological and ecological information of O. beta in ALS evidenced the importance of this species and its ecological role in the structure and dynamics of these aquatic communities. This species may be used as a model for future proposals dealing with the management and sustainable use of this ecosystem.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0034-7744	2215-2075		WOS:000418999900011

Fish were deprived of food for 10 days (to measure fasting body weight), then fed for 12 days on freshly killed amphipods (to measure individual daily intake). Thereafter, one group was left unfed whilst daily intake of other individuals, offered 2 g and 4 g daily, was monitored. Growth was measured as change in body weight. Growth:Ration relationships were compared between trials and were found to be independent of the different environmental conditions. Appetite was higher under summer conditions and it is argued that seasonality in growth of Antarctic fish is mediated through seasonal variation in resource utilisation rather than seasonal resource availability or temperature-dependent effects on growth.

Increasingly frequent and severe disturbances are causing large-scale coral mortality, usually followed by colonisation and dominance by benthic algae. The capacity of corals to re-establish in such algal-dominated habitats will depend on the effects of the algae on growth and survivorship of juvenile corals. We experimentally evaluated the competition between juvenile corals Porites astreoides and algae and the effects of algae on the exposure of juvenile corals to damage by parrotfishes (family Scaridae) in a Colombian Caribbean reef. We also explored whether those effects were consistent among climatic seasons (upwelling and non-upwelling). Benthic algae had negative and positive effects on the juvenile corals. The removal of algal turfs and fleshy macroalgae enhanced coral growth. Unexpectedly, removal of algae from around the juvenile corals increased predation upon the corals by parrotfishes. When algae were removed, at least 50% of the corals were grazed by parrotfishes, but no bites were observed on corals with intact algae. Coral growth and parrotfish damage were not affected by season. However, damage by parrotfishes neither lessened survivorship nor resulted in negative growth for any of the grazed coral colonies. The beneficial effects of algae in protecting the juvenile corals from parrotfish damage seem to be outweighed by the negative effects of the algae on coral-algal competition. Understanding such complexities in the interactions between algae and early life stages of corals can provide insight into the roles of algae in coral reef resilience.									28	0	0	0	28	2	29			0171-8630			WOS:000286390800009

It was related to temperature, salinity, and weekly growth rates of juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, deployed at these sites during the summer in 2012 and 2013, pre- and post-Hurricane Sandy. Results indicated distinct differences in phytoplankton composition among sites, with a greater contribution of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria at the northernmost site, Island Beach State Park (IBSP). Photopigment analysis was useful in improving upon the taxonomic assessment of pico-coccoid (< 3 mu m) algae that are difficult to identify microscopically. The presence of the brown tide alga, Aureococcus anophagefferens, was confirmed by immunofluorescence during both years, with peak densities of 4.4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) in June 2013 at Sedge Island, in a Marine Conservation Zone that supports clam seeding. Concentrations of 19'but-fucoxanthin and A. anophagefferens showed a strong linear relationship, suggesting that this pigment is a good indicator of this pelagophyte in BB-LEH. The occurrence of brown tide was important to consider in CHEMTAX analysis as it affected the estimated contribution of diatoms to chl a, given that A. anophagefferens is also characterized by a relatively high fucoxanthin: chlorophyll a ratio. Generally, hard-clam tissue-growth rates were greatest at Sedge Island and Tuckerton, LEH, and least at IBSP, a lower salinity site, and off Harvey Cedars, a more developed site along a bulkheaded shoreline. Significant linear relationships were found between clam growth rate and diagnostic photopigments, with positive relationships for indicators of diatoms and negative relationships for those of cyanobacteria and chlorophytes.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0749-0208	1551-5036		WOS:000417480200010

Using individuals captured in Nanchong and Laojunshan Nature Reserve of Sichuan province in western China, we tested head-body length variation in the mole-shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) in relation to annual temperature and elevation. Our results indicate that head-body length of both males and females decreases with decreasing ambient temperature along an altitudinal gradient. Likewise, there is significant monthly variation in head-body length, with individuals in warmer months being larger than that colder ones. The seasonal variation in head-body length suggests the higher predator risk and lower food availability in cold months.									3	1	1	0	2	0	3			1584-9074	1842-6441		WOS:000292712900008

One reason for this may be a loss of natural enemies in marginal populations. Such patterns have been found in native species, but also may occur for exotics if they have not already escaped their herbivores in invaded regions. For instance, the Eurasian biennial Arctium minus (common burdock) is attacked by a variety of native and introduced insects in its new North American range. Previously, research has shown that damage by these herbivores strongly decreases towards the northern range limit of this species. This gradient might reflect a genetic cline in resistance to herbivores, or geographic variation in herbivore abundance. To distinguish between these possibilities, herbivore damage to leaves and seeds of A. minus was measured in a common garden experiment with genotypes sampled from 11 populations along a 550 km transect extending from southern Ontario towards burdock's northern range limit. As well, a freezing tolerance experiment was performed with the important lepidopteran seed predator Metzneria lappella, and palatability experiments were performed with two generalists, the snail Cepaea nemoralis and the moth Trichoplusia ni. Although there were some differences in damage among populations, results indicated that latitudinal differences in herbivore damage are not explained by genotypic differences among populations, but instead are likely to result from the absence of herbivores from colder sites. Escape of A. minus from its usual herbivores may increase performance of marginal populations, and contribute to future spread.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000347526800035

Eunicella singularis is the most abundant gorgonian in shallow waters and the only gorgonian with symbiotic zooxanthellae in the Mediterranean Sea. We studied the natural diet and prey capture rate of this species over an annual cycle and characterized prey digestion time over the natural temperature regime. The species captured zooplankton prey between 40 and 920 A mu m. A mean content of 0.14 +/- A 0.02 prey polyp(-1) was observed throughout the year. The strong pattern of decrease in digestion time with temperature increase (from 25 h at 13 A degrees C to 8 h at 21 A degrees C) allowed us to estimate that the prey capture rate was 0.017 +/- A 0.002 prey polyp(-1) h(-1) (mean +/- A SE); the ingestion rate exhibited a seasonal pattern with higher values in spring (0.007 A mu g C polyp(-1) h(-1)). Feeding on zooplankton had a low contribution to the respiratory expenses of E. singularis except in early spring. Then, heterotrophic nutrition in the natural environment seems unable to meet basal metabolic requirements, especially in summer and fall. This result, in conjunction with the documented collapse of photosynthetic capacity above a warm temperature threshold, indicates the occurrence of a resource acquisition limitation that may play a role in the repeated summer die-off events of the species.									6	0	0	0	6	1	6			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000354189600018

However, avian studies have historically emphasized the importance of resource acquisition over resource allocation to explain geographic variation in fecundity, parental care, and offspring development. We compared the brood sizes and nestling mass and feather growth trajectories between orange-crowned warblers Oreothlypis celata breeding in Alaska versus California, and used 24-h video recordings to study the relationship between parental care and growth rates. Per-offspring provisioning rates were highest in the smallest broods, and food delivery was positively correlated with nestling growth over the 24-h period only in Alaska. Females in Alaska spent more time brooding, and juveniles there showed faster feather growth and earlier mobility compared with those in California. We also found differences in the energetic and nutritional content of insect larvae that could facilitate the observed differences in nestling growth relative to food provisioning. Our results point to the potential importance of food quality and parental provisioning of warmth, in addition to food, for explaining avian growth patterns. We highlight the need to quantify multiple dimensions of parental care and of offspring growth and development, and to better understand the relationships between feather growth, nestling period length, and fledgling mobility.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0908-8857	1600-048X		WOS:000436938400005		
J	Fielding, Dennis J.; Defoliart, Linda S.								Growth, development, and nutritional physiology of grasshoppers from subarctic and temperate regions								PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY				80	6			607	618		10.1086/521801				NOV-DEC 2007	2007	Despite the importance of developmental rate, growth rate, and size at maturity in the life history of poikliotherms, the trade-offs among these traits and selection pressures involved in the evolution of these traits are not well understood. This study compared these traits in a grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes F. (Orthoptera: Acrididae), from two contrasting geographical regions, subarctic Alaska and temperate Idaho. The growing season in the interior of Alaska is about 80 d shorter than at low-elevation sites in Idaho. We hypothesized that the Alaskan grasshoppers would show more rapid growth and development than grasshoppers from Idaho, at the cost of greater sensitivity to food quality. On a diet of lettuce and wheat bran, grasshoppers from Alaska developed from egg hatch to adult more rapidly than those from Idaho at each of three different temperature regimes. Averaged over all temperature treatments, the weight of the Alaskan grasshoppers was about 5% less than that of the Idaho grasshoppers at the adult molt. Feeding and digestive efficiencies were determined for the final two instars using two meridic diets: one with a high concentration of nutrients and the other with the same formulation but diluted with cellulose. Alaskan grasshoppers again developed more rapidly, weighed less, and had faster growth rates than those from Idaho. Alaskan grasshoppers supported their more rapid growth by increasing postingestive efficiencies; that is, they had higher conversion rates of digested matter to biomass on the high-quality diet, greater assimilation of food on the low-quality diet, and greater efficiency of nitrogen assimilation or retention on both diets. There was no evidence that performance of Alaskan grasshoppers suffered any more than that of the Idaho grasshoppers on the low-quality diet.									16	0	0	0	16	0	18			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000249887600005	17909997	
J	Scopel, Lauren; Diamond, Antony; Kress, Stephen; Shannon, Paula								Varied breeding responses of seabirds to a regime shift in prey base in the Gulf of Maine								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				626				177	196		10.3354/meps13048				SEP 12 2019	2019	Seabirds consume forage fish, which are keystone species in many marine ecosystems. The Junk Food Hypothesis proposes that high-lipid prey should produce better reproductive performance by seabirds. In the Gulf of Maine, changes in the forage fish community followed rapid warming post-2005 and included a decline in high-lipid Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. We studied 3 species of alcid (Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, razorbill Alca torda, common murre Uria aalge) over 23 yr at 3 colonies to assess changes in chick diet and its relationships with reproductive success. Puffin and razorbill chick diet changed over time; puffin diet was highly variable taxonomically, whereas razorbill diets were more consistent, showing proportional changes within fewer taxa. For puffins and razorbills, herring was replaced by sand lance Ammodytes spp. and other taxa with lower energy density. Puffins did not require high-lipid fish to breed successfully, but diet-reproduction relationships became unpredictable following extremely warm winters (2013 and 2016). Razorbills and murres provisioning with low-lipid fish showed reduced chick condition and breeding success. We concluded that razorbills and murres need higher-quality diets than puffins, which more frequently exploited lower-lipid food during food shortages. However, puffin reproductive output was much more vulnerable to ocean warming owing to their longer breeding season and more varied diet. Different responses of closely-related species to changes in prey are driven by differences in chick-development strategies with clear implications for using seabirds as environmental indicators.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000485739800014

The majority of published evidence on the effects of NIS on local communities is from single species studies in which the interactive effects of NIS are not considered. Here we present experimental evidence of separate and interactive effects of two widespread non-indigenous benthic predators, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the North American mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) on benthic invertebrate communities in a shallow coastal ecosystem of the Gulf of Riga, the Baltic Sea. The two species have recently colonized multiple sub-basins of the Baltic Sea and due to their rapid range expansion, increasing densities and local functional novelty, they are expected to have strong separate or interactive effects on native communities. Our laboratory experiment demonstrated that round goby and mud crab exerted a significant predation pressure on different benthic invertebrate species and the effects of the studied predators were largely independent. Predation was stronger at higher temperature compared with low temperature treatment. Among the studied invertebrate species gammarid amphipods were consumed the most. Interestingly, round goby did not prey on the mud crabs despite a large size difference of the studied predators.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0025-3154	1469-7769		WOS:000430473000003

The seasonal reoccurrence of algal blooms is partly caused by excessive input of nutrients into coastal ecosystems. At the same time, overfishing of top predators has led to increased densities of smaller predators that reduce herbivore abundance. Managers of coastal ecosystems are in urgent need of information on how overfishing may act synergistically with eutrophication to promote algal blooms. In the present study, we model the interaction between the opportunistic filamentous algae Ulva spp. and the effective mesograzer (small invertebrate herbivore) Gammarus locusta L. under different nutrient regimes and predation rates by intermediate-size fish (4 to 12 cm). The aim is to assess how productivity, herbivory and predation interact to regulate seasonal algal growth under a range of scenarios, including temporal matching or mismatching between trophic groups. The model is parameterised with nutrient and demographic data from a seagrass ecosystem on the west coast of Sweden. Model simulations show that both nutrient level and herbivore abundance regulate seasonal algal biomass in the seagrass meadow. Their relative importance is dynamic and sensitive to the arrival times of herbivores in relation to the start of algal development in spring. Thus, herbivore presence and timing are crucial factors for the control of algal biomass, particularly during times when resource levels are ambient to slightly elevated. Simulations also show that it is mainly the predation rate and timing of predators, rather than food limitation, that limit herbivore abundance. As predation rates by invertebrates and smaller fish can be linked to the presence of larger and commercially targeted fish, overfishing may have similar effects to eutrophication in the seagrass ecosystems.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0171-8630			WOS:000312782700006		
J	Ojaveer, Evald; Kalejs, Margers								Ecology and long-term forecasting of sprat (Sprattus sprattus balticus) stock in the Baltic Sea: a review								REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES				20	2			203	217		10.1007/s11160-009-9130-5				JUN 2010	2010	In the brackish Baltic Sea situated in the transition zone between the Atlantic and Euro-Asiatic continental climate systems, the periods of high abundance of sprat of marine boreal origin coincide with a rich freshwater discharge, large water volume inhabitable by fish, rather high winter temperature and low salinity limiting the stock of its main predator-cod (Gadus morhua callarias). In the freshening periods an additional volume of water with acceptable oxygen and temperature conditions for sprat is formed in the Eastern (E) and, especially, the Northwest (NW) regions of the Baltic Sea. This allows extraordinary increase in sprat abundance/biomass. The conditions for sprat deteriorate during the period of active saline water inflows and colder winters, especially in the NW region. Following the decrease in the volume of water acceptable for the wintering of sprat as to temperature and/or oxygen concentration, some part of the stock may be forced to migrate southwards as in the Southwest (SW) region the conditions are the most stable. This may cause an extensive mixing of the stock components of various regions, hindering the differentiation of sprat regional units in the Baltic Sea. As no isolation of regional spawning concentrations has been found, beginning with 1989 the Baltic sprat has been assessed and managed as one stock unit, despite spatial differences in its morphological characters, growth rate etc. The alternation of periods of different regime-forming conditions (freshening or oceanization) is probably triggered by climate changes. This regularity has been exploited for the composition of long-term forecasts of qualitative changes in fish (incl. sprat) stocks in the Baltic Sea.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000277416500004

During the dry season, collembolans aggregate in wet patches randomly scattered in the dry litter where numerous single workers come hunting from their nest. We simulated this situation in the laboratory, and observed that workers seem to be able to use the humidity gradient direction to efficiently orient themselves towards a wet patch. Once the patch has been reached, they exhibit area-concentrated searching, consisting, in particular, of adopting a high sinuosity and a low speed. After capturing a collembolan, the ants return to their nest along nearly straight paths. This ability may rely on a spatial memory of the nest location by means of a path-integration process. In the absence of prey, however; various behaviours were observed after an unsuccessful search. Comparisons between these data and the results obtained with a homogeneously wet environment simulating the rainy season situation showed that these ants do not simply respond to the humidity level but are also sensitive to the degree of patchiness of their environment. They can therefore be said to be able to adapt suitably to the considerable climatic changes they encounter during the year.									18	0	0	0	13	0	18			0376-6357	1872-8308		WOS:A1993MR36400004	24896947

The first investigation used only five species of carabid Pterostichus melanarius Illiger, Pterostichus madidus F., Harpalus rufipes DeGeer, Nebria brevicollis F. and Carabus violaceus L., which had been caught most commonly in pitfall traps in the headland region of arable crop fields. When offered Brevicoryne brassicae L., Sitobion avenae F., Metopolophium dirhodum Walker and Rhopalosiphum? padi L. as prey items, the species consistently consumed in high numbers was M. dirhodum. In subsequent experiments four carabids Pterostichus cupreus L., P. pitfall trapping to extend throughout the arable crop, were the chosen predators. These predators were offered a choice between M. dirhodum and entomobryid collembolans (a recognised alternative prey item) to gauge their preference between the two prey types. Both male and female P. cupreus and P. melanarius showed a significant preference for the aphid prey, while there was no significant preference displayed by the other species. The effect of temperature on the voracity of these five predators fed on M. dirhodum was investigated. There were significant differences in the number of aphids consumed by the species and sexes at the different temperatures. Regression analysis on the mean numbers of aphids eaten by each sex of the five predators, showed that in the majority of cases there was a significant increase in predation with increasing temperature. In considering the dietary preferences illustrated by these experiments, it appeared that P. cupreus and P. melanarius offered the greatest potential in controlling aphids on arable crops.									27	0	0	0	24	0	28			0931-2048			WOS:000080514000001

The current study is the first comprehensive approach to the spatial distribution and the fluctuations in abundance, biomass, community structure, and diversity of the mesozooplankton from different habitats located in Scotia Bay in summers: 2014 and 2015, characterized by a different timing in seasonal sea ice retreat. Mean seawater temperature and abundances of calanoids, cyclopoids, nauplii, and appendicularians were one order of magnitude higher in summer 2014. Despite these environmental differences, biomass values of these groups proved similar for both summers. A total of ten species of copepods and one of appendicularians (Fritillaria borealis) were identified. Oithonid copepods-O. similis, followed by O. frigida-represented the bulk of mesozooplankton abundances in both summers. The highest total mesozooplankton abundance (2111 ind m(-3)) and biomass (14075 A mu g C m(-3)) were found next to an Ad,lie penguin breeding area (2014), while the highest Shannon index values were found next to a glacier in both summers. Multivariate analyses based on species abundance showed two main groups of sites, one of them encompassing all summer 2014 samplings and the other comprising all summer 2015 samplings. The positive correlation between O. similis and the 2-10 mu m Chl-a fraction suggests that summer 2014 represented optimal conditions-in terms of food-for the growth and development of this species. Experimental studies based on natural prey assemblages revealed that O. similis feeds on flagellates rather than on diatoms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000428603800007

Anthropogenic activities since the industrial revolution have increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which have in turn decreased ocean pH and altered carbonate ion concentrations: so called ocean acidification (OA). Single-species experiments have shown how OA can dramatically affect zooplankton development, physiology and skeletal mineralization status, potentially reducing their defensive function and altering their predatory and antipredatory behaviors. This means that increased OA may indirectly alter the biotic conditions by modifying trophic interactions. We investigated how OA affects the impact of a cubozoan predator on their zooplankton prey, predominantly Copepoda, Pleocyemata, Dendrobranchiata, and Amphipoda. Experimental conditions were set at either current (pCO(2) 370 latm) or end-of-the-century OA (pCO(2) 1,100 latm) scenarios, crossed in an orthogonal experimental design with the presence/absence of the cubozoan predator Carybdea rastoni. The combined effects of exposure to OA and predation by C. rastoni caused greater shifts in community structure, and greater reductions in the abundance of key taxa than would be predicted from combining the effect of each stressor in isolation. Specifically, we show that in the combined presence of OA and a cubozoan predator, populations of the most abundant member of the zooplankton community (calanoid copepods) were reduced 27% more than it would be predicted based on the effects of these stressors in isolation, suggesting that OA increases the susceptibility of plankton to predation. Our results indicate that the ecological consequences of OA may be greater than predicted from single-species experiments, and highlight the need to understand future marine global change from a community perspective.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000426506100011	28850765	
J	Hedd, A; Bertram, DF; Ryder, JL; Jones, IL								Effects of interdecadal climate variability on marine trophic interactions: rhinoceros auklets and their fish prey								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				309				263	278		10.3354/meps309263				2006	2006	This paper presents time-series information on the diet composition and breeding performance of rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata at Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, during 15 breeding seasons between 1976 and 2001. Three shifts in ocean climate occurred within British Columbia during this period (1976-77, 1989-90,1998-99), allowing us to evaluate associations between marine environmental conditions and the reproduction of this piscivorous seabird. Lipid-rich Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus was the single most important prey delivered to chicks across years (15 yr avg. 38 %; annual range 4 to 86 %). Interannual variability was high, but in general breeding performance was strongest when 0+ sand lance predominated chick diets. Other annually important prey taxa included Pacific saury Cololabis saira, juvenile rockfishes Sebastes spp., Pacific herring Clupea pallasi and juvenile salmonid Oncorhynchus spp. The dietary importance of these prey also varied seasonally. Marine environmental conditions (evaluated using sea surface temperatures, SSTs) were clearly associated with reproduction of rhinoceros auklet, as both occurrence of sand lance in the diet and the growth rates of chicks diminished as spring SSTs increased (r = -0.680, p < 0.01, and r = -0.697, p < 0.01, respectively). We hypothesized that recruitment to local sand lance populations was temperature dependent. The strong negative relationship between dietary occurrence of 0+ sand lance and spring SST (r = -0.560, p < 0.05), coupled with the lack of a similar relationship for 1+ sand lance (p > 0.20), was consistent with the temperature-dependent recruitment hypothesis. Our data suggest that SSTs could interact with population age structure to affect the recruitment dynamics of Pacific sand lance. We estimated the annual dietary importance of 0+ sand lance to rhinoceros auklets using spring SST and the importance of 0+ sand lance in the diet the previous year.									44	0	0	0	50	0	51			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000237020200022		
J	Morison, Francoise; Pierson, James Joseph; Oikonomou, Andreas; Menden-Deuer, Susanne								Mesozooplankton grazing minimally impacts phytoplankton abundance during spring in the western North Atlantic								PEERJ				8						e9430	10.7717/peerj.9430				JUL 17 2020	2020	The impacts of grazing by meso- and microzooplankton on phytoplankton primary production (PP) was investigated in the surface layer of the western North Atlantic during spring. Shipboard experiments were performed on a latitudinal transect at three stations that differed in mixed layer depth, temperature, and mesozooplankton taxonomic composition. The mesozooplankton community was numerically dominated by Calanus finmarchicus at the northern and central station, with Calanus hyperboreus also present at the northern station. The southern station was >10 degrees C warmer than the other stations and had the most diverse mesozooplankton assemblage, dominated by small copepods including Paracalanus spp. Microzooplankton grazing was detected only at the northern station, where it removed 97% of PP. Estimated clearance rates by C. hyperboreus and C. finmarchicus suggested that at in-situ abundance these mesozooplankton were not likely to have a major impact on phytoplankton abundance, unless locally aggregated. Although mesozooplankton grazing impact on total phytoplankton was minimal, these grazers completely removed the numerically scarce > 10 mu m particles, altering the particle-size spectrum. At the southern station, grazing by the whole mesozooplankton assemblage resulted in a removal of 14% of PP, and its effect on net phytoplankton growth rate was similar irrespective of ambient light. In contrast., reduction in light availability had an approximately 3-fold greater impact on net phytoplankton growth rate than mesozooplankton grazing pressure. The low mesozooplankton grazing impact across stations suggests limited mesozooplankton-mediated vertical export of phytoplankton production. The constraints provided here on trophic transfer, as well as quantitative estimates of the relative contribution of light and grazer controls of PP and of grazer-induced shifts in particle size spectra, illuminate food web dynamics and aid in parameterizing modeling-frameworks assessing global elemental fluxes and carbon export.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000549756100005	32742776

J	Schilliger, Lionel H.; Morel, Damien; Bonwitt, Jesse H.; Marquis, Olivier								CHEYLETUS ERUDITUS (TAURRUS (R)): AN EFFECTIVE CANDIDATE FOR THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF THE SNAKE MITE (OPHIONYSSUS NATRICIS)								JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE				44	3			654	659		10.1638/2012-0239R.1				SEP 2013	2013	The most commonly encountered ectoparasite in captive snakes is the hematophagous snake mite (Ophionyssus natricis). Infected snakes often exhibit lethargy, dysecdysis, pruritus, crusting dermatitis (sometimes progressing to abscesses), and behavioral changes (increased bathing time, rubbing against objects). Anemia and septicemia are occasional complications. Eliminating snake mites from a collection is frustrating. Insecticidal and acaricidal compounds used in mammals can be used against O. natricis infestation in reptiles, but they all are potentially neurotoxic to reptiles. The use of a biological agent to control the snake mite was first developed by using the predatory mites Hypoaspis miles and Hypoaspis aculeifer. However, no data are available regarding the potential of these mites to control O. natricis. Furthermore, the survival and predatory behavior of H. aculeifer and H. miles decreases above 28 degrees C, which is the lower value of the optimal temperature zone range required for rearing snakes. The aim of this study is to identify the ability of the predatory mite Cheyletus eruditus to control O. natricis. In the first experiment, 125 O. natricis mites where placed in separate plastic tubes together with the same number of C. eruditus mites. After 48 hr, the survival rate of snake mites was 6% compared with 92% in the control group (n = 125, P < 0,001). In the second experiment, 11 infested (average of 13 O. natricis per snake) ball pythons, with an average of 13 O. natricis per individual, were placed in separate cages with 1,000 C. eruditus mites + vermiculite After 15 days, only an average of two mites per snake remained, compared with 48 per snake in the control group (t-test, P < 0.01).									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1042-7260	1937-2825		WOS:000339639100029	24063093

Here we report that the algal recovery in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area did not derive from the increase in the traditional strong predators, but rather from the establishment of a previously unknown interaction between the thermophilic fish Thalassoma pavo and the seastar Marthasterias glacialis. The interaction resulted in elevated predation rates on sea urchins responsible for algal overgrazing. Manipulative experiments and field observations revealed that the proximity of the seastars triggered an escape response in sea urchins, extending their tube feet. Fishes exploited this behavior by feeding on the exposed tube feet, thus impairing urchin movement, and making them vulnerable to predation by the seastars. These findings suggest that predator diversity generated by MPA establishment can activate positive interactions among predators, with subsequent restoration of the ecosystem structure and function through cascading consumer impacts.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000358293700001	26198539	
J	Legaspi, JC; Legaspi, BC; Meagher, RL; Ciomperlik, MA								Evaluation of Serangium parcesetosum (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) as a biological control agent of the silverleaf whitefly (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae)								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				25	6			1421	1427		10.1093/ee/25.6.1421				DEC 1996	1996	The coccinellid predator from India, Serangium parcesetosum Sicard, was studied as a potential biological control agent of the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring [also known as the sweetpotato whitefly, B, tabaci (Gennadius) Biotype B]. Studies were performed on prey preference, and effects of host plant on predation, and. temperature on life-history and predation rates. In one test, the predator was offered simultaneously 5 prey choices: con; earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) eggs; tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (L.) eggs; and approximate to 200 eggs and early instars of B. argentifolii reared on poinsettias, cantaloupes, or cucumbers. S. parcesetosum did not consume any lepidopteran eggs: however, they devoured nearly all whitefly prey offered averaging approximate to 600 prey per 24-h feeding period. Mean adult longevities were 27.6 d on cantaloupe, 24.5 d on cucumber, 44.7 d on hibiscus, and 27.8 d on tomato. Each S. parcesetosum adult consumed approximate to 170-200 whitefly eggs and immatures per 12-h feeding period. The predation rate was highest on cucumbers, followed by tomato and cantaloupe, and lowest on hibiscus. Under constant temperature conditions of 20, 30, and 40 degrees C, adults survived best at 20 degrees C with a mean longevity of approximate to 75 d. Adults lived approximate to 25 d at 30 degrees C, whereas, 40 degrees C resulted in death within 3 d. Predation rate was found to increase with temperature. The mean number of total immature B. argentifolii consumed by S. parcesetosum adults was 138.9, 180.8, and 187.4 per 12-h feeding period at 20, 30, and 40 degrees C, respectively. The maximum cumulative lifetime predation was measured at >10,000 whiteflies consumed in the most long-lived individuals, despite feeding only 12 h/d at 1- to 3-d intervals. Mean cumulative lifetime predation was measured at 4,909.5, 2,586.1, and 224.9 whiteflies at 20, 30, and 40 degrees C, respectively. Because of its voracity in both immature and adult stages, and its apparent preference for whiteflies, including B. argentifolii (compared with lepidopteran eggs), S. parcesetosum is a promising biological control agent against the silverleaf whitefly.									41	5	0	0	46	0	50			0046-225X			WOS:A1996WA85400025

Its abundance in New Zealand seems to be positively correlated with availability of suspended food, negatively correlated with suspended terrigenous sediment, and not strongly correlated with degree of coastal upwelling. Substrate firmness may also be important in controlling its distribution and/or abundance. Some individuals have been observed alive in an unusual vertical orientation in crevices in rocks, but the significance of this orientation is unclear. Following its introduction into Tasmania by unknown means early in this century, M. roseus has increased dramatically in abundance, probably due to a lack of appropriate predators. In New Zealand, it is preyed upon by teleosts and starfish, whereas in Tasmania, mortality appears to be due mostly to storms. The oxygen isotopic profiles of M. roseus shells reflect seasonal temperature changes during the life of the animal. Comparison with a previous study on Turritella gonostoma from the Gulf of California suggests that M. roseus grows more slowly.									29	0	0	0	19	0	29			0042-3211			WOS:A1994NV74700004

These contrasting selection pressures explain five puzzling effects of temperature on insects: growth and development rates increase almost linearly with temperature; genetic variability in development rate is reduced at high (27 degrees C) temperatures; genetic variability in growth rate is reduced at low (15 degrees C) temperatures; development is very slow at the time of emergence after diapause, regardless of the temperature threshold for emergence; and growth is slow at low temperatures, but development is even slower.Insects use temperature to indicate time-of-season. Different species are geared differently to rising temperatures. Insect predators and parasitoids become more effective at high temperatures; and insect population dynamics are not stable in the conventional sense.									168	8	0	0	176	1	182			0008-347X			WOS:A1996UB35200001

These ecosystems are increasingly under threat from human-induced disturbances such as habitat loss and fragmentation as a consequence of ski resort development and expansion. However, limited peer-reviewed research has investigated the impacts of ski-related disturbances on wildlife, particularly on reptiles. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted reptile surveys to determine the patterns of reptile distribution and abundance in Australian ski resorts. Then, using a factorial experimental design, we investigated 1) the influence of temperature and predation in driving observed distributions and 2) how a common ski resort management practice - mowing of modified ski slopes - affected thermal regimes and rates of predation of reptiles on ski runs. We found that the removal of vegetation structural complexity through mowing resulted in significantly higher rates of predation on plasticine models, as well as significantly altered thermal regimes. Crucially, mown ski runs had higher maximum ground temperatures that frequently exceeded the recorded critical maximum body temperatures of the target species of lizards. Thus, mowing has the potential to render these areas unsuitable for thermoregulatory purposes for a large proportion of the potential activity period of reptiles. Together, modifications of the thermal environment and elevated rates of predation appear to explain the avoidance of ski runs by reptiles. To facilitate the persistence of reptiles in disturbed subalpine environments, management plans must focus on implementing strategies that reduce the impact of human activities that alter temperature regimes and predation rates on lizards.Synthesis and Applications. We suggest that the retention of structural complexity on ski runs (e.g. through the cessation of mowing during peak reptile activity periods) and/or revegetation with native plant communities will concurrently provide refuge from predators and buffer against extreme temperatures, making ski runs more hospitable to reptiles. Based on our findings, we emphasize that effective management strategies targeting subalpine biodiversity conservation require an understanding of the drivers that determine species distributions in these landscapes.We suggest that the retention of structural complexity on ski runs (e.g. through the cessation of mowing during peak reptile activity periods) and/or revegetation with native plant communities will concurrently provide refuge from predators and buffer against extreme temperatures, making ski runs more hospitable to reptiles.

In this paper we assess the effect of temperature on developmental rate and reproduction potential of T. bagdasarjani under laboratory conditions. The development of this species was determined at 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 37.5 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH and L16:D8 h photoperiod. The total developmental time averaged 28.2, 15.0, 8.9, 7.6, 7.2 and 7.4 days at 15-37.5 degrees C, respectively, when feeding on immature stages of two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. The lower developmental threshold (T-0) and thermal constant (K) for the development of this predator were estimated 9.2 degrees C and 162 degree-days by the Ikemoto linear model. The life table parameters were estimated at 15-35 degrees C. The shortest life span of females at 35 degrees C was 45.0 days, followed by 50.7, 50.9, 103.3 and 136.8 days at 30, 25, 20 and 15 degrees C, respectively. Mated females laid on average 19.9, 26.3, 41.1, 39.6 and 31.3 eggs per female at 15-35 degrees C, respectively. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and finite rate of increase (lambda) increased significantly with increasing temperature. The rm values ranged from 0.021 (15 degrees C) to 0.186 (35 degrees C) days(-1). The highest value of net reproductive rate (R-0) was 13.6 females progeny/female/generation at 25 degrees C. The results demonstrated that T. bagdasarjani is well adapted to high temperatures. However, the efficiency to control spider mites may be affected by behavioral characteristics of the predator and its prey under real conditions.									34	2	0	0	33	0	34			0168-8162			WOS:000297628300005	21533843

Four rearing experiments (9 to 10 days), using four different size fish, were conducted at four different constant temperatures (13, 16, 19, and 22 degrees C). Temperatures used in the present study were chosen according to those at the nursery ground in Wakasa Bay during spring and early summer. Fish were fed live mysids or formula feed during experiments. Fish fed live mysids showed always higher growth rates in length (1.04-2.09 times in expts. 13) and weight (1.14-2.65 times in expts. 3 and 4), better feed efficiency (1.56-4.34 times in expts. 3 and 4) than those fed formula feed at any temperatures. Chemical compositions (proximate composition and fatty acid profile) of fish at the end of experiments reflected those of diets, and those of fish fed live mysids were nearly the same as those of wild juveniles.									24	1	0	0	25	0	26			0919-9268			WOS:A1997XY69200006

Changes in the quality of algae at the base of the food web can have a cascading effect on higher trophic levels. We examined whether UV radiation altered the synthesis of fatty acids (FA) and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), as well as the C:N elemental stoichiometry of marine primary producers and whether these modifications transferred through a simple food chain (copepod, fish larvae). Two diatoms (Thalassiosira weissflogii and Thalassiosira pseudonana) and one flagellate (Dunaliella tertiolecta) were exposed to three different UV exposure treatments. Copepod nauplii were then fed with Thalassiosira pseudonana for 3 days. Fish larvae were, in turn, fed with these nauplii. C: N ratios and total lipid decreased with increasing UVexposure in the diatoms, but did not vary in copepods or fish. PAR-only-treated algae had more saturated FAs, myristic (14: 0) and palmitic acid (16: 0), while UV-treated algae had more long-chain polyunsaturated FAs. These changes did not transfer to copepods or fish larvae. No MAAs were found in either algae, copepods or fish. Our results suggest that copepods are able to compensate for lower food quality by increasing food intake.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000366936900005

Predaceous aquatic insects are key components of communities associated with seasonal ponds. Since the life cycles of these predators and their prey are unusual in that they occur at different moments of the pond hydroperiod, differences in temporal overlap could change the strength of their interactions. This study analyzed the phenology of the giant water bug Belostoma bifoveolatum and its prey. Breeding phenology, nymph population, and prey phenology were studied extensively in three wetlands during the spring season. Experimental trials were carried out to evaluate prey consumption and prey preference. The results showed a strong overlap in phenology between the water bug and the Pleurodema thaul frog. The timing of tadpole and water bug nymph hatching could ensure high survival levels of the early immature stages of this insect. As giant water bugs develop, their prey selectivity experiences a shiftolder nymphs and adults having a higher impact on tadpoles. The fluctuating climate of the Patagonian region probably influences the phenology of predator-prey assemblages in seasonal communities, and may have the potential to drive feeding performance and the strength of interspecific interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000467481500004

These reefs represent a relatively unique combination within the wider Caribbean of low coral cover and high parrotfish abundance suggesting that predation pressure could be intense. Surveys across eight shallow forereefs documented the abundance of corals, corallivorous parrotfishes, and predation scars on corals. The corals Porites porites and Porites astreoides were preyed onmost frequently with the rates of predation an order of magnitude greater than has been documented for other areas of the Caribbean. In fact, parrotfish bite density on these preferred corals was up to 34 times greater than reported for corals on other reefs worldwide. On reefs where coral cover was low and corals such as Montastraea faveolata, often preferred prey for parrotfishes, were rare, predation rates on P. porites and P. astreoides, and other less common corals, intensified further. The intensity of parrotfish predation increased significantly as coral cover decreased. However, parrotfish abundance showed only a marginal positive relationship with predation pressure on corals, likely because corallivorous parrotfish were abundant across all reefs. Parrotfishes often have significant positive impacts on coral cover by facilitating coral recruitment, survival, and growth via their grazing of algae. However, abundant corallivorous parrotfishes combined with low coral cover may result in higher predation on corals and intensify the negative impact that parrotfishes have on remaining corals.									21	0	0	0	21	0	21			0722-4028			WOS:000303449900012

The age of the animals ranged from I to 32 years. Asymptotic values for standard length and body mass were 127.7 +/- 1.6 (s.e.) cm and 69.0 +/- 2.7 kg for males (maxima: 144 cm and 92 kg) and 127.6 +/- 2.3 cm and 68.9 +/- 2.5 kg for females (maxima: 141 cm and 91 kg). All animals were sexually mature at an age >= 6 years and the ovulation rate was 0.86. Mean Age at Maturity (MAM) was 4.2 +/- 0.2 years for males and 3.5 +/- 0.3 years for females, values significantly lower than calculated for ringed seals from the same area 20 years ago. This change in MAM suggests that either the prey base for ringed seals in the area has increased or alternatively that the density of ringed seals has declined, such that more resources are available per capita. If the climate of the Arctic changes in the manner predicted by a host of climate-change scenarios, it is likely to have a strong impact on ringed seal populations in future, although there are no data to suggest that dramatic changes have taken place yet in fish and invertebrate populations in the Svalbard area. Although cause-and-effect cannot be firmly established, there is a possibility that the substantial increase in the number of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) over the past 20 years, since hunting the species in Svalbard ceased in 1973, may have played a role in the observed change in the ringed seal population.

Notwithstanding, the three social species of Stegodyphus (Eresidae) inhabit arid and semi-arid habitats with marked daily and seasonal variation in climate. The nests of the social spider Stegodyphus mimosarum Pavesi commonly occur in dry Acacia savanna in southern Africa. We investigated the abiotic conditions to which the nests of S. mimosarum are exposed and the changes in availability of potential insect prey at different times of year and over the daily cycle. We used these data to determine the:extent to which prey availability and climatic conditions explain seasonal and daily variation in the activity of the spiders. Data were collected during four sampling periods a year over two years from nests of S. mimosarum located on the Mkomazi River Bridge (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). We measured ambient and nest temperatures and in a sample of nests, spider growth rate, prey availability, foraging activity and activity on the web at night. Spiders had two periods of increased growth rate occurring in early and late summer, at times of year when ambient temperature rarely falls below 20 degrees C. Temperatures inside the nest were generally higher than ambient throughout the day and night. Foraging response, measured as the numbers of individuals responding to the vibrations of a tuning fork, was significantly higher by night than by day. In summer, foraging response decreased with increasing temperature during the day, whereas in winter, there was a positive correlation between foraging response and temperature at night. Potential prey, measured as mean numbers of insects trapped in a sample of webs, were more abundant during the day than at night, despite the fact that the spiders were most active on the web at night. Nocturnal insects, however, were larger than diurnal. ones and spiders handled significantly more large prey both during the day and at night. Correlation and partial correlation analyses indicate that ambient temperature and windspeed play a direct role in influencing foraging and other activity on the web. Nonetheless, the predominance of nocturnal activity in both summer and winter could not be explained by climatic conditions and prey availability alone. Some other factor (e.g., predation or parasitism) may be involved.									28	0	0	0	28	1	31			0161-8202			WOS:000089802200004

However, little knowledge exists on its ecology. Here we investigated the ecology of P. annandalei in an aquaculture pond in Vietnam. Temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and biomass of protozoans and copepods were monitored every other day for 1 month. Experiments on protozoan growth and grazing by P. annandalei were also conducted. Copepod fecal pellet production and temperature-dependent egg hatching rates were likewise quantified. Despite very high phytoplankton biomass, biomass of P. annandalei was surprisingly low. Copepod production was estimated from three independent methods: clearance, weight-specific egg production rate (SEP) and specific fecal pellet production rate. SEP proved to be accurate to predict the in situ population growth in the pond. A simple model for production of P. annandalei based on SEP was developed. Our study extends our knowledge of how environmental conditions in the pond may affect the population dynamics and production of copepods. The results have important implications for pond managements ensuring stable copepod production and harvest.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000509465800012

However, an animal's appearance might also evolve in response to the abiotic environment. Here, we investigate the processes that determine the appearance of silk webbing built by New Zealand's largest endemic moth Aenetus virescens (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae), whose larvae burrow into the trunks of native trees. Larvae cover tunnel entrances with silk webbing, detritus, and epiphytes, giving them a similar appearance to tree bark. First, we conducted spectral analyses of webbing and background bark in avian tetrahedral color space to test whether webbing made larvae less visible to predatory parrots. Next, we manipulated the spectral contrast of webbing and background bark and assessed its effect on predation by parrots for over 2 yr. Last, we measured the effect of webbing on tunnel temperatures and quantified how temperatures within tunnels affected larval growth. Results indicate that webbing made larvae less visible to predatory parrots. However, webbing contrast to background bark did not affect predation by parrots. Instead, webbing increased temperatures within tunnels and facilitated more rapid larval growth. Overall results indicate that the appearance of organisms that are difficult to locate visually may not always result from selection by predators.									3	0	0	0	4	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000400598500012	28247920

Although turtle life histories may have evolved with relatively high levels of nest depredation, present-day levels may be negatively impacting populations that are already declining. This degree of depredation may be problematic for species such as Alacrochelys temminekii (Alligator Snapping Turtle), which has relatively low reproductive output for a large turtle, vet little is known about depredation ofM, temminckii nests. We constructed 90 artificia1111. tenuninekii nests in 2008 and 2009 at Black Bayou Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana to identify nest predators and elucidate patterns of nest depredation. All artificial nests were depredated, with Procyon lotor (Raccoon), and Dasypus noverncinetus (Nine-banded Armadillo) being the two most common nest predators. Other predators included Lontra canadensis (Northern River Otter), Didelphis virgin iana (Virginia Opossum), and Lynx mills (Bobcat). Nest depredation is a major threat to Alligator Snapping Turtles at this site and may be limiting recruitment in this population.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000324378800003

These biomass variations are mainly attributed to predation pressure and environmental factors (e.g. advective transport). When stock size of capelin (Mallotus villosus), a major planktivorous fish in the Barents Sea ecosystem, was quite low as in 1986 and 1994, the zooplankton biomass showed marked increase. However, the increase in the zooplankton biomass occurred in different water masses during 1986 and 1994. In 1986, a climatically cold year, the plankton biomass was highest in the Arctic waters of the northeastern Barents Sea. This is probably due to the increase in larger Arctic amphipod species, such as Themisto libellula. In 1994, a climatically warm year, the zooplankton biomass was high in the Atlantic waters of the southwestern Barents Sea. The large increase in zooplankton biomass in the Atlantic waters in 1994 was presumably due to the higher inflow of advected organisms, e.g. Calanus spp., as well as high temperatures, which may lead to high growth rates of zooplankton. Throughout the studied region, the plankton biomass in the "cold year" of 1986 was generally much lower than in the "warm year" of 1994.									63	1	2	0	47	0	68			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000182464900003

Mapping of the coral reef at Darwin, herein Wellington Reef, shows it presently to be the largest known structural reef in the Galapagos. It consists of numerous 1- to 3-m-high Porites framework towers or stacks and overlies a carbonate (coral/calcareous sediments) basement. Pre-disturbance Wellington Reef was constructed chiefly by Porites lobata and Pocillopora elegans, and Wenman coral cover was dominated by Pavona clavus and Porites lobata. Subsequent surveys in 2012 have demonstrated robust recovery in spite of ENSO thermal shock events, involving both high and low stressful temperatures that have caused tissue bleaching and mortality. No losses of coral species have been observed. Radiocarbon dating of 1- to 3-m-high poritid framework stacks, from their peaks to bases, revealed modern ages of up to 690 yr. Incremental stack growth rates ranged from 0.15-0.39 to 1.04-2.40 cm yr(-1). The former are equivalent to framework accretion rates of 1.5-3.9 m Kyr(-1), the latter to coral skeletal growth rates of 1.0-2.4 cm yr(-1). Coral recovery in the central and southern Galapagos has been nonexistent to low compared with the northern islands, due chiefly to much higher population densities and destructive grazing pressure of the echinoid Eucidaris galapagensis. Thus, coral reef resistance to ENSO perturbations and recovery potential in the Galapagos are influenced by echinoid bioerosion that varies significantly among islands.									37	0	0	0	33	0	37			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000354189600006

Both partial correlation and multiple regression analyses clearly suggested that neighbour distance was the major determinant of the vigilant behaviour in the red-billed chough, even though group size would also exert a certain influence. As no significant correlation between the two variables was found, it can be assumed that the relationship between vigilance and neighbour distance is not spurious. Feeding frequencies were not significantly correlated with the other variables, except for temperature, for which a positive correlation was observed. Since the red-billed chough usually feeds on insects, which become more active and available as temperature increases, we suggest that the feeding frequency of the red-billed chough mostly depends on food availability. Our results are discussed in the framework of the hypotheses put forward to explain vigilance behaviour. The conclusion is that the 'individual risk hypothesis' explains the behaviour of the red-billed chough better than the 'many eyes hypothesis'.									33	2	0	0	30	0	36			0952-8369			WOS:000168348900007

This creek provides habitat for endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha) and invasive brown trout (Salmo trutta). We assess how increased flow may alter habitat and how that change may impact native and nonnative species using physical habitat modeling and statistical analysis of stream temperature data. We used System for Environmental Flow Analysis to calculate the change in habitat area for both species in the lower 2.1km of the creek before and after the increased flow. Results indicate a slight increase in available habitat for juveniles of both species and a slight decrease for spawning brown trout. We used regression modeling to relate daily average air temperature to stream temperature and periods of increased discharge during water system maintenance were used to model the temperatures during likely future conditions. Both high and low stream temperature were dampened due to the added water resulting in fewer days with suitable spawning temperature and more days with suitable growth temperature for humpback chub. Fewer suitable days for growth upstream but more suitable days downstream, were predicted for brown trout. Compared to other streams that sustain populations of humpback chub, flow conditions for Bright Angel Creek provide fewer days throughout the year with suitable temperatures, particularly during the winter months. Juvenile humpback chub rearing may improve through the restoration of flow however the presence of predatory brown trout complicates the net beneficial impact.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000468237500002	30972428

This model is based on relatively universal model formulations and is intended to be a first submodel for a more complete model of the river ecosystem and the biogeochemical processes in the river.3. The model was tested for the River Sihl in Switzerland. To take advantage of prior knowledge of model parameters, to account for their non-identifiability given the measured data, and to consider uncertainty of model parameters and results, Bayesian inference was used to update the prior probability distribution of the model parameters.4. The calibrated model showed very good agreement of model results with measured data. None of the posterior parameter marginals showed a conflict with the prior. Some posterior marginals (specific growth rates of the functional groups, specific death rates, parameters characterizing self- and mutual shading of algae, and the critical level of discharge for catastrophic loss) were significantly narrower than the priors, indicating considerable gain of information from the measurements. For other parameters (half-saturation concentrations of algae and invertebrate growth, parameters characterizing temperature dependence of invertebrate growth rates, colonization rates and most coefficients of catastrophic loss), no significant information could be gained from the data. This clearly demonstrated the need for a Bayesian analysis.5. The model seems to be a promising step towards a more comprehensive model of the river ecosystem and the biogeochemical processes in the river. However, more efforts are required: In particular, extension of the model by a description of the dynamics of benthic biofilms and nutrient dynamics and application of the (extended) model to more rivers to learn about the dependence of model parameters on river characteristics. The difficulty of finding adequate data sets for testing such and extended models demonstrates the need for comprehensive measurement campaigns that get information of periphyton, benthic invertebrates, benthic biofilms, suspended and sedimented organic particles, suspended organisms and nutrient concentrations and transformation rates in the water column.									10	1	0	0	7	0	10			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000256377000008		
J	Bergstrom, C. A.; Whiteley, A. R.; Tallmon, D. A.								The heritable basis and cost of colour plasticity in coastrange sculpins								JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				25	12			2526	2536		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02624.x				DEC 2012	2012	Both genetic and plastic traits contribute to adaptation in novel environments. Phenotypic plasticity can facilitate adaptation by allowing for existence in a wider range of conditions and a faster response to environmental change than gene-based selection. Coastrange sculpins (Cottus aleuticus) colonize new and variable streams arising in the wake of receding glaciers in south-east Alaska, and substrate-matching plasticity may enhance colonization success by reducing detection by visual predators. As part of a long-term study of the fitness consequences of colour plasticity and its capacity to respond to both positive and negative selection, we investigated whether it is heritable and costly. We raised full-sib broods of sculpins in the laboratory: one half of each brood was raised in white containers, the other half in black. After 4 months, we digitally analysed their colour and found significant but weak heritability in both baseline colour and colour plasticity. To investigate the cost of colour plasticity, we compared the growth and mortality rates of juvenile sculpins reared under constant substrate colours to those reared on substrates that changed colour frequently, and compared growth rates among sculpin that differed in their colour change ability. We found evidence of small costs of plasticity, consistent with other studies of natural populations. Evidence of heritable genetic variation for plasticity and small costs to its maintenance and expression contributes to explanations of how plasticity is variable and persistent among wild populations and underscores its ability to respond both positively and negatively to selection in variable habitats.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000311296500013	23163329

The timing, duration and strength of juvenile settlement varied between years and were positively correlated with the duration and quantity of egg production. Otolith increment counts were used to determine the age and metamorphosis and/or settlement dates of fish and to compare settlement patterns inferred from catch data with those inferred from age data. The catch data suggested two 'pulses' of settlement in Port Erin Bay whereas the otolith age data indicated three main settlement events. Over the years the first sub-cohort was generally the largest and overall this sub-cohort suffered the highest mortality. This first sub-cohort may have a "high risk" strategy and swamp potential predators early in the settlement period, with the result that the second sub-cohort generally has faster growth rate and lower mortality. A release of predatory pressure on the second sub-cohort could be a cause of large year classes in plaice populations. Growth rates were lowest for fish in the first sub-cohort, likely reflecting density-dependent effects and less optimal environmental conditions early in the year. The variations in instantaneous mortality rate between sub-cohorts, as well as inter-annually within sub-cohorts, illustrate the complex dynamics in the structure of these juvenile plaice populations on the nursery grounds. Global environment change effects are visible in the wider Irish Sea plaice population dynamics, with temperature dependent nursery ground processes as one of the contributing mechanisms.

J	Loman, J								Temperature, genetic and hydroperiod effects on metamorphosis of brown frogs Rana arvalis and R-temporaria in the field								JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				258				115	129		10.1017/S0952836902001255				SEP 2002	2002	Time for metamorphosis and metamorph size of moor frogs Rana arvalis and common frogs R. temporaria were measured in 22 ponds for 1-8 years. Environmental data in these ponds were also measured. Metamorphosis of the frogs took place from the beginning of June to the beginning of August. When both species were found in one pond, the common frogs metamorphosed up to 20 days earlier than the moor frogs. Most variation in time for metamorphosis, among ponds and years, is explained by temperature effects, but a causal relationship was not established. Within a pond, metamorphosis was later in cold summers than in warm summers. Size at metamorphosis was affected by tadpole density; at high densities metamorphs were smaller. Size at metamorphosis was not related to time for metamorphosis. There was an effect of pond drying; if ponds were about to dry up, metamorphosis was accelerated by about 2.4 days. Tadpoles from ponds with a late metamorphosis in the field had tadpoles that metamorphosed early in a common garden experiment, suggesting counter gradient selection.									54	3	2	0	59	2	63			0952-8369			WOS:000178186500012

Location Fifteen reef locations between 34 degrees N and 27 degrees S in the Western Atlantic. Time period 2011-2014. Major taxa studied Reef fishes. Methods We quantified fish feeding pressure on the benthos across 61 degrees of latitude in the Western Atlantic via 1,038 10 min videos of 2 m(2) reef areas, where every fish feeding on the benthos was identified, had its total length estimated, and the number of bites on the reef substratum was counted. Fish were assigned to functional groups based on diet and feeding modes. Benthic cover estimates were also obtained through visual assessments from the videos. Results We documented feeding rates that were 2- to 22-fold higher in tropical versus extratropical locations. This pattern was driven mainly by an interaction between fish functional group and temperature, with herbivory dominating in tropical regions (c. 20-fold higher), shifting to omnivory in temperate regions of both Hemispheres. Feeding by invertivores was common across all latitudes. Consumer species composition differed between Northern and Southern Hemispheres, but functional groups were similar, and their feeding changed in a similar manner with temperature regardless of Hemisphere. Main conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that biotic interactions, especially plant-herbivore interactions, are more intense in the tropics. These findings help to explain the lower palatability of tropical versus extratropical seaweeds and suggest that herbivory is favoured in warm conditions but omnivory in colder waters. The functional approach indicated that factors associated with latitude or temperature have selected for similar feeding functions among the different species occupying these geographical regions. Understanding the shifting trophic interactions across latitudes might help to predict the impacts of global changes on ecosystem function as tropical species move polewards and contact temperate systems.									14	0	0	0	12	0	14			1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000457789900004		
J	Reiley, Bryan M.; Benson, Thomas J.; Everitts, Jeremy; Bednarz, James C.								Does flooding effect the apparent survival and body condition of a ground foraging migrant passerine?								PLOS ONE				12	4					e0175179	10.1371/journal.pone.0175179				APR 10 2017	2017	Natural disturbances play a fundamental role in maintaining habitat and landscape heterogeneity; however, these events can also have negative effects on some species. While we know that disturbances can reduce habitat quality for many species, leading to diminished populations and altered community structure, the effect of these events on individuals that continue to occupy affected areas remains unknown. We focused on understanding the impact of flood-mediated reduction of habitat quality on Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii). In 2008, a catastrophic flood event occurred on the Mississippi River and its tributaries, severely affecting one of two locations where we had studied territorial males since 2004. To determine the impact of flooding on this species, we evaluated how body condition and apparent survival of males differed between locations and in pre-flood (2004-2007) and post-flood (2008-2010) periods. Body condition did not differ between locations after the flood, suggesting that flooding did not cause food limitation for this obligate ground forager. Apparent survival in the post-flood period was lower at both locations and led to near population extirpation at the heavily flood-impacted site. Overall, this study demonstrates the vulnerability of species to extreme hydrological events, an increasing threat due to climate change. Future research should focus on identifying species that are vulnerable to these events and determining appropriate conservation strategies. Conservation for the Swainson's Warbler should focus on identifying and conserving the highest elevation, least flood prone areas within bottomland hardwood forests and managing those areas for thick understory vegetation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000399954800020	28394910	
J	Snover, Melissa L.								Ontogenetic habitat shifts in marine organisms: Influencing factors and the impact of climate variability								BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE				83	1			53	67						JUL 2008	2008	Many marine animals must increase by several orders of magnitude in size as they grow from eggs or larvae to adults, and ecological scaling properties limit the size range over which certain habitats are exploitable. Many of these organisms therefore undergo one or more ontogenetic habitat shifts as they grow to maximize growth rates while minimizing predation risk. An understanding of the mechanisms that influence the timing and optimal sizes at these shifts is critical in managing both target and by-catch populations affected by fisheries. Here I summarize ecological processes that influence ontogenetic habitat shifts, including size-specific predation, size-specific limitations to habitat exploitation, and density dependence. I also consider how climate change may affect the variability in these processes. To illustrate the potential impact of climate variability, I present a simple model building on previous theoretical studies of ontogenetic habitat shifts. As a case study, I used the model to consider differences in the timing of the shift from pelagic to neritic habitats in populations of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta Linnaeus, 1758), which are vulnerable to by-catch in different fisheries in the two habitats. Results of the model suggest that the optimal size at the pelagic-to-neritic habitat shift in loggerhead sea turtles may vary considerably over time. Generalizing these results, we must place our understanding of ontogenetic habitat shifts in the context of climate variability and recognize that the results of short-term observations and experiments may not be applicable at longer time scales.					6th William R and Lenore Mote International Symposium in Fisheries Ecology6th William R and Lenore Mote International Symposium in Fisheries Ecology	NOV 14-16, 2006NOV 14-16, 2006		Sarasota, FLSarasota, FL	37	0	0	0	36	0	38			0007-4977	1553-6955		WOS:000259110100004

To determine factors affecting White Perch abundance and size structure, we compared White Perch growth, timing of maturity, and trophic level; the abundance of a predator (Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides); the abundance of an ecologically significant mid-level omnivore (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum); prey availability (chironomid and zooplankton abundances); and environmental variables (specific conductivity, Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen concentration, and temperature) among four reservoirs (two with high White Perch abundance and two with low abundance). White Perch size structure was closely tied to abundance, with truncated size structure as abundance increased. Among the other variables we tested, only Largemouth Bass abundance had a significant (negative) relationship with White Perch abundance. White Perch size structure appeared to be highly density dependent, and variables that commonly explain variation in abundance of introduced fishes did not explain differences in the four White Perch populations we studied. Further study of the competitive and predatory interactions of White Perch and Largemouth Bass over ontogeny could shed light on the mechanism(s) potentially shaping population structure of the two species where they coexist.

We examined factors that potentially influence timing of migration and migratory propensity in a wild population of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) by combining experimental manipulations with passive integrated transponder telemetry. Individuals were subjected to one of six manipulations: three designed to mimic natural stressors (temperature increase, food deprivation, and chase by a simulated predator), an injection of exogenous cortisol designed to mimic an extreme physiological challenge, a sham injection, and a control group. By measuring length and mass of 923 individuals prior to manipulation and by monitoring tagged individuals as they left the stream months later, we assessed whether preexisting differences influenced migratory tendency and timing of migration, and whether our manipulations affected growth, condition, and timing of migration. We found that pre-existing differences predicted migration, with smaller individuals and individuals in poor condition having a higher propensity to migrate. Exogenous cortisol manipulation had the largest negative effect on growth and condition, and resulted in an earlier migration date. Additionally, low-growth individuals within the temperature and food deprivation treatments migrated earlier. By demonstrating that both pre-existing differences in organism state and additional stressors can affect whether and when individuals migrate, we highlight the importance of understanding individual differences in partial migration. These effects may carry over to influence migration success and affect the evolutionary dynamics of sub-populations experiencing different levels of stress, which is particularly relevant in a changing world.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000403483100008	28488214

It can replace Brachionus plicatilis and Artemis nauplii as live diet during the protozoeal and mysis feeding stage. This study tried to determine the different optimum culture conditions for T. tetrathele, and to evaluate its application in the hatchery production of different penaeid species. Tetraselmis tetrathele was cultured at combinations of six levels of salinities (10-60 g kg(-1)), nine levels of pH (3-10.5), and two temperatures (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) in a three factorial combination experiment, Effects of varying concentrations of different organic and inorganic media including the use of vitamins and trace metals were also assessed. The dietary value of I tetrathele was evaluated by feeding it to different shrimp larvae from protozoea-1 (PZ-l) until postlarva-1 (PL-1).There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the growth of T. tetrathele at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C in acidic media; but, there were significant differences (P<0.05) in the range favoring fast growth at 25 degrees C. For the inorganic media test, the optimum concentration for the maximum growth rate of T. tetrathele was at 1 g kg(-1) of Yashima medium without urea (k=0.57). The growth rate for the other media was highly variable with some approximating the optimum. For inorganic nutrients, the optimum concentration for maximum growth was at 4 g kg(-1) of unsterilized 'bio-conversion' medium with 30 mg l(-1) of Clewat-32 (k=0.72). The other growth rates also indicated significant positive rates but were far from the optimum.The combination of T. tetrathele and Chaetoceros gracilis or C. calcitrans could be used as the only diet from protozoea-1 (PZ-I) until postlarva-1 (PL-1) for Metapenaeus ensis, Metapenaeopsis barbata, Trachypenaeus curvirostris, Penaeus indicus, P. merguiensis, P. latisulcatus, and P. japonicus, with high survival rates. However, the larvae of P. semisulcatus, P. monodon and P. chinensis can benefit from a pure phytoplanton diet until the second mysis stage (M-2) only. Beyond this stage, the larvae need bigger zooplankton as live feed.

Rana sierrae is adapted to high-elevation, fishless habitats. Its adaptions are reflected in a unique life cycle that involves a flexible, extended juvenile phase due to the short growing season typical of its alpine habitat. However, today this species is critically endangered, and most populations have been extirpated from their native range. Here, we present an 18-yr-long demographic study of a R. sierrae population in 15 lakes at Dusy Basin in Kings Canyon National Park. We focused on the period leading up to the arrival of the pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and the subsequent local extinction of R. sierrae. We used N-mixture abundance modeling, which accounts for detection probabilities, to quantify factors affecting frog abundance at different life stages. The abundance of subadult and adult frogs was negatively associated with the presence of introduced trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss and O. aquabonita). Frog abundance in all life stages was positively associated with lake surface area. The propensity of lakes drying correlated negatively with abundance of eggs, subadults, and adults in the following year. Moreover, drought years, characterized by longer summers and less winter snowpack, led to higher rates of lakes drying. Finally, our results suggest that the frequency of such droughts in the region has increased since 1937. Increased frequency or severity of droughts is expected to decrease the value of shallow lakes for Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs because these habitats are prone to drying. We discuss our results in terms of future restoration strategies, including reintroduction and probiotic treatment, in this changed and changing ecosystem.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2150-8925			WOS:000512727700042

There was no difference among aphid clones in development rate, but they did differ in fecundity. Both development rate and fecundity were influenced by temperature, but all clones showed similar responses to the changes in temperature (i.e. the interaction term was nonsignificant). However, there were significant differences among clones in susceptibility to the pathogen, and this was influenced by temperature. Furthermore, the clones differed in how temperature influenced susceptibility, with susceptibility rankings changing with temperature. Two clones showed changes in susceptibility which mirrored changes in the in vitro vegetative growth rate of E. neoaphidis at different temperatures, whereas two other clones differed considerably from this expected response. Such interactions between genotype and temperature may help maintain heritable variation in aphid susceptibility to fungal pathogen attack and have implications for our understanding of disease dynamics in natural populations. This study also highlights the difficulties of drawing conclusions about the efficacy of a biological control agent when only a restricted range of pest genotypes or environmental conditions are considered.									37	0	0	0	34	1	38			0307-6962	1365-3032		WOS:000183310800002

Effects of contrasting diets and temperatures on reproduction and prey consumption by Proprioseiopsis asetus (Acari : Phytoseiidae)								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				44	1			11	26		10.1007/s10493-008-9130-5				JAN 2008	2008	Proprioseiopsis asetus (Chant) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a relatively unknown predacious mite with potential as a biological control agent of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). In this study, the developmental rate and other biological parameters of P. asetus were investigated. Development of P. asetus was temperature dependent from 10 to 40 degrees C. Nonlinear models were fitted to development rate (1/time) data from egg to adult and by sex to estimate development times. The model of Sharpe and De Michele (1977) best fits the developmental data. The shortest development time on cattail (Typha latifolia (L.)) pollen occurred at 35 degrees C for all stages except for the egg stage, for which it was longer. The optimum development time at 35 degrees C is above the temperature optimum of most phytoseiid mites. Fecundity increased when P. asetus mated more than once. Males were needed at all times for maximum oviposition, although their consumption was negligible. Oviposition, prey killed (Franklinella occidentalis or T. urticae) and longevity of P. asetus females were recorded in the presence of males. Egg production increased with number of prey killed and P. asetus has the characteristics of successful predators of thrips.									8	3	0	0	10	2	14			0168-8162			WOS:000253199900002	18247141

Egg clutches laid on artificial substratum were quantified on a bi-weekly basis during the consecutive spawning seasons of 1994/95 and 1995/96. The timing of egg production was similar for both groups and showed a distinctly semi-lunar pattern. The majority of the larvae hatched during the period when flood tide occurred 2 h either side of sunset. At Ningaloo this only happens during neap tides when the tidal amplitude is at its minimum. However, this means that larvae are dispersed nocturnally when the risk of predation is minimal. No relationship was found between egg production and changes in water temperature. Spawning ended prematurely for 1 of these groups of fish following the passing of a tropical cyclone within 80 km of the coast. Larval supply of P. vaiuli was estimated in the vicinity of the reproductive sites by capturing pre-settlement fish at one of these locations (Tantabiddy), and post-settlement fish at the other (Bundegi). The arrival of P. vaiuli larvae to Tantabiddy was on a lunar cycle with periodicities between 28 to 30 d. When these larval supply data were lagged by the average pelagic duration of 22 d, and then cross-correlated with the spawning data, there was a weak relationship. At Bundegi, 1 constructed recruitment patterns and estimated the birth dates of juveniles, using otolith analysis. By back-calculating the birth dates of individual fish that settled at Bundegi I made 2 discoveries. Firstly, most juveniles from 1994/95 hatched when spawning output at Bundegi was low, and secondly, more than 50 % of fish caught in 1995/96 hatched after the spawning season had ended prematurely. This suggests that many of the juvenile P. vaiuli that settled at Bundegi during the second summer were not produced by this population but from elsewhere. I discuss the likelihood that larvae arriving to Ningaloo are from adult populations which inhabit fringing reefs to the north and that the observed patterns in larval supply are the result of an interaction between both physical and behavioural processes.									10	0	0	0	10	0	11			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000177007100020

Although correlative models can predict environmental suitability at a coarse scale, they often neglect short-term climatic variability, instead relying on long-term averages. Accurately projecting the fate of any particular introduction requires demographic data on how a population responds to a novel environment. The recent introduction of watersnakes (genus Nerodia) poses a risk to California's already imperiled aquatic vertebrate fauna. Despite inhabiting a seemingly suitable climate, a non-native Nerodia sipedon population in central California is likely to have been affected by a prolonged extreme drought from 2012 to 2015. We studied the only known population of N. sipedon in California for 3 years from 2013 to 2015, and estimated its abundance and annual survival. Its abundance declined from a peak of 218 (95% Credible Interval 149-313) in August 2013 to 97 (80-119) in July 2015. Annual survival of N. sipedon from 2013 to 2014 (0.23, 0.13-0.39) and from 2014 to 2015 (0.29, 0.18-0.41) was lower than survival estimates reported from native populations. Snake body condition, the abundance of large adult females, and prey availability all declined throughout the study. We conclude that the population of N. sipedon declined from 2013 to 2015, likely due to decreasing habitat and prey availability from the prolonged regional drought. This study highlights the importance of the effect of climatic extremes on the trajectory of introduced populations in a novel environment.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000411148400008

Overfishing of herbivores, anthropogenic eutrophication, and interactions between these factors have been postulated as causes, but long-term tests of these factors are uncommon. We factorially manipulated herbivorous fishes and nutrients at a depth of 16 to 18 m for 7 to 10 mo in 2 experiments over 2 yr. Herbivore exclusion increased algal cover by about 4 to 10x, algal biomass by 4 to 6x, and suppressed cover of crustose coralline algae by 80 to 100%. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on the cover or mass of upright algae, but altered species composition by suppressing cyanobacteria and facilitating red macroalgae in the absence of herbivores. Nutrient addition increased macroalgal species richness in the absence, but not the presence of herbivores. Feeding by herbivorous fishes increased by 3 to 13x on nutrient-enriched vs. control plots. This herbivory facilitated cover of crustose coralline algae, demonstrated that herbivores selectively target more nutritional prey, and suggested that herbivores could suppress macrophyte accumulation at sites with increased nutrient availability. Effects of fishes and nutrients on corals varied as a function of coral species. For the branching coral Porites porites, 56% of individuals exposed to fishes were completely consumed; however, individuals that survived grew 60 to 80% more in the presence of fishes. For Porites astreoides, exposure to fishes did not affect mortality, but increased net growth by 3 to 4 times. For this coral, nutrient addition decreased growth when exposed to fishes but not when protected from fishes, suggesting that fishes may have fed more on nutrient-enriched corals.									67	0	0	0	66	0	68			0171-8630			WOS:000270673100006

Survival and growth of the Caribbean scallops, Argopecten nucleus and Nodipecten nodosus, in suspended systems at different culture depths and net replacement frequencies								AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS				11				537	549		10.3354/aei00334				2019	2019	Survival of the Caribbean scallops Argopecten nucleus and Nodipecten nodosus in suspended culture is relatively low. The effects of culture depth and frequency of net replacement on survival and growth of both scallops were assessed, in addition to the effects on the amount of biofouling and presence of predators in the culture systems. Hatchery-produced juveniles were kept in pearl nets suspended at 3 different culture depths (6, 9 and 12 m) with 2 frequencies for net replacement (i.e. monthly and every second month, hereafter 'bimonthly'). Survival of both scallop species was higher at 12 m depth. A. nucleus also showed higher growth rates at 12 m depth, while N. nodosus exhibited higher growth rates at 6 m depth. A. nucleus and N. nodosus performed best under monthly and bimonthly net replacement schemes, respectively. Frequency of presence and size of cymatid predators did not differ between treatments, but greater frequency and size of portunids occurred at bimonthly net replacement in A. nucleus culture nets. In most months, the biofouling dry biomass in the pearl nets was higher in those maintained at a depth of 6 m with bimonthly net replacement. The results indicate that the survival of both scallops could be improved by maintaining the culture systems suspended at a depth of 12 m, under lower temperature conditions, and applying a monthly net replacement scheme in A. nucleus in order to minimize the biofouling on the nets and a bimonthly scheme in N. nodosus in order to minimize scallop perturbation associated with net replacement.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1869-215X	1869-7534		WOS:000494646700001

The effects of variability in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) spawning behavior and sex/maturity stage distribution on Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chick growth: A modeling study								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY				57	7-8			543	558		10.1016/j.dsr2.2009.10.005				APR 2010	2010	Factors that control variability in energy density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations, and the consequences of this variability for growth and fledging mass of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks, were investigated using an individual-based energetics model. Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adelie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adelie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adelie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adelie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density.

While top-down effects would increase with resource availability to plants, bottom-up effects would be stronger under low predator abundance. These predictions, however, have rarely been tested at contrasting sites while keeping the dominant plant species unchanged. Furthermore, few studies have factorially manipulated both types of forces in forest communities. For two years, we evaluated the effects of fertiliser (NPK) addition and bird exclusion on tree growth, leaf traits, insect abundance, and folivory rates in a dry/warm and a wet/cold Nothofagus pumilio forest in Patagonia, Argentina. Overall, We found no interaction between nutrient Supply and bird predation, although the strength of bottom-up and top-down forces differed markedly between forest sites. Treatment effects were generally weak in the wet forest, where tree growth rates and insect herbivory were low relative to the dry forest. In the dry forest, fertilisation increased sapling growth, insect abundance and folivory, whereas bird exclusion increased leaf damage and reduced tree growth. In the wet forest, fertilisation enhanced leaf nutrient contents and folivore abundance but not sapling growth, while bird exclusion had little impact oil insects or trees. These results imply that factors other than nutrients and birds were important in controlling tree growth and folivore activity in the wet forest. While treatment effect sizes varied widely among feeding guilds, in general, nutrient effects oil folivores were stronger than predator effects. We conclude that, within the time-Frame of this study, tree growth and herbivory were additively affected by soil nutrients and predator presence, as bird exclusion effects did not change with elevated folivore activity on fertilised trees. We also show that both top-down and bottom-up cascades were weaker in a forest site characterised by slow-growing juvenile trees subjected to low folivore pressure.									19	1	0	0	19	2	20			0030-1299			WOS:000275557500016		
J	Robinson, CT; Kawecka, B								Benthic diatoms of an Alpine stream/lake network in Switzerland								AQUATIC SCIENCES				67	4			492	506		10.1007/s00027-005-0783-4				DEC 2005	2005	We compared the benthic diatom composition of lakes, and lake inlet and outlet streams in a high elevation catchment (similar to 2600 m a.s.l.) in the Swiss Alps. The catchment consisted of a southern basin mostly fed by glacial-melt water and a northern basin fed by snowmelt and groundwater. Streams in both basins flowed through a series of small lakes before converging into a lake with a primary outlet channel. The south basin had on average 4 degrees C cooler water temperatures and 2x higher nitrate-N levels (up to 300 mu g/L) than the north basin. In contrast, the north basin had higher levels (2-4x) of particulate-P, particulate-N, and particulate organic matter than the south basin. A total of 109 and 143 diatom species was identified in lakes and streams, respectively, with a similar number of species found in each basin. Aulacoseira alpigena and Achnanthidium minutissimum were common benthic algae in north basin lakes, whereas Achnanthes subatomoides, Achnanthes marginulata, Pinnularia microstauron, and Psammothidium helveticum were most common in south basin lakes. One disconnected lake in the north basin had an assemblage dominated by Tabellaria flocculosa (66%) and Eunotia tenella (14%). Principal components analysis showed a clear separation between the north and south basins in lotic diatoms. Of the 10 most common species, streams in the south basin had greater abundances of Psammothidium helveticum, Achnanthes helvetica var. minor, Achnanthes marginulata, Achnanthes subatomoides, and Diatoma mesodon than the north basin, whereas north basin streams had higher abundances of Achnanthidium minutissimum, Aulacoseira alpigena, and Luticola goeppertiana. Lake outlet assemblages were similar to respective downstream lake inlet assemblages, and assemblages changed in composition along each basins longitudinal flow path. However, Aulacoseira alpigena had higher average abundances in north basin outlets than inlets, and Achnanthidium minutissimum, Psammothidium helveticum, and Achnanthes helvetica var. minor had higher average abundances in south basin outlets than inlets. In contrast, Diatoma mesodon, Fragilaria capucina, and Gomphonema parvulum had higher average abundances in south basin inlets than outlets. The spatial patterns in species composition reflected the hierarchical interaction of landscape features (geology, hydrology) on longitudinal gradients (lake position) in the stream/lake network.									39	2	1	0	35	0	46			1015-1621	1420-9055		WOS:000233867700010		
J	YOUNG, BE								THE EFFECTS OF FOOD, NEST PREDATION AND WEATHER ON THE TIMING OF BREEDING IN TROPICAL HOUSE WRENS								CONDOR				96	2			341	353		10.2307/1369319				MAY 1994	1994	I tested three hypotheses that could explain variation in the timing of breeding in populations of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) at four sites in Costa Rica. The sites were located at 200-1,500 m elevation on both sides and on top of the central mountain range, and had climates differing in temperature, the severity of the dry season, and total rainfall. For the first hypothesis, that breeding is timed to coincide with peaks in food availability, I monitored the monthly abundance of arthropod prey and wren clutch initiations at the four sites. Cross-correlation analysis showed that at three sites, wrens initiated clutches several months prior to when prey levels were high. Indeed, breeding began when prey levels were at their annual low. At the fourth site, prey levels varied little throughout the year and House Wrens nested nearly year round. These results indicate that sufficient food to produce eggs or feed nestlings may have been available throughout the year. Breeding appeared to be timed so that juvenile dispersal and molt occurred when food was most plentiful. The second hypothesis, that breeding is timed to avoid seasons when nest predation is high, was not supported because the rate of nest predation did not vary temporally. The third hypothesis, that breeding is timed to avoid climatic events that can increase the physiological costs of reproduction, was not supported at the three lower elevation sites. Clutch initiation at the highest site, however, did not commence until the early dry season wind and mist subsided. The termination of breeding was not correlated with climatic changes at any of the sites. Thus reproduction in tropical House Wrens seems generally to be timed to facilitate post-breeding activities, not activities associated with nesting itself.									55	0	0	0	52	2	56			0010-5422	1938-5129		WOS:A1994NN82300007

Temperature, salinity and prey availability shape the marine migration of Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, in a macrotidal estuary								MARINE BIOLOGY				159	8			1633	1646		10.1007/s00227-012-1949-y				AUG 2012	2012	The influence of salinity, temperature and prey availability on the marine migration of anadromous fishes was determined by describing the movements, habitat use and feeding behaviours of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). The objectives were to determine whether char are restricted to the upper water column of the inter-/subtidal zones due to warmer temperatures. Twenty-seven char were tracked with acoustic temperature/pressure (depth) transmitters from June to September, 2008/2009, in inner Frobisher Bay, Canada. Most detections were in surface waters (0-3 m). Inter-/subtidal movements and consecutive repetitive dives (maximum 52.8 m) resulted in extreme body temperature shifts (-0.2-18.1 A degrees C). Approximately half of intertidal and subtidal detections were between 9-13 A degrees C and 1-3 A degrees C, respectively. Stomach contents and deep diving suggested feeding in both inter-/subtidal zones. We suggest that char tolerate cold water at depth to capture prey in the subtidal zone, then seek warmer water to enhance feeding/digestion physiology.									26	0	0	0	26	0	28			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000306731300001

Environmental heterogeneity may strongly influence the spatial distribution, habitat use and refuge availability for these taxa. Using a series of 24-h mesocosm experiments we examined the predator-prey interactions between an invasive crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and four amphipod taxa, one indigenous (Gammarus pulex) and three non-native species (Crangonyx pseudogracilis, Dikerogammarus villosusandGammarus tigrinus) to Great Britain.The potential mediating effect of physical habitat on predator-prey interactions was examined via the use of different substrate particle sizes; cobbles, gravels and, sand. Survivorship of amphipods in response to crayfish predation varied significantly with the highest rates recorded for the non-native speciesD. villosus, followed byG. tigrinus, andC. pseudogracilis, with the lowest survivorship recorded for the indigenous speciesG. pulexfor all substrates except cobble. However, total biomass consumption of the indigenousG. pulexand the non-nativeD. villosusbyP. leniusculuswere similar suggesting that crayfish may have been satiated by largerD. villosusindividuals. Substrate size had a significant influence on the predation success ofP. leniusculus,with larger substrate clasts typically resulting in increased survivorship rates for all species exceptC. pseudogracilis,which displayed lower predation rates for sand substrates. The findings of this study highlight the risks that naive indigenous taxa may face from new invasive species and the importance of characterising physical habitat (complexity and refugia potential) when considering the potential ecological effects of invaders on predation success.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000541083500001

However, acclimation often has costs, and increased performance in some traits may be associated with reduced performance in other traits due to trade-offs. We investigated effects of thermal acclimation on predation, reproduction, starvation tolerance, and locomotor activity in the predatory mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer Canestrini at 10, 15, and 20 degrees C after seven days of exposure to either of the same three temperatures, following rearing at 20 degrees C. To test for effects of cold acclimation on cold tolerance, another set of mites were acclimated at each of the three temperatures over four days including an additional group at 5 degrees C, and survival was assayed following a 24 h exposure to -2 degrees C. Our results showed highest cold-and starvation tolerance but lowest predation and reproduction across test temperatures in mites acclimated to 10 degrees C. These relationships were intermediate after 15 degrees C acclimation and opposite after 20 degrees C acclimation. Locomotor activity was unaffected by acclimation temperature. Since predation and reproduction of G. aculeifer are lowered across temperatures after cold acclimation, we recommend keeping cultures at 20 degrees C without cold exposure until release in the field when used against heavy pest infestations. However, if using G. aculeifer to keep small infestations minimized, we recommend using cold acclimated mites that better tolerate low temperature and low prey availability. Such thermal and metabolic robustness could be advantageous if predatory control agents are introduced in agroecosystems in early spring to prevent establishment of pest populations.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000411473000020

Understanding its spatial ecology in invaded ecosystems can provide information to interpret and contrast its ecological impact. We opportunistically used capture points of brook trout gillnetted during an eradication campaign to assess the distribution patterns of four unexploited populations inhabiting high-altitude lakes. The main eradication method implies the use of many gillnets with several mesh sizes, which are selective for different fish sizes. For each lake we drew six capture maps associated with as many different mesh sizes, and we tested whether the distance from the coastline (which in alpine lakes is a reliable proxy of the most important spatial gradients, e.g. depth, temperature, prey availability, lighting conditions) influences the proportion of captured fish belonging to different size classes and the number of fish captured by the nets with different mesh sizes. To interpret the results, we also provide a cartographic description of the lakes' bathymetry and littoral microhabitats. We found (1) a negative relationship between brook trout distribution and the distance from the coastline in all of the size classes, lakes and mesh sizes; (2) that large brook trout can thrive in the lakes' center, while small ones are limited to the littoral areas; and (3) that the distance from the coastline alone cannot explain all the differences in the catch densities in different parts of the lakes. As in their native range, introduced brook trout populations also have littoral habits. Microhabitats, prey availability and distance from the spawning ground are other likely factors determining the distribution patterns of brook trout populations introduced in alpine lakes. The obtained results also provide useful information on how to plan new eradication campaigns.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			2475-0263			WOS:000407954100008

Temperature had a significant and positive effect on the time to egg hatch of Ap. obliterata. The duration of the larval instars was not affected by prey species at 15 degrees C but was significantly shorter, 12.1 days at 20 degrees C compared with 21.1 days at 15 degrees C. The proportion of time spent in each instar, however, was not affected by temperature or prey species, but the duration of the pupal stage was significantly affected by temperature. The average daily consumption of prey aphids increased with instar and was significantly influenced by temperature. There was a significant difference in the length of the pupal stage between coccinellid species but not that of the larval stage. The duration of the larval period increased under conditions of prey shortage. The pupal period of Ap. obliterata was significantly affected by the food regime but not that of Ad. bipunctata. There was a significant interaction between species and food supply on the length of the pupal stage and the larval stage and the final fresh weight achieved by the newly emerged adults. Male adults weighed significantly less than the females in all regimes. Larvae of Ap. obliterata and Ad. bipunctata did not consume any of the alternative prey (Collembola or Psocoptera) provided. There was no significant difference in the consumption of prey between the two coccinellid species. The results suggest that both of these coccinellids are well adapted to low-density-specific prey. There were no obvious differences between the two, which would tend to favour either species in an environment of limited prey.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0003-4746	1744-7348		WOS:000258068900007

Although latitudinal variation in lifespan has been studied for a number of species, altitude variation has received much less attention, particularly in insects. We measured the lifespan of different populations of the Natal fruit fly, Ceratitis rosa, along an altitudinal cline. For the different populations, we first measured the residual longevity of wild flies by captive cohort approach and compared the F-1 generation from the same populations. We showed an increase in lifespan with higher altitude for a part of the data obtained. For the field-collected flies (F-0) the average remaining lifespan increased monotonically with altitude for males but not for females. For the F-1 generation, the longevity of both males and females of the highest-altitude population was longer than for the two other lower-altitude populations. This relationship between altitude and lifespan may be explained by the effects of temperature on reproduction. Reproductive schedules in insects are linked to temperature: lower temperature, which is characteristic of high-altitude sites, generally slows down reproduction. Because of a strong trade-off between reproduction and longevity, we therefore observed a longer lifespan for the high-altitude populations. Other hypotheses, such as different predation rates in the different sites, are also discussed.

A prerequisite for any conservation management plan to protect or restore snake populations requires a data base that provides insight into population composition and changes. However, snakes are well known to be particularly difficult to quantitatively sample due to their secretive and elusive nature, and hence accumulating an adequate database for analysis requires long-term field studies that involve intensive searches. Populations of four snake species, Zamensis longissimus, Natrix helvetica, Vipera aspis and Hierophis viridiflavus living in two suburban areas of Rome with different extents of habitat alteration (deforestation), Vejo, a less altered site, and Tor Bella Monaca, a high altered site, have been monitored, but with interruptions since 1995. The results indicated that H. viridiflavus was the commonest species at both sites. Male bias was found in all four species but especially in Z. longissimus and V. aspis with detection of juveniles greatest in H. viridiflavus and N. helvetica. Snout to vent lengths (SVL) of H. viridiflavus and Z. longissimus, which were present at both sites, were greater at the less degraded habitat of the two study localities. Community metrics indicated that the degraded habitat had lower species richness, evenness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, but a higher dominance index. Recapture frequencies of snakes recaptured either once or multiple times were in general greater at Vejo. The highest population densities were found in H. viridiflavus, followed by V. aspis and N. helvetica, which were similar. However, long term trends in densities show declines in V. aspis and N. helvetica between 1995 and 2019. Population densities were in good agreement with density estimates found in previous studies of snakes in more natural habitats.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-0130			WOS:000522794000002		
J	Rand, PS								Modeling feeding and growth in Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon: implications for high-seas distribution and migration								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				234				265	280		10.3354/meps234265				2002	2002	I analyzed data on stomach contents of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and oceanographic variables collected during 1956 to 1964 in order to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of salmon feeding and growth in the Gulf of Alaska. A 2-stage statistical model was used to develop a feeding index, calculated as the product of feeding probability (assessed using the presence/absence of gut contents of individuals collected at each site) and stomach fullness (prey weights transformed to account for temperature-dependent gastric evacuation and allometry). Combining these results with simple bioenergetic principles, I conclude that the reduction in salmon biomass during spring observed along the southern periphery of the Gulf can be explained by an equally sharp reduction in growth potential. This feature demarcates a region (between latitude 58 and 55degreesN) that is favorable to sockeye growth, as demonstrated by an order of magnitude change in salmon growth potential over a narrow range of sea surface temperatures (ca. 6 to 7degreesC). This pattern results from the combined effects of trends in feeding probability and stomach fullness across this temperature gradient. I documented a significant trend of larger fish in cooler water during spring, which might have been related to body size dependent competitive interactions. The trend was reversed in summer, with larger fish in warmer water, perhaps due to the availability of preferred prey (e.g. squid) and directional swimming behavior characteristic of sockeye spawning migration. Assuming salmon are growth-optimizers in this environment, my results suggest that winter residency for sub-adults is restricted to north of latitude 54degrees N. Furthermore, peaks in feeding and growth shifted from a central position in the gulf during spring toward the southeast during summer, with an attendant increase in forage quality. I hypothesize that these patterns are likely to be important in drawing maturing British Columbia salmon toward their natal rivers and providing the energy needed to fuel their costly river migration during mid-summer.									12	0	0	0	12	0	13			0171-8630			WOS:000176571500024

(1) The total estimated food consumption by zooplanktivores is high compared to the production of zooplankton. My calculations of consumption by young-of-the-year (YOY) herring indicate that they alone consume 30-60% of the zooplankton produced. (2) YOY clupeids selected certain zooplankton taxa over others. Selective predation on reproducing individuals will further stress the effects that fish may have in preventing zooplankton from achieving maximum possible population growth rate. (3) The calanoid copepods had stronger vertical migrations than less selected taxa. High feeding pressure forces copepods to lower temperatures, permitting longer reproductive cycles.

Blooms of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Nostocales) are increasingly more common in freshwaters. It can produce neurotoxins (paralytic shellfish poison, PSP), particularly in warm regions of the Americas. The knowledge about the effects of these neurotoxins on the clearance rate of zooplankton from warm regions still lags behind that of other world regions. We compared the toxin profile (using HPLC), morphology and growth rates of two PSP-producing C. raciborskii strains from South America. We evaluated the effect of these two strains on the clearance rate of two medium-sized grazers typical from subtropical and tropical environments, the copepod Notodiaptomus iheringi (similar to 1.1 mm) and the cladoceran Daphnia pulex (similar to 0.8 mm) in 2.5 h experiments. We found differences in the PSP profile, toxicity and morphology of the two C. raciborskii strains. Medium-sized predators were able to remove filaments of both strains in a similar amount despite their morphological and toxin differences. However, cladocera were significantly more affected than copepods in their clearance rates, suggesting differential consequences for their survival and success in warm freshwaters.									6	1	0	0	3	1	8			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000388173000005		
J	WAHL, DH; STEIN, RA								FOOD-CONSUMPTION AND GROWTH OF 3 ESOCIDS - FIELD-TESTS OF A BIOENERGETIC MODEL								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				120	2			230	246		10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0230:FCAGOT>2.3.CO;2				MAR 1991	1991	We quantified diet and compared field estimates of growth and daily ration with predictions from a bioenergetic model for young-of-year muskellunge Esox masquinongy, northern pike E. lucius, and tiger muskellunge E. masquinongy x E. lucius introduced into five Ohio reservoirs. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum dominated esocid diets (77-97% by weight) through autumn but were absent by spring. Diets in late autumn and spring included sunfishes Lepomis spp. and brook silversides Labidesthes sicculus. Northern pike and tiger muskellunge grew faster than muskellunge through the first year. Food consumption was highest for tiger muskellunge, followed by northern pike, then muskellunge. Growth rates and rations were highest immediately after stocking, declining through autumn to their lowest levels in December and spring. A bioenergetic model underestimated final mass by a factor of two to three for all esocids; predictions for food consumption were better than those for growth but still overestimated observed values by 39-52%. Neither behavioral thermoregulation nor incorporation of seasonal energetic content of prey altered predictions (maximum of 2% increase). In contrast, adjustments in metabolic rates to account for differences in season and temperature substantially improved model predictions. Size-selective mortality did not account for the inaccuracies in model predictions. Conversion efficiencies (39-63%) exceeded those previously measured for esocids fed maximum rations, suggesting that model variables should be determined for a range of ration levels. Though used extensively, the predictions of bioenergetic models should not be accepted until the models have been subjected to additional field verification.									66	0	0	0	64	0	68			0002-8487			WOS:A1991FR51600010

The starvation respiration rate (R-M, mu l O-2 d(-1)) as a function of dry body weight (W, mg) could be expressed by means of the equation R-M = aW(b), and was determined to be 18.9 W-0.76 for A. aurita (ephyrae and medusae), 19.4 W-0.91 for S. tubulosa, and 2.39 W-1.02 for A. vitrina. Further, the effect of temperature, feeding and growth on respiration was studied in A. aurita. The weight-specific respiration rate (R-W, mu l O-2 [mg dry wt](-1) d-(1)) increased exponentially with temperature (T, degrees C) within the 7 to 22 degrees C interval at R-W = 0.93e(0.11T) (Q(10) = 3.1). A. aurita ephyrae responded rapidly to the presence of food, and maximum respiration rate was attained after 4 h; after the supply of food was stopped, the respiration rate decreased to the starvation level within 2.5 h. Respiration was measured in A. aurita that were fed different concentrations of an assortment of prey organisms (copepods, rotifers, cirriped larvae, Artemia sp.) to obtain a spectrum of specific growth rates. The weight-specific respiration rate as a function of the weight-specific growth rate was linear, and from the slopes of the regression lines the energetic cost of growth was found to be equivalent to 209% of the growth of A. aurita ephyrae feeding on a variety of prey organisms, and 69 and 42% of the growth of A. aurita medusae preying on Artemia sp. and Acartia tonsa respectively.									26	0	0	0	24	0	27			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000244425100013		
J	Bhandiwad, Ashwin; Johnsen, Sonke								The effects of salinity and temperature on the transparency of the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	5			709	716		10.1242/jeb.049296				MAR 2011	2011	Transparency is an effective form of camouflage, but it must be present throughout the entire volume of an animal to succeed. Certain environmental stressors may cause physiological responses that increase internal light scattering, making tissue less transparent and more conspicuous to predators. We tested this in the transparent grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, which is found in shallow estuaries where both salinity and temperature change rapidly because of tidal cycles, evaporation and runoff. Animals originally kept at a salinity of 15. p.p.t. and a temperature of 20 C were placed into solutions with salinities of 0, 15, 25 or 30 p.p.t. and temperatures of 13, 20 or 27 degrees C for 12 h (N=26 for each of 12 treatments). Under the control conditions of 15. p.p.t. at 20 degrees C, the transparency of grass shrimp tails was 54 +/- 3% (mean +/- s.e.). At higher salinities and at both higher and lower temperatures, transparency dropped significantly (P<0.001, two-way ANOVA), reaching 0.04 +/- 0.01% at 30. p.p.t. at 27 degrees C. Confocal microscopy of P. pugio's tail suggested that the observed loss of transparency was due to the pooling of low refractive index hemolymph between the high index muscle fibers, creating many index boundaries that increased light scattering. Analysis of a year-long salinity and temperature record from a North Carolina estuary showed that changes of the order of those found in this study are relatively common, suggesting that P. pugio may undergo periods of reduced crypsis, potentially leading to increased predation.									14	0	0	0	10	0	14			0022-0949			WOS:000287130200010	21307056

We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities. Maternal mass and foraging effort were not related to pup growth rates between 22 and 85 d, possibly indicating that food was not limiting, food sources other than krill were being used, or differences occurred before pups. reached age 22 d.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000302516900023	22611863

Such behaviour would be especially advantageous to small terrestrial animals, which have low thermal inertia and often have access to a wide range of environmental temperatures over small distances. Using the locust, Locusta migratoria, we have demonstrated a direct link between nutritional state and thermoregulatory behaviour. When faced with chronic restrictions to the supply of nutrients, locusts selected increasingly lower temperatures within a gradient, thereby maximizing nutrient use efficiency at the cost of slower growth. Over the shorter term, when locusts were unable to find a meal in the normal course of ad libitum feeding, they immediately adjusted their thermoregulatory behaviour, selecting a lower temperature at which assimilation efficiency was maximal. Thus, locusts use fine scale patterns of movement and temperature selection to adjust for reduced nutrient supply and thereby ameliorate associated life-history consequences.									46	2	0	0	45	0	46			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000293733600007	21288941

To examine the relative impact of these birds, we continued to study bird populations and the fish consumption rates of these birds at 30 facilities during the summer of 1995 and at 7 facilities during the spring of 1996. Approximately 80% of the fish culturists interviewed perceived bird predation to be a problem at their facility; this view was even more widely held by trout producers. Consistent with these results, 81% of the facilities surveyed during the first phase of study had at least some fish-eating birds present. When asked to list bird predators in order of importance, 76% of 49 managers responding named the great blue heron Ardea herodias as the most important predator of concern. Consistent with these findings was the presence of great blue herons at 90% of the 30 facilities repeatedly surveyed during the summer of 1995. Based on damage projections, common grackles Quiscalus quiscula, mallards Anas platyrhynchos, and great blue herons appeared to be the primary species of concern out of 10 bird species observed. However, mallard problems were relatively isolated, and previous damage estimates reported in the literature for mallards, common grackles, and American crows Corvus brachyrhynchos may have been highly inflated. Of the 24 trout-rearing facilities surveyed during the summer of 1995, 21% were estimated to have sustained bird predation losses in excess of US$10,000. Smaller losses, ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars, were more typical of the remaining trout and warmwater fish facilities.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			1522-2055			WOS:000089190000012

However, Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and other gadids continue to thrive in the Bering Sea despite delayed prey production resulting from warming and loss of sea ice. In this study, we examined how temperature mediates growth and survival of Pacific cod larvae under varying match-mismatch conditions. Cod larvae were reared at two temperatures (3 degrees C and 8 degrees C) and exposed to one of five different food treatments over a 6-week period: (i) high food (HF) (match); (ii) low food (LF); (iii) HF then LF (HF-LF); and (iv) LF then HF (LF-HF) (24 mismatch); and (v) no food (NF) (complete mismatch). Results showed that cold environments allow Pacific cod larvae to bridge gaps in prey availability (i.e., timing and magnitude), but negatively impact survival over longer periods. Under warmer conditions, mismatches in prey significantly impacted growth and survival. However, both yolk reserves and compensatory growth mechanisms reduced the severity of mismatches occurring in the first 3 weeks of development. Our results demonstrate a clear need to incorporate the direct effects of temperature on fish larvae in food limitation models.									25	0	0	0	20	0	25			0706-652X			WOS:000287146300005

Acartia omorii								MARINE BIOLOGY				125	1			109	117		10.1007/BF00350765				MAR 1996	1996	Population dynamics and production of the calanoid copepod Acartia omorii Bradford were studied from November 1986 to November 1987 in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was present in the plankton from October to July (temperature range: 8.9 to 24.3 degrees C), with peaks in February-March and June. During this period, nine generations could be detected, for which the mean population egg production rate and midstage abundance of each life stage older than naupliar Stage (N) II were determined to trace survival. The population suffered extremely high mortality during the early life stages: on average only 2.5% of the eggs produced recruited into NII. This large loss is probably concentrated within the egg stage, due to predation, including cannibalism, by omnivorous copepods, in addition to sinking loss of eggs in the water column. However, the mortality from NII to copepodite Stage (C) V was negligible, indicating low predation pressure by large carnivores. The biomass of A. omorii showed marked seasonal variations in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous growth rate of each stage increased exponentially with increasing temperature. The integrated production rate of A. omorii from 7 November 1986 to 21 July 1987 was 749 mg C m(-3) or 5.62 gCm(-2).									53	3	1	0	44	0	60			0025-3162			WOS:A1996UD84100011

In the present study methods were developed to quantify the effects of crab predation on mussel beds, with the aim of estimating losses of mussels to crabs in the mussel fishery located in the Menai Strait, United Kingdom. There were significant linear relationships between crab carapace width and the number and size of mussels consumed. Increases in the mean length of mussels presented to crabs resulted in an exponential decline in the number of mussels consumed. Consequently, there was a similar decline in the predicted losses of mussels during the cultivation process as mussels increased in body size. It was estimated that C. maenas consumed 10% of seed mussels laid in the Menai Strait during their growth to a marketable size. Although crab abundance and size, and seawater temperature substantially influenced the number of mussels eaten, the size of mussels was by far the dominant factor in determining losses. Therefore, efforts to control crab predation should focus on the early stages of the cultivation process and on areas where the smaller, more vulnerable, mussels are present. The coefficients and formulae presented here could be applied to other areas of Mytilus edulis cultivation subject to predation by C. maenas.									22	0	0	0	23	0	23			0730-8000			WOS:000252327300023

Which one best predicts the establishment of an endemic Atlantic Forest palm?								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				9	12			7284	7290		10.1002/ece3.5300				JUN 2019	2019	Historically, macroecology and microecology have diverged with regard to the niche concept. A better understanding of functioning ecological systems, however, depends on an integrative approach to this concept at different spatial scales. A mixed approach, merging macro- and microscale by validating ecological niche modeling (ENM) with the results of in situ experiments and environmental data collection was used to understand if areas identified by ENM as highly suitable for adult palms are also adequate for seedling establishment. Syagrus weddelliana's (Arecaceae) distribution range falls within the Atlantic Rain Forest, and more specifically Serra dos & Oacute; rgaos region (Rio de Janeiro state), southeastern Brazil. The following steps were performed: (a) ENM to delimit the area of occurrence of S. weddelliana and locate experimental areas; (b) a seed sowing experiment in areas with presence or absence of the species in areas of high or low environmental suitability at 36 experimental stations; and (c) characterization of each microhabitat which was related back to the macroscale results of ENM. Evidence of biotic and abiotic limitations was found for S. weddelliana distribution. Areas of higher suitability had lower seed predation rates and, consequently, higher seed germination rates. On the other hand, areas with low environmental suitability at the macroscale were divided into two types: areas with microhabitat similar to that of areas with high environmental suitability that had some germination despite high predation and areas with different environmental conditions that had no germination and high predation rates. Seedlings and adults had different abiotic requirements. Microhabitat conditions were more important for the initial establishment of S. weddelliana than macroclimatic variables. This finding demonstrates that macro- and microecological information works in a complementary way to a better understanding of the distribution of S. weddelliana.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000478648300042	31380050

Five marlin between 100 and 420 kg were successfully tracked for periods of 8 to 27 h. Of the three others tagged, one was killed by a shark and two shed their tags, probably as the result of poor attachment. The black marlin spent most of their time within 10 m of the surface, both day and night. During the day, however, they also spent some time between 40 and 140 m depth. They rarely penetrated the thermocline, and then only briefly, remaining at temperatures no more than 8 C degrees below that of surface waters. The deepest dives were to 178 m. Four of the five marlin tracked, initially moved offshore before heading parallel to the shore, whereas the other marlin stayed close to the reef edge. The average mean swimming speeds over the ground for entire tracks ranged from 0.7 to 1.02 m s(-1).									49	0	0	0	44	2	50			0025-3162			WOS:000083839200019

Reassessment of copepod grazing impact based on continuous time series of in vivo gut fluorescence from individual copepods								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				34	1			55	71		10.1093/plankt/fbr086				JAN 2012	2012	Copepod grazing is a fundamental link between autotrophs and heterotrophs, affecting the particle size spectrum, modifying trophic interactions for a wide range of organisms, and playing a potentially significant role in the carbon cycle. A considerable amount of work has been done to quantify and understand feeding in copepods from a behavioral, physiological and ecological standpoint. An impressive body of knowledge has accumulated as a result. However, some of the methods used to experimentally determine copepod grazing have known, un-quantified problems. The small size of individual copepods requires the use of multiple animals, thereby introducing poorly understood variability. Digestion and gut dynamics in copepods are not fully understood either. Here we propose an approach to measure grazing that aims to be complementary to past contributions. Using a novel planar laser imaging technique, we have quantified grazing (pellet evacuation rates and gut clearance rates, K) in feeding copepods (Calanus pacificus). Highly resolved time series up to 5 h long were obtained from individual copepods at three different temperatures. K was found to be temperature-dependent, to vary in time and among copepods, and to be significantly higher during feeding than non-feeding, invalidating some assumptions of previous methods. Previous studies not accounting for the observed variations in K may have underestimated copepod ingestion by 15-70%. This suggests that copepods may exert a greater grazing pressure on phytoplankton than previously estimated, implying a higher copepod-mediated vertical carbon transport, and a greater transfer rate of energy to higher trophic levels.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000298187200004

Since the 1980s, it has suffered drastic population losses with no signs of recovery and has been classified as a critically endangered species. Its rapid growth rate makes it an excellent candidate for coral restoration programs. In 2011, the Fundacion Dominicana de Estudios Marinos (Dominican Marine Studies Foundation, FUNDEMAR) began an A. cervicornis restoration program in Bayahibe, southeast Dominican Republic. In this study, we present the methodology and results of this program from its conception through 2017, a preliminary analysis of the strong 2016 and 2017 cyclonic seasons in the greater Caribbean, and a genetic characterization of the "main nursery". The mean survival of the fragments over 12 months was 87.45 +/- 4.85% and the mean productivity was 4.01 +/- 1.88 cm year(-1) for the eight nurseries. The mean survival of six outplanted sites over 12 months was 71.55 +/- 10.4%, and the mean productivity was 3.03 +/- 1.30 cm year(-1). The most common cause of mortality during the first 12 months, in both nurseries and outplanted sites, was predation by the fireworm, Hermodice carunculata. We identified 32 multilocus genotypes from 145 total analyzed individuals. The results and techniques described here will aid in the development of current and future nursery and outplanted site restoration programs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000526522100004	32337099

J	Spiller, Kimberly J.; Dettmers, Randy					Spiller, Kimberly/0000-0001-8775-1568			Evidence for multiple drivers of aerial insectivore declines in North America								CONDOR				121	2					duz010	10.1093/condor/duz010				MAY 2019	2019	Aerial insectivores (birds that forage on aerial insects) have experienced significant population declines in North America. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for these declines, but current evidence suggests multiple factors could be operating in combination during their annual migratory cycles between breeding and nonbreeding areas. Potential drivers include decreased prey abundance, direct or indirect impacts of environmental contaminants, habitat loss, phenological changes due to warming climate, and conditions on migratory stopover or wintering grounds. While no single threat appears to be the cause of aerial insectivore declines, existing evidence suggests that several of these factors could be contributing to the declines at different times in the annual lifecycle. Breeding productivity for most of these species does not appear to be limited by overall prey abundance, contaminants, or habitat loss, which suggests that similar issues on nonbreeding grounds or carryover effects could play important roles. However, a better understanding of the importance of prey quality throughout the lifecycle is critically needed. Based on current evidence, we propose that changes in availability of high-quality prey, with variability across breeding and nonbreeding grounds, reduce various combinations of fledging success, post-fledging survival, and nonbreeding season body condition of aerial insectivores, resulting in species and geographic differences in population trends. We encourage others to use this hypothesis as a starting point to test specific mechanisms by which availability of high-quality prey influences demographic parameters. We suggest that future research focus on defining prey quality, monitoring insect abundance in conjunction with birds, comparing demographic models across local populations experiencing different population growth rates, and using tracking technology to document important migratory and nonbreeding areas. Considerable research progress already has been made, but additional research is needed to better understand the complex web of potential causes driving aerial insectivore declines.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0010-5422	1938-5129		WOS:000477805900011		
J	Young, Joelle D.; Yan, Norman D.				Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865			Modification of the diel vertical migration of Bythotrephes longimanus by the cold-water planktivore, Coregonus artedi								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				53	5			981	995		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01954.x				MAY 2008	2008	1. The weak diel vertical migration observed in the large cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus seems contradictory to the predator-avoidance hypothesis that predicts large zooplankton should have long migration amplitudes. However, cold-water planktivores, especially Coregonus spp., are a main source of mortality for Bythotrephes and hence a deeper migration would result in a greater overlap with these hypolimnetic planktivores. We hypothesized that Coregonus artedi (cisco) modifies the normal vertical migration pattern of Bythotrephes, such that the latter stays higher in the water column during the day and thus migrates less extremely at night.2. The vertical distribution of Bythotrephes during the day was determined from single visits to six lakes in Ontario, Canada, all of which contain warm-water, epilimnetic planktivores but differing in whether they contain cisco. One lake of each fish type was sampled day and night every 2-3 weeks over the ice-free season to examine daytime depths and migration amplitude.3. The vertical migration of Bythotrephes differed in the presence and absence of cisco. In the lakes with cisco, there were significantly fewer Bythotrephes in the hypolimnion and they were higher in the water column during the day. Migration amplitude was smaller in the cisco than in the non-cisco lake. These observations were not attributable to differences in physical factors, and, although not conclusively attributable to cisco, are consistent with an effect of cisco.4. We suggest that diurnal depth selection by Bythotrephes in lakes containing cisco is a trade-off between the risk of predation by warm- versus cold-water predators, balanced by the benefits of increased temperature and feeding rates near the surface. Even in lakes without cisco, however, the vertical migration of Bythotrephes was less than expected, suggesting that diurnal depth selection is a balance between the risk from warm-water planktivores and access to sufficient light to feed effectively.									35	0	0	0	33	0	35			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000254808400013

The distribution and diet of fish, as well as the specific composition of their prey, have been affected by the magnification of the spatial variations in salinity due to hydraulic infrastructure and climate change. Cathorops aguadulce was selected based on previous records of its diet and its current dominance in the estuarine systems in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Goals. The feeding habits were evaluated in relation to the variation of size composition, day-night, and seasonality in a coastal lagoon in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Methods. Two hundred ten digestive tracts were analyzed in juveniles and adults captured in a sampling that included the day-night and seasonal variation in three sampling sites located in a salinity gradient. The size composition was correlated (Spearman coefficient) with the spatial and temporal variation of salinity and temperature. The temporal and spatial variations of the Repletion (IR) and Relative Importance (IIR) indexes were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and hierarchical clustering. Results. The size composition was independent of salinity variation and IR values (Kruskal-Wallis; p = 0.649). Yet diet intensity in the dry season was significantly greater than in the transition and rainy seasons (Kruskal-Wallis; p = 0.00001). Among the 11 food items defined, animal detritus and malacostracans, mainly tanaids, were the dominant feeding categories in the frequency of occurrence and according to the IIR. However, detritus predominated in juveniles, while tanaids were the preponderant item in the adults. Conclusions. Even though laguna Mecoacan recorded an ample salinity variation, C. aguadulce recorded a significant temporal variation in intensity of diet; the ontogenic shift of its diet was more relevant than the effects of the environmental variation of its feeding habits. This conclusion opens the possibility of testing whether the ontogenetic variation of their functional morphological traits is associated with the acquisition of food or movement.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0188-8897			WOS:000418486800003		
J	Whitman, KL; McDermott, JJ; Oehrlein, MS								Laboratory studies on suspension feeding in the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus (Decapoda : Anomura : Paguridae)								JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY				21	3			582	592		10.1651/0278-0372(2001)021[0582:LSOSFI]2.0.CO;2				AUG 2001	2001	Pagurus longicarpus readily removes small prey (Artemia nauplii) from suspension under laboratory conditions. In our experiments, clearance rates of recently hatched nauplii were equal for male and female crabs and for crabs within or removed from their gastropod shells. Most feeding trials were performed with shelf-less crabs, Crabs fed more effectively on nauplii in water of ambient salinity (30 parts per thousand) than at 15 parts per thousand. Feeding was more efficient between 20 degrees and 30 degreesC than at lower temperatures and was equally efficient in the light or dark. Rates of nauplii consumption were positively correlated with crab length. At concentrations of 4 nauplii/ml, crabs removed approximately 40% and 60% from suspension in 5 and 10 minutes, respectively. Nauplii were cleared more rapidly at higher concentrations. First zoeae of the brachyurans Dyspanopeus sayi and Carcinus maenas were readily removed from suspension by Pagurus longicarpus, but at lower rates than the smaller Artemia nauplii. The relatively large first zoeae of Palaemonetes vulgaris also were removed from suspension; in this case the crabs used their chelipeds to capture the zoeae. Up to 35% of recently hatched veligers of the gastropod Crepidula planet, the smallest prey species. were removed in 5-minute trials. The stomachs of crabs collected in the field contained what appeared to be a benthic diet of detritus but with some evidence of crustacean fragments that could have been derived from suspension. The mouth parts of P. longicarpus are not specialized for suspension feeding as in some species of hermit crabs. The activities of these mouth parts in conjunction with movements of the chelipeds and anterior walking legs combine to produce eddy currents around the head bringing suspended prey to the vicinity of the outer mouth parts where prey are grasped and ingested. Although the potential for active and efficient suspension feeding has been demonstrated. further observations are required to evaluate its importance in the crabs' natural habitat.									12	0	0	0	14	0	14			0278-0372			WOS:000172729800004		
J	Moore, AE; Larkin, PA								Drainage evolution in south-central Africa since the breakup of Gondwana								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY				104	1			47	68		10.2113/104.1.47				MAR 2001	2001	The drainage system in south-central Africa has undergone major reorganisations since the disruption of Gondwana, Isopachs of the Kalahari sequence and a variety of geomorphological features can be used to pinpoint abandoned drainage lines. Continental fluvial sediments of Mesozoic-Cenozoic age reflect river systems, which existed prior to and immediately following continental break-up. The east coast sedimentary sequence documents changes in the location of major supplies of terrigenous sediments, and provides a framework for establishing the timing of changes in drainage configuration. This evidence indicates that during the upper Jurassic to Cretaceous, the Okavango, Cuando and Zambezi-Luangwa rivers formed the headwaters of the proto-Limpopo. The lower-Zambezi-Shire formed a separate graben-bound river system with a discharge point into the Indian Ocean in the vicinity of mouth of the present-day Zambezi. A third major drainage entered the Indian in the vicinity of the modern Save Mouth. End Cretaceous uplift along the Okavango-Kalahari-Zimbabwe Axis severed the links between the Limpopo and the Okavango, Cuando and Zambezi-Luangwa. This resulted in a senile endoreic drainage system which supplied sediment to the Kalahari basin. However, the uplift rejuvenated the lower Zambezi, initiating headward erosion and progressive capture of the Luangwa, upper Zambezi and Kafue. Predatory headward extension of the Zambezi is still active, and this river will eventually capture the Okavango. The model developed for drainage reorganisation provides a framework for interpreting kimberlitic heavy mineral dispersion patterns, it also forms the basis for explaining fish and plant dispersion patterns, and understanding recent water level fluctuations in the Makgadigadi pans system in Botswana.									117	1	0	0	47	0	120			1012-0750	1996-8590		WOS:000177252500005

During the breeding season, when offspring place additional demands on the quantity of food adults need to collect, diurnal foraging patterns may be influenced to a greater extent by food availability because adults need to balance starvation-predation risks not only for themselves but also their offspring. We used data-loggers to measure diurnal variation in rates of nest visits to 7- to 10-day-old nestlings of the insectivorous Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe in Swedish farmland habitat. Adults provisioned the nestlings with food for an average 19.5 h each day (n = 11 pairs), with visitation rates sharply increasing during the morning, remaining relatively stable between 0800 and 1700 hours, and then declining in the evening. This pattern is similar to daily temperature fluctuations and is consistent with the hypothesis that nest visit rates are a function of temperature-dependent prey availability. Higher rates of nest visits on warm days support this correlation between temperature and offspring feeding. However, without data on the rate of self-feeding by adults it is difficult to distinguish between patterns of nest visits being driven by food availability, or starvation-predation constraints being imposed on the parents; thus, future studies of patterns of offspring feeding should collect data on the self-feeding behaviour of the adults.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			0021-8375			WOS:000259440000005

While data on single stressor effects on fish are accumulating rapidly, we still know relatively little about interactive effects of multiple drivers. Of particular concern in this context are the early life stages of fish, for which direct effects of increased CO2 on growth and development have been observed. Whether these effects are further modified by elevated temperature was investigated here for the larvae of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), a commercially important fish species. Over a period of 32 days, larval survival, growth in size and weight, and instantaneous growth rate were assessed in a crossed experimental design of two temperatures (10 degrees C and 12 degrees C) with two CO2 levels (400 mu atm and 900 mu atm CO2) at food levels mimicking natural levels using natural prey. Elevated temperature alone led to increased swimming activity, as well as decreased survival and instantaneous growth rate (Gi). The comparatively high sensitivity to elevated temperature in this study may have been influenced by low food levels offered to the larvae. Larval size, Gi and swimming activity were not affected by CO2, indicating tolerance of this species to projected "end of the century" CO2 levels. A synergistic effect of elevated temperature and CO2 was found for larval weight, where no effect of elevated CO2 concentrations was detected in the 12 degrees C treatment, but a negative CO2 effect was found in the 10 degrees C treatment. Contrasting CO2 effects were found for survival between the two temperatures. Under ambient CO2 conditions survival was increased at 12 degrees C compared to 10 degrees C. In general, CO2 effects were minor and considered negligible compared to the effect of temperature under these mimicked natural food conditions. These findings emphasize the need to include biotic factors such as energy supply via prey availability in future studies on interactive effects of multiple stressors.									13	0	0	0	13	0	13			1932-6203			WOS:000423416600118	29370273	
J	Skold, M; Barker, MF; Mladenov, PV								Spatial variability in sexual and asexual reproduction of the fissiparous seastar Coscinasterias muricata: the role of food and fluctuating temperature								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				233				143	155		10.3354/meps233143				2002	2002	Populations of the fissiparous seastar Coscinasterias muricata were surveyed around New Zealand to determine the frequency of asexual reproduction, Seastars from an intertidal population from the Maori Bay (North Island) and 2 shallow subtidal-intertidal sites in Otago Harbour on the east coast of the South Island had split, were asymmetrical, had multiple madreporites and skewed sex ratios when gonads were present. In contrast, none of the populations from 13 subtidal populations from the fjords on the west coast or a subtidal population from Stewart Island had characters indicating that they had recently split. Examination of genetic diversity using allozymes agreed with morphological interpretations; the populations from the Maori Bay and the east coast (Otago Harbour) had significantly lower genotypic diversity than expected, while the fjord populations had genotypic diversity that conformed to expectations under sexual outcrossing. We investigated the effects of food supply and fluctuating temperature on growth, energy storage, gonad development and fission of C, muricata from a fissiparous population in Otago Harbour. Growth, gonad development and the pyloric caeca index increased with increased food supply. No effects were found due to the fluctuating temperature regime. Fission occurred in all treatments except when the seastars were starving, as indicated by decrease in size. Gonad development and energy storage under intermediate food supply were similar to measurements of individuals in the field, and suggest food limitation for the population studied. Since fissiparity decreases with increasing size in C, muricata and growth rates and gonad development increase with supply of food, we propose that the occurrence of apparently fewer fissiparous individuals in habitats where food is abundant is correlated to food supply. Rapid growth would allow individuals to more quickly reach the size threshold at which fission begins to be suppressed. Conversely, where food supply or feeding time is limiting growth, the pattern would be a relative increase in abundance of small fissiparous individuals. However, populations from the fjords and Stewart Island do not seem to undergo fission at all. A possible explanation could be that the asexual mode of reproduction of this species is not triggered in the sheltered subtidal fjord environment. Another possibility could be that natural selection acts against asexual reproduction by fission in the fjord environment, or that the ability to split was lost due to founder effects and random genetic drift when the fjords were successively colonised following the rise in sea level after the last ice-age.									24	0	0	0	22	2	25			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000176283200012

Few reports have examined the impact on the ability of predators at the third trophic level. In this experiment, we made use of open-top chambers to quantify the effects of elevated CO2 on growth, development, and predatory ability of two successive generations of Chinese lacewing, Chrysopa sinica (Tjeder) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), feeding on cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), which were reared on cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae), grown under elevated CO2 (double ambient vs. ambient). Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations reduced the duration of larval development and the survival rate of pupae, and caused decreased weight in adult female C. sinica, but had no significant effects on survival rate of each larval stage, female adult fecundity, egg hatch rate, or adult life span. The predatory ability of larvae in the third instar and the total larval stage of C. sinica that fed on A. gossypii were significantly lower in elevated CO2 environments. The number of aphids consumed by first-generation lacewing population did not change significantly with different CO2 treatments; however, significantly fewer aphids were consumed by the second generation of the lacewing population with elevated CO2. We speculate that A. gossypii may become a more serious pest under an environment with elevated CO2 concentrations because of the reduced predatory ability of C. sinica on A. gossypii.									8	4	0	0	11	0	12			0013-8703			WOS:000276404800002

Predation during the incubation phase is a major cause of nesting failure in open-nesting altricial birds such as the Eurasian reed warbler. The nest predation rate in this species has recently been shown to be substantially reduced under conditions of experimentally elevated invertebrate prey availability. Food availability near the nest may be an important determinant of adult incubation and nest defence behaviours during the incubation period. We used two experimental studies to compare incubation behaviour and nest defence in food-supplemented and unsupplemented adult Eurasian reed warblers during the incubation phase. In the first study we measured nest defence behavioural responses to a taxidermic mount of a native predator (stoat Mustela erminea). In the second study we used temperature loggers installed in nests to measure breaks in incubation as a measure of nest vulnerability. Food-supplemented birds responded aggressively to the presence of a predator more quickly than those in the unsupplemented group, suggesting they are closer to their nest and can more quickly detect a predator in the vicinity. Food-supplemented birds also had shorter breaks in incubation (both in terms of maximum and mean off-bout durations), presumably because they were foraging for shorter periods or over shorter distances from the nest. This study therefore identifies the behavioural mechanisms by which changes in food availability may lead to changes in nest survival and thus breeding productivity, in open-nesting insectivorous birds.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0908-8857	1600-048X		WOS:000443943500007

The different levels of emphasis are the coral animal and the reef community. The main study area is the Red Sea which reaches over 20 degrees latitude up to the northernmost margin of the global coral reef belt. Supplementary results on microborer ecology are provided from the Bahamas.The desert enclosed Red Sea, not influenced by land runoff and only minimally by anthropogenic (urban and touristic) nutrient inputs, is predestined for a study on the principal influence of light on calcification within bathymetrical and latitudinal gradients. Hence, on the level of the zooxanthellate scleractinian animal phototrophic and heterotrophic energy supply and its bearing on calcification are being measured in different coral species - in particular in Porites sp., one of the most important reef builders.The growth of 15 zooxanthellate scleractinians in the Gulf of Aqaba correlates with the annual light cycle. This correlation is observable down to 40 m depth. Other growth promoting factors seem to have less influence on coral extension. The availability of organically enriched sediments in shallow water probably yields nutritional value, in particular for filter feeding species, thus restricting their distribution to those areas. Zooxanthellae, when isolated from Mycedium elephantotus, are different in their dependence on depth in maximum rates of photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency ( -slope). Increasing concentrations of pigments as a function of depth could be determined. Maximum rates of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae in vivo, collected at corresponding depth, have been 4 times higher. Structural and physiological adaptations improving heterotrophic and phototrophic energy intake are highlighted.Porites sp. was the subject of annual growth studies at locations extending from Aqaba in the North over the northern and southern Egyptian coast and islands, Sanganeb Atoll and Wingate reef offshore Sudan to the Gulf of Tadjoura in the Gulf of Aden (Djibouti). Mean growth rates in the shallow water zone increase with decreasing latitude and are highest at the southernmost studied reefs in the Gulf of Tadjoura. However, the observed latitudinal growth reduction is restricted to the upper ca. 15 m of the water column. The upper limit of growth potential decreases with depth parallel to the decrease of light availability. Highest growth rates are recorded in shallow depth (10-12.9 mm yr(-1)). This zone reaches at Aqaba (29 degrees 30'N) to a depth of ca. 10 m. At the southern Egyptian reefs (24 degrees 30'N) this zone extends to ca. 15 m water depth. This effect is probably a result of the stronger reduction of winter light levels and water temperature in the northern regions. Compared to other oceans the decrease of growth with increasing latitude of Red Sea Porites corals is far less, and growth rates at Aqaba are the highest observed at these latitudes.On the level of the community of reef inhabitants four principal topics are addressed:The first one is the dynamics of the proportions of hermatypic and ahermatypic organisms and open space. The occurrence of stony and soft corals and the sharing of empty space in different reef sections at Aqaba and on Sanganeb Atoll were quantified. Soft corals, mainly Sinularia- and xeniid species, occupy decreasing shares with depth. Among the Xenia species a bathymetrical zonation pattern was detected.The next issue is the growth impeding role of soft corals and gastropod parasites and predators on scleractinians. Experimental and field observations showed xeniid soft corals to be opportunistic i.e. occupying rapidly open space rather than to attacking and outcompeting stony corals. An increasingly specialized behaviour was detected among corallivorous gastropods of the family Corallophilidae to exploit their coral hosts. Whereas these snails are more or less sessile and depend for a long time on the surrounding host polyps the mobile Drupella cornus (Thaididae) forms feeding aggregations which denude mainly branching corals on shallow reef parts.Furthermore, the role counteracting reef growth of macro- and microbioeroders is investigated. Diadema setosum is a major destructive agent on reefs at Aqaba (not in the central Red Sea). The grazing sea urchins do not only keep potential colonization area free but also erode carbonate material (e. g. 1468 g/m(2)/year, 10 m depth). Demographic and bathymetric patterns in the sea urchin population are analyzed including their bearing on bioerosion of the reef. Investigations on microboring organisms in carbonate material have started in the Red Sea; initial results, however, are only available from similar studies near Lee Stocking island, Bahamas.Three major environments have been identified based on the distribution of the different microborers. These are1) the intertidal environment dominated by boring cyanobacteria,2) reef sites from 2 to 30 m water depth dominated by a diverse assemblage of boring cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, and3) the deep reef slope from 100 to 300 m dominated by boring green algae and heterotrophs.The boring chlorophyte genus Phaeophila appears rapidly and dominates at sites from 2 to 30 m, but it leaves vacated borings and is replaced by Ostreobium quekettii after 1 year. Different substrate types show very different rates of colonization by microborers. The greatest excavation rates (100 g /m(2)/3 months) occur in fine-grained limestone, while the slowest rates (0.5 g/m(2)/3 months) occur in calcite crystals. Molluscan shell material shows intermediate rates of excavation. Light conditions appear very important in determining the growth rate and distribution of different microborers between the sites, however, the interaction of light with other factors, such as substrate, time period of exposure, and water quality conditions may be involved.									34	0	0	0	26	0	35			0172-9179			WOS:A1995QZ61500004

We examine here whether climate of origin (arid/wet), colony personality composition (shy/bold/mixed), and group size determine the repeatability of collective foraging behavior in Stegodyphus dumicola Pocock, 1898 (Eresidae). Experimental colonies were created with contrasting ratios of bold/shy group members and run through 20 simulated prey capture events in a greenhouse. We found that (i) larger colonies and colonies composed of bold spiders were more repeatable in how many attackers they deployed to prey stimuli, (ii) colonies composed of shy spiders were more repeatable in their latency of attack, and (iii) climate of origin had no effect on the repeatability of colony behavior. Colony bold/shy composition had no effect on within-group variation in foraging behavior. Thus, differences in repeatability were the result of increases in between-group differences in foraging behavior, and not shifts in the behavioral flexibility of individual colonies. These results indicate that changes to colony composition and group size can alter the extent to which colonies exhibit characteristic behavioral differences.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0161-8202	1937-2396		WOS:000486650600012

Over a 9-year period, we monitored M. cerifera fruit crops in 13 0.1-ha study plots in South Carolina, U.S.A. Peak ripeness occurred in November, whereas peak removal occurred in the coldest months, December and January. Mean time to fruit removal within study plots was positively correlated with mean winter temperatures, thereby supporting our hypothesis. This result, combined with the generally low availability of winter arthropods, suggests that fruit abundance may play a role in determining winter survivorship and distribution of permanent resident and short-distance migrant birds. From the plant's perspective, it demonstrates inter-annual variation in the temporal component of seed dispersal, with possible consequences for post-dispersal seed and seedling ecology.									32	1	0	0	34	0	34			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000220097200004	14716556

Are the patterns thus generated consistent with existing data?Features of the model: Rosenzweig-type predator-prey model, with lemmings interacting with depletable plants and herbaceous plants. The impact of marine-subsidized predators is included as an extra mortality factor, influencing lemmings in summer.Ranges of parameters: We set the carrying capacity of depletable plants at 2000 kg.ha(-1). We used carrying capacities for herbaceous plants of 1000 kg.ha(-1) (grassland/meadow) and 100 kg.ha(-1) (heath). In the absence of predation, we assume that the population growth rate of lemmings in summer is zero when their foraging rate is 44% of the saturation rate. In subsequent simulations, we successively increased the foraging rate required for a zero population growth rate to simulate the impact of a successively larger pool of marine-subsidized predators.Predictions: On grassland/meadow tundra, increasing intensity of summer predation reduces the amplitude and period of lemming and plant oscillations and increases the minimum and average density of lemmings and depletable plants. The predicted predator-lemming relationship is thus mutualistic rather than exploitative. In heath-type tundra, the predicted positive impact of summer predation on lemmings is even stronger because, without intense summer predation, the predicted oscillations are violent enough to lead to local extinctions. In tundra areas with such dynamics, natural selection should favour lemmings that react to high population densities by emigrating.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			1522-0613	1937-3791		WOS:000322366100001

In addition, the advance of nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry allows, due to its high sensitivity, the study of venoms from species previously left aside, such as ants. Ant venoms are a complex mixture of compounds used for defense, predation or communication purposes. The venom from Neoponera ants, a genus restricted to Neotropical regions, is known to have cytolytic, hemolytic, antimicrobial and insecticidal activities. Moreover, venoms from several Neoponera species have been compared and differences in their toxicity related to nesting habitat variation were reported. Therefore, the present study aimed to perform a deep peptidomic analysis of Neoponera villosa venom and a comparison of seasonal and nesting habitat variations using high-resolution mass spectrometry.Methods: Specimens of N. villosa ants were captured in Panga Natural Reserve (Uberlandia, MG, Brazil) from arboreal and ground-dwelling nests during summer and winter time. The venom glands were dissected, pooled and disrupted by ultra-sonic waves. The venom collected from different habitats (arboreal and ground-dwelling) and different seasons (summer and winter) was injected into a nanoACQUITY ULPC hyphened to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The raw data were analyzed using PEAKS 7.Results: The results showed a molecular diversity of more than 500 peptides among these venoms, mostly in the mass range of 800-4000 Da. Mutations and post-translational modifications were described and differences among the venoms were observed. Part of the peptides matched with ponericins, a well-known antimicrobial peptide family. In addition, smaller fragments related to ponericins were also identified, suggesting that this class of antimicrobial peptide might undergo enzymatic cleavages.Conclusion: There are substantial differences among the venom of N. villosa ants collected in different seasons and from different nest habitats. The venom composition is affected by climate changes that influence prey availability and predator presence. Clearly, nano-LC-MS boosted the knowledge about ant venom, a rich source of unexplored and promising bioactive compounds.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8				1678-9199		WOS:000425440400001	29467797	
J	Kaupas, L. A.; Barclay, R. M. R.								Temperature-dependent consumption of spiders by little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), but not northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), in northern Canada								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				96	3			261	268		10.1139/cjz-2017-0123				MAR 2018	2018	Intraspecific variation in diet has been observed in many species, including the geographically widespread little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)). Spider consumption by M. lucifugus is more common in northern regions of their distribution, possibly due to reduced availability of aerial prey during low temperatures. However, in previously studied northern regions, M. lucifugus was the only bat species captured. The purpose of our study was to examine whether there is overlap in the diet and morphology of M. lucifugus and the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis (Trouessart, 1897)), a species that commonly gleans prey, in the Northwest Territories, Canada. There were significant differences in the dietary composition and wing morphology of the two species, suggesting partitioning of resources. Both species consumed spiders, although unlike M. septentrionalis, the probability of M. lucifugus consuming spiders was significantly greater at low temperatures. Myotis lucifugus demonstrated a different pattern of spider consumption than in other northern regions where it consumes spiders throughout the summer, suggesting the possibility of resource competition where M. lucifugus overlaps with M. septentrionalis. Further research is needed to determine whether arthropods are seasonally limiting at high latitudes and to examine how these species capture nonaerial prey, including spiders.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000427385500011

However, there remains a pressing need to understand the environmental factors controlling the dispersal, successful establishment and subsequent ecological impacts of INNS for receiving ecosystems. Here, we examine how region-wide flow regime magnitudes facilitate the successful establishment of an invasive crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus, signal crayfish) in England (UK). We also consider the interactive effects of invasive crayfish with flow regime variations on the structural and functional diversity of macroinvertebrate communities.Low-flow magnitudes increased the likelihood of P. leniusculus establishment, with 80% of recorded invasion dates falling in years with flow magnitudes below average (low- and low-moderate flow classes), whilst only 1.6% occurred in high-flow years.Temporal trajectories of structural and functional macroinvertebrate responses in invaded rivers demonstrated reduced diversity compared to control rivers. Lower taxonomic and functional richness measures typically coincided with periods of low discharge in invaded rivers and were greatest during regionally high-flows.Macroinvertebrate communities displayed significant structural and functional responses to the interaction between invasive crayfish and flow regime variations. Specifically, a number of low- and high-flow indices yielded significant associations, highlighting the role of extreme hydrological events in shaping INNS effects on receiving ecosystems. We also detected greater ecological effects of invasive crayfish under hydrologically stable conditions. Importantly, and for the first time, we observed that invasive crayfish reversed macroinvertebrate community responses to flow regime cues (e.g. discharge fall rate and minimum flows in the preceding 180 days).Synthesis and applications. Results from this study indicate that low-flow events facilitate the spread/establishment of invasive crayfish and correspond with greater ecological effects for receiving ecosystems. Given that low-flow events are predicted to increase in intensity, duration and frequency over the 21st century, our results highlight the potential threat that invasive crayfish may pose under future hydroclimatic changes. Managing river flow regimes effectively (including maintaining higher flow events and flow variability) is likely to be vital in conserving ecological diversity following crayfish invasion.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000530157500004

Effects of river flow on larval growth and survival of Japanese seaperch Lateolabrax japonicus (Pisces) in the Chikugo River estuary, upper Ariake Bay								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				69	6			1662	1674		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2006.01235.x				DEC 2006	2006	The abundance and growth history of larval and juvenile Japanese seaperch Lateolabrax japonicus were investigated in the Chikugo River estuary, upper Ariake Bay, from 1990 to 2000. Growth during the larval period (up to 15 mm standard length, L-S, the size at recruitment into the estuary) was backcalculated using sagittal otolith microstructures by the biological intercept method. Growth rates in length declined at body sizes > 14 mm L-S. High freshwater discharge through the Chikugo River was associated with high temperatures of the upper Ariake Bay where the larvae spend their planktonic life. Mean larval stage duration (days) from hatch to 15 mm (D-15) varied between 48.8 and 76.2 days and was inversely correlated with the estimated mean temperature history [mean daily temperature (degrees C) experienced by the larvae during the period from hatch to 15 mm, T-15]. Mean abundance (number m(-2)) of larvae and juveniles was highest in years when T-15, D-15 and freshwater discharge were at intermediate levels. Although the abundance was not correlated with either of these variables, an exponential relationship between abundance and D-15 was found when data collected during the highest river discharge years (1990, 1991 and 1998) were excluded. The increase in freshwater discharge through the Chikugo River probably had the potential to enhance or diminish Japanese seaperch recruitment in two ways: 1) it could increase recruitment probability by increasing temperature and larval growth and 2) high river flow also had the potential to decrease the probability of immigration into the river by increasing larval seaward dispersion, predation due to decreased turbidity and starvation due to decreased zooplankton prey abundance in the estuary.

J	Hill, Jason M.; Lloyd, John D.; McFarland, Kent P.; Rimmer, Christopher C.								Apparent survival of a range-restricted montane forest bird species is influenced by weather throughout the annual cycle								AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY				14	2					16	10.5751/ACE-01462-140216				DEC 2019	2019	To conserve small and fragmented populations, we need an understanding of their population dynamics. With a global population estimate of < 120,000, Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is considered one of the Nearctic-Neotropical migrants at greatest risk of extinction. This range-restricted songbird breeds in high-elevation fir (Abies balsamea) forests of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, and primarily overwinters in forests of the Dominican Republic. The Conservation Action Plan for Bicknell's Thrush identifies numerous actions that may help stem population declines and promote recovery of the species, yet the empirical data needed to prioritize among these actions are lacking. We fit Cormack-Jolly-Seber models with mark-recapture data to test a series of hypotheses about the factors that limit apparent survival in 178 adult Bicknell"s Thrush (50 females and 128 males) captured on the breeding grounds in Vermont (June-July, 2001-2015). We focused on putatively important factors from throughout their annual cycle: cyclical population dynamics of nest predators, and weather effects on food abundance on the breeding and wintering grounds. Apparent survival of Bicknell's Thrush was relatively stable (mean Phi = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.68) over our 15-year study, and most strongly associated with fir mast production. Apparent survival was higher following years during which fir trees produced large mast crops (mean Phi = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.79), compared to following nonmast years (Phi = 0.56 +/- 0.06, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.68). These results are likely driven by the reduced red squirrel density and increased nesting success and site fidelity of adult thrushes following nonmast years. Apparent survival of Bicknell's Thrush was also associated with relatively wet conditions on the wintering grounds in Hispaniola as assessed via the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation index (ESPI). These relatively wet December-March periods are likely linked to greater primary productivity and the local availability of fruits and arthropods consumed by Bicknell's Thrush. Our research provides the most comprehensive examination of potentially limiting factors on Bicknell's Thrush populations to date and suggests future avenues of research exploring the relationship between food availability, survival, and climate change induced reductions in rainfall for the Greater Antilles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1712-6568			WOS:000510174100016		
J	Marone, L; Horno, M								Seed reserves in the central Monte Desert, Argentina: implications for granivory								JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS				36	4			661	670		10.1006/jare.1996.0187				AUG 1997	1997	It has been suggested that lower rates of granivory in South American warm deserts compared to their Noah American counterparts arose from a reduction of seed reserves in the former owing to the extinction of argyrolagid marsupials. We measured seed reserves in two habitats of the central Monte Desert in an attempt to detect such seed decline, but to no avail. After moderate rainfall, maximum seed standing crops reached 16,000 and 23,000 seeds m(-2) in shrublands and open forests, respectively. Under the canopy of trees and shrubs there were 19,000 and 37,000 seeds m(-2); whereas in exposed areas there were c. 10,000 seeds m(-2) in both habitats. Seed banks in other South American semi-arid areas showed similar values. Total grass seeds as well as those presumably preferred by ants also seem to be similar in both continents. Hence, granivory in South America, as has been already reported for Australia, is lower than in North America in spite of the great similarity of seed bank sizes. Moreover, argyrolagids were unlikely seed-hoarding granivores, therefore some other reason than argyrolagid extinction should be sought to explain the lack of specialized seed-eating mammals, and the smaller overall seed consumption rates in South American deserts.

In deep transparent lakes of Patagonia, the dark pigmented mixotrophic ciliate Stentor araucanus inhabits the upper layers of the epilimnion and is resistant to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Here, we investigated if the ciliate pigment called stentorin increases oxidative stress in its predators. We studied the DVM behavior of Mesocyclops araucanus and the presence of stentorin in field-collected copepods and evaluated in the laboratory the rate at which the copepod releases stentorin. S. araucanus has a C : P ratio similar to 170 (atomic), which is one half of that of the bulk seston of the lake resulting in a very good food source in a system with very low food quality. Compared to an alternative prey without stentorin, when feeding on Stentor, the copepod suffered high oxidative stress (increased glutathione S-transferase activity) and the reduced glutathion levels increased from dark to visible and ultraviolet radiation. However, we also determined that exposure to only visible light was sufficient to cause oxidative stress. In the field, we observed that M. araucanus displays a larger amplitude DVM than other crustaceans, while the ciliate Stentor remained in the upper levels of the epilimnion. The DVM protects the copepods from stentorin-induced oxidative stress during daytime. Our findings are the first to show that a compound of a zooplankton prey item can influence the vertical behavior of predators in order to minimize the negative effect.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000427104700030		
J	Zajac, Roman; Kelly, Erin; Perry, Danielle; Espinosa, Ivana								Population ecology of the snail Melampus bidentatus in changing salt marsh landscapes								MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE				38	2					e12420	10.1111/maec.12420				APR 2017	2017	We studied the population ecology of the snail Melampus bidentatus in relation to patch composition and landscape structure across several salt marsh systems in Connecticut, USA. These marshes have changed significantly over the past 40-50 years including loss of total area, increased areas of short Spartina alterniflora, and decreased areas and fragmentation of Spartina patens. These changes are consistent with tidal inundation patterns that indicate frequent flooding of high marsh areas. Melampus bidentatus densities were highly variable, both among different salt marsh systems and locations within specific marshes, but were generally similar among short Sp.alterniflora and Sp.patens patches within locations. Densities were lowest where the marsh was regularly inundated at high tide and only remnant Sp.patens patches remained. Almost no snails were found in bare patches. Areas that had large Sp.patens patches adjacent to short Sp.alterniflora supported the highest M.bidentatus densities. Population size-structure varied significantly among patch types, with higher proportions of large individuals in short Sp.alterniflora and hummocked Sp.patens patches than in large and remnant Sp.patens patches. This was likely due to size-selective predation and/or higher snail growth rates due to better food resource conditions in short Sp.alterniflora patches. Egg mass densities and the number of eggs per egg mass were highest in short Sp.alterniflora. Our results indicate that M.bidentatus is resilient to the level and patterns of salt marsh change evident at our study sites. Indeed, snail densities were significantly higher than reported in other field studies, suggesting that increased patch areas of short Sp.alterniflora and associated environmental conditions at our study sites may provide more favorable habitats than previously when marshes were dominated by extensive Sp.patens meadows. However, there may be threshold conditions that could overwhelm the ability of M.bidentatus to maintain itself within salt marsh systems where changes in hydrology, sedimentation and other factors lead to increased numbers of bare patches and ponds and loss of short Sp.alterniflora and Sp.patens.

Therefore, a nutrition trial was performed to contribute to the production of the Brazilian sardine, Sardinella brasiliensis, for use as live bait. This study determined the best dietary carbohydrate to lipid ratio (CHO:L) for juvenile Brazilian sardines based on growth performance, feed utilisation, body composition, blood metabolites and digestive enzyme activity. Six isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets were formulated with increased CHO:L ratios (2.05, 3.41, 4.15, 5.11, 5.80 and 6.72). Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 100 fish with mean initial body weight of 2.97 +/- 0.51g, which were fed four times a day to apparent satiation. Survival was not affected by differences in diet, however, a low CHO:L ratio stimulated growth. Juveniles fed with a rich-carbohydrate diet inhibit feed intake and protein intake. Body lipid increased as dietary lipid increased and was inversely correlated to body moisture. The diets did not affect the juvenile's blood metabolites. Alkaline and acid protease activities were not significantly different, but lipase and amylase responded positively to the dietary lipids and carbohydrates. Using segmented regression, the optimum CHO:L ratio for maximum weight gain of juvenile Brazilian sardines was estimated to be 3.41, which contain approximately 300gkg(-1) carbohydrate and 88gkg(-1) lipid.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000407278400046

We used a dataset of recaptured coded wire tagged hatchery Chinook salmon to estimate early growth and cohort survival. Ocean conditions during the period of early ocean entry were based on output from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model configured for the broader California Current region. We built generalized additive and generalized linear models to describe growth and survival and used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to determine which hatchery and ocean covariates related best to response variables. With regards to hatchery covariates, growth was best explained by release location, while survival was best explained by release weight and hatchery of origin. The ocean conditions included in the best models for both growth and survival included diatoms, predatory zooplankton, temperature, and currents. We observed the highest rates of salmon survival when in situ physical ocean conditions were indicative of relaxation events. For all four ocean covariates, the response curves illustrated opposite patterns between growth and survival models. This result implies that during periods of low survival, juvenile salmon were either 1) growing at a faster rate, or 2) growth appeared to increase because smaller fish had a higher mortality rate than larger fish. The first explanation would imply density-dependence, whereas the second explanation would imply size-selective mortality. These alternatives have implications on hatchery practices including salmon size at release and number of salmon in release groups.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000388829900004

The objective of this research is to evaluate the consumption capacity of Cycloneda sanguinea (Linnaeus, 1763) and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville, 1842 (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) on these aphid species, in order to obtain information for biological control programs. Ten larvae of each predator species were fed with aphids of small size (nymphs of 1st and 2nd instars), and 10 with aphids of medium size (nymphs of 3rd and 4th instars), maintained under 15ºC, 20ºC and 25ºC, 12 h photophase and 70 ± 10% relative humidity. The aphids were counted every 24 hours, replacing those that were consumed. The total consumption of Cinara by the larvae of C. sanguinea was not statistically different at the three temperatures: 325.5; 322.2 and 324.8 of small aphids and 121.3; 140.4 and 109.9 of medium ones, respectively at 15ºC, 20ºC and 25ºC. The consumption by H. convergens was higher than by C. sanguinea and increased noticeably with temperature: 444 aphids at 15ºC; 491.3 at 20ºC and 513.3 at 25ºC, considering the small aphids, and 187.1; 205.1 and 216.6 of medium aphids at the three temperatures. The small aphids weigh about half as much as medium ones and were preferred by all larval instars probably because they are easier to manipulate than the large ones. Both predators, especially the 4th instar larvae, showed high consumption capacity on the Cinara nymphs at all temperatures and can be regarded as promising biological control agents.									6	0	0	0	4	5	9			1806-9665			SCIELO:S0085-56262003000400004

Locomotory activity (distance covered, time spent walking, walking speed, angular velocity, and turning rate) was recorded at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C and relative humidity levels of 33%, 65% and 90% RH on tomato, pepper, aubergine and cucumber and analysed using video/computer techniques. The results show that activity of S. punctillum significantly increased at higher temperatures. Host plant species also strongly influenced the performance of the predator, which was most active on pepper and tomato and least active on aubergine. Relative humidity had no significant influence.									27	2	0	0	30	1	34			1386-6141			WOS:000088025800002

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				285	2			85	92		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00817.x				SEP 2011	2011	In ectotherms, decreasing season length and lower temperature towards higher latitudes often favour higher growth and developmental rates. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms and particularly the hormonal correlates of clinal variation remain unexplored. The growth hormone (GH) plays a crucial role in growth of all vertebrates and high expression of GH is associated with rapid growth in many species. We tested the hypothesis that GH expression is correlated with a latitudinal gradient in growth in Scandinavian Rana temporaria tadpoles. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we measured GH and growth hormone receptor (GHR) expression at two time points from laboratory-raised tadpoles originating from eight populations collected along the latitudinal gradient. To explore latitudinal differences in stress-induced changes in GH expression, we also compared GH expression in tadpoles raised with and without predators. In accordance with previous studies we found a clear latitudinal gradient in growth. There were no latitudinal effects, or predator-induced effects on GH or GHR expression. However, there was some indication for among-population variation in GH expression. The lack of a latitudinal pattern in GH and GHR expression may be due to that the growth promoting effects of GH is dependent on other factors including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF), IGF-binding proteins or prolactin. Further studies on these factors may provide insight on the proximal mechanisms of differences in growth in R. temporaria tadpoles.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000295095000002

Therefore, we predicted that antipredator behavior, here measured as escape behavior when captured by a human, would correlate with risk of parasite infection at the interspecific level with bolder species having more parasites than risk-averse species. Here we tested whether species with more active escape behavior also tended to have high prevalence of blood parasites, specifically hemosporidian parasites. Focusing on effect sizes we found that escape behavior was intermediately and positively related to prevalence of infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas that was not the case for the more virulent Plasmodium. Species that were habitat generalists and hence encountered a greater diversity of habitats had higher prevalence of blood parasites than specialists. In addition, some components of escape behavior were correlated at an intermediate magnitude with habitat exploration, as reflected by the relative frequency of feeding innovations, and coloniality. We failed to find considerable patterns of correlations between most of the behavioral variables and flight initiation distance, another commonly used antipredator behavior. Therefore, behavioral responses to an approaching predator and to being caught by a human likely represent 2 independent axes of antipredator behavior that do not evolve in concert. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that escape behavior is related to risk of infection with blood parasites partially mediated by the effect of habitat generalism.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000340048200029

This:was done by examining prey items removed-from the coelenterons at regular intervals after feeding and assessing their degree of digestion according to a predetermined scale. There was considerable variation in the gut retention times between different anemone species offered the same prey types, with Actinia equina consistently showing the shortest gut retention times (12 h for amphipods, 15 h for pelecypods and 23 h for isopods). Of the various prey categories tested, amphipods tended to be the most rapidly digested group, while molluscs and echinoderms usually remained in the coelenteron the longest. Mean gut retention times in B. reynaudi, the only species found both in False Bay (17 degrees C) and on the cold west coast (12 degrees C) were markedly longer (72 vs 60 h and 43 vs 30 h for pelecypods and gastropods respectively) at the lower temperature.									7	0	0	0	6	2	7			0254-1858			WOS:000072275400001

For possible use of Euborellia annulipes (Lucas) (Anisolabididae) in biological control programs against the cotton boll weevil Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Curculionidae), it is important to know the effect of temperature on reproduction in this predator. Our objective was to evaluate the reproductive potential and the longevity of females of E. annulipes under laboratory conditions using an artificial diet, at 25 and 30degreesC, and to estimate life-fertility tables and growth rates. Fecundity began to decline on clay 84 at 25degreesC and on day 74 at 30degreesC of adult age and ended with the death of the females at both temperatures. Females of E. annulipes oviposited an average of 206 and 306 eggs, and had a mean longevity of 198 and 149 d at 25 and 30degreesC, respectively. The gross reproductive rates were 89.2 at 25degreesC and 91.4 at 30degreesC; the net reproductive rates were 65.3 at 25degreesC and 40.3 at 30degreesC; the generation times were 195.2 d at 25degreesC and 142.9 d at 30degreesC; the doubling time was 33.0 d at 25degreesC and 26.7 d at 30degreesC; the intrinsic rates of increase were 0.02 at 25degreesC and 0.03 at 30degreesC, and the finite rates of increase were 1.02 at 25degreesC and 1.03 at 30degreesC. The predator population increased by 52 at 25degreesC and 20 at 30degreesC adult progeny per female per generation in the laboratory. The best age for inoculative releases of E. annulipes against cotton boll weevil populations is the age with the highest age-specific reproductive values, that is, newly emerged females at 25 or 30degreesC.									18	0	0	0	17	1	19			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000184052100023

PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECTION EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY OF THE NETHERLANDS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY (NEV)								77	85						1998	1998	Cattle grazing of old Deschampsia fields increases numbers of Stenobothrus stigmaticus, possibly by improving food quality or accessibility. Experimental feeding with grass from grazed fields, however, does not enlarge grasshopper survival, growth and egg production, as compared to feeding with grass from ungrazed controls. Reduction of predators, more suitable vegetation structure for grasshopper mobility and higher temperature maxima in the egg environment are more likely causes for the increase of S. stigmaticus under the influence of grazing.					9th Meeting of the Experimental and Applied Entomologists9th Meeting of the Experimental and Applied Entomologists	DEC   19, 1997DEC   19, 1997	Netherlands Entomolog Soc (NEV); Koppert Biolog Syst; Boekhandel Kooyker GinsbergNetherlands Entomolog Soc (NEV); Koppert Biolog Syst; Boekhandel Kooyker Ginsberg	ACAD BLDG LEIDEN UNIV, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDSACAD BLDG LEIDEN UNIV, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	1	0	2					90-71912-17-5	WOS:000077659400013		
J	Horn, W								Long-term development of the crustacean plankton in the Saidenbach Reservoir (Germany) - changes, causes, consequences								HYDROBIOLOGIA				504	1-3			185	192		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008518.30455.5e				SEP 1 2003	2003	The drinking water reservoir Saidenbach (Germany) has been investigated continuously from the year 1975 onwards. Since 1987, daphnids (Daphnia galeata)-an essential component in the cycle of matter and energy in the pelagic zone of reservoirs and lakes-became less and less abundant. Its total and relative biomass declined drastically and the exponential population growth began later in the year. After 1990, also the biomass of the copepods decreased significantly. Thus, the total crustacean biomass declined from 0.35 cm(3) m(-3) (mean 1975-1990) to 0.22 cm(3) m(-3) in the 1990s. Top-down effects seem to be responsible for all these changes, because stocks of both native planktivorous fishes, mainly roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), and non-native silver carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have increased over the years. A second observation confirms this conclusion: the significant temperature effects on the growth rate of Daphnia observed every year in early summer (May) in the first years under investigation were not detectable anymore after the year 1987. Since then, the exponential population development did not start until end of June/beginning of July. This delay and the substantial decrease of the mean body length of the daphnids are clear indications for the enormous predation pressure on this zooplankton group. Simultaneously, the concentration of nanoplankton increased and the Secchi depth decreased indicating the diminishing impact of crustaceans on phytoplankton in the course of the years. Thus, a significant relationship between the concentration of Daphnia and the water transparency could be obtained-a confirmation of their great importance for the water clarity. Consequently, if Daphnia shall provide a positive contribution to water quality (e.g., by effective particle elimination), a well structured fish community with regard to species composition, size structure, standing stock and functional groups will be needed as a prerequisite.					4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality	AUG, 2002AUG, 2002		CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLICCESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC	18	4	0	0	18	1	23			0018-8158			WOS:000188316100019

The ladybeetle Oenopia conglobata (L.) is a natural enemy of many herbivores, particularly aphids. The temperature-dependent development of O. conglobata was studied at six constant temperatures (22.5, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5 and 35 degrees C) to understand its development rate and environmental constraints better. Linear and nonlinear (Lactin) models were fitted to the data. In the thermal range from 22.5 to 32.5 degrees C, the rate of development increased for all stages; 35 degrees C was lethal for all stages and no eggs hatched. The Tb and K values for the biological cycle (egg-adult) were 8.84 degrees C and 263.15 DD, respectively. Depending on the model, t(min) values for the total development time of the coccinellid ranged from 8.45 to 8.82 degrees C. The nonlinear model of Lactin estimated the optimum and upper temperature thresholds for the total development time of the ladybeetle to be 33.2 and 35.0 degrees C, respectively. High R-2 values and low residual sum of squares values revealed a good fit to the experimental data for total development and different developmental stages of O. conglobata. The results may contribute to the improvement of practical methods for mass rearing of O. conglobata.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1742-7584	1742-7592		WOS:000447805900018

At Dassen Island, the proportion of burrows occupied for breeding by African penguins from 1995 to 2008 was affected positively by the interaction between the overall biomass of sardine and anchovy. However, sardine had a positive effect while anchovy had a negative one. This unexpected negative relationship may result from a reduced local availability of anchovy linked to the fishing effort that continued to be focussed in the vicinity of Dassen Island, while the growing anchovy stock experienced an eastward shift away from Dassen Island in recent years, creating a spatial mismatch between penguin and available anchovy. A decrease of the Southern Oscillation Index tended to advance the onset of penguins' breeding, as did an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) at the sardine and anchovy spawning grounds. An increase in SST at the nursery and spawning areas tended to decrease the penguin per capita growth rate. Earlier breeding resulted in decreased chick production, possibly because it created a temporal mismatch between chick rearing and winter availability of young-of-the-year anchovy and sardine along South Africa's west coast. The local abundance of prey is more important for breeding African penguins than overall fish abundance. Consequently, management of the purse-seine fishery should be adjusted spatially in order to ensure adequate local food supplies for breeding African penguins.									21	0	0	0	19	0	21			0171-8630			WOS:000285419300022

Estimates of production have steadily increased from 11 gC m(-2) y(-1) in 1979 to 80 gC m(-2) y(-1) in 1987. Since 1988, extensive measurements of copepod egg production and moulting rates of Calanus agulhensis at sea during hydro-acoustic fisheries surveys over the south and west coasts of South Africa in November have provided more direct estimates of copepod production. Daily Mean Production :Mean Biomass(P:B) ratios varied between 0.1 and 0.3 and annual production ranged between 17 and 150 gC m(-2) y(-1). Copepod biomass, distribution, and demographic structure varied between cruises in different years, apparently linked to both the abundance of predators and shifts in hydrology. Production appeared to be due more to shifts in distribution of biomass and demography of Calanus than to variations in growth rates. Poor correlations existed between juvenile growth and female egg production, suggesting one is unable to predict population growth from egg production rates only. Weak correlations between growth rates of different stages also suggest that the only meaningful measure of copepod production requires all stages to be incubated.

Influence of temperature on spring flight initiation for southwestern ponderosa pine bark beetles (Coleoptera : Curculionidae, Scolytinae)								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				37	1			57	69		10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[57:IOTOSF]2.0.CO;2				FEB 2008	2008	Determination of temperature requirements for many economically important insects is a cornerstone of pest management. For bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), this information can facilitate timing of management strategies. Our goals were to determine temperature predictors for flight initiation of three species of Ips bark beetles, five species of Dendroctonus bark beetles, and two genera of bark beetle predators, Enoclerus spp. (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Coleoptera: Ostomidae), in ponderosa pine forests of northcentral Arizona. We quantified beetle flight activity using data loggers and pheromone-baited funnel traps at 18 sites over 4 yr. Ambient air temperature was monitored using temperature data loggers located in close proximity to funnel traps. We analyzed degree-day accumulation and differences between minimum, average, and maximum ambient temperature for the week before and week of first beetle capture to calculate flight temperature thresholds. Degree-day accumulation was not a good predictor for initiation of beetle flight. For all species analyzed other than D. adjunctus Blandford, beetles were captured in traps only when springtime temperatures exceeded 15.0 degrees C. D. adjunctus was collected when maximum temperatures reached only 14.5 degrees C. Once initial flights had begun, beetles were often captured when maximum ambient air temperatures were below initial threshold temperatures.

The match-mismatch hypothesis posits that predators time energy-intensive activities, such as reproduction, to periods of high food availability. However, predators may be constrained by various ecological or physiological processes, leading to mistimed activities relative to prey availability. We investigated inter-annual variation in the timing of breeding for a piscivorous seabird (rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata) in relation to availability of a preferred prey item, Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus, using data collected over 18 yr between 1984 and 2006 at Teuri Island in the northern Japan Sea. Our primary goals were (1) to identify the climatic factors that affect the seabirds' timing of breeding, proxied by hatching date, and anchovy seasonal availability, and (2) to quantify the fitness effects of predator-prey matches and mismatches relative to climate variability. Hatching date was later in years with lower spring air temperatures. Auklets switched their feeding from sandlance and juvenile greenling to anchovy when it was transported into the birds' foraging range with the seasonal northern expansion of 13 degrees C warm water from the south. The mismatch between hatching date and the period of high anchovy availability was most pronounced when spring air temperatures were warm, and there was a weak Tsushima (warm) Current. Spring air temperature was influenced by spring atmospheric pressure gradients in the Arctic and northern Eurasia, which drive the east Asian winter monsoon, whereas timing of the Tsushima warm water expansion was influenced by winter surface pressures over the western North Pacific. Chick growth rates, mass at fledging, and overall fledging success (fitness) were lower during mismatch years when the auklets fed less on anchovy. The auklets were constrained to adjust hatching date because the seasonal mismatch appeared to be driven by independent and unpredictable surface pressure patterns.									38	0	0	0	38	0	40			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000272187800022		
J	WALLIN, H								MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND FORAGING TACTICS OF A CATERPILLAR HUNTER INHABITING ALFALFA FIELDS								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				5	6			740	749		10.2307/2389536				1991	1991	Hunger level influences a predator's motivation to search for food. Whilst foraging a predator may be faced with situations involving a trade-off between energetic gain during feeding or the pursuit of other activities that are necessary for survival and reproduction. The movements of the caterpillar hunter Calosoma affine Chaudoir were studied in short (recently cut) and full-grown (tall) alfalfa by tracking beetles in the field at night, using a portable harmonic radar system. Full-grown alfalfa contained high densities of prey for Calosoma affine (during an outbreak of alfalfa caterpillars/armyworms), while stubble fields, i.e. short alfalfa, represented low prey densities.Hungry Calosoma affine displayed directed movements in short alfalfa (low prey density), whereas the movement pattern of hungry beetles in full-grown alfalfa (high prey density) could be described as a correlated random walk related to near-search activities; foraging inside the base of crown stems. Satiated beetles moved randomly, i.e. displayed a correlated random walk within both short and full-grown alfalfa. Satiated beetles, only, climbed and foraged in the plant canopy. The longest distance covered and the velocity were highest for hungry beetles tracked in short alfalfa. A significant reduction in speed was obtained for hungry beetles in full-grown alfalfa, while satiated beetles exhibited a similar speed within the different growth stages of alfalfa.Time to ingest caterpillars/armyworms, biomass gained per minute, and the amount of prey traces left after feeding, increased with increasing size of the prey. Mean biomass ingested increased with increasing temperature. However, the overall rate of ingestion decreased with time due to satiation.The influence of motivation on predatory movements displayed by adult Calosoma affine within short and full-grown alfalfa is compared with differences in prey density and prey availability. Moreover, the foraging behaviour exhibited by Calosoma affine within extrinsic (temperature) constraints, and the importance of energy requirements for various parameters of the time budget are discussed.									34	1	0	0	29	0	35			0269-8463			WOS:A1991GU30500004

PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				91	4			382	396		10.1016/j.pocean.2011.04.001				DEC 2011	2011	Besides variable egg survival, previous studies suggested that the larval stage may be the most critical phase in determining Baltic cod recruitment variability, and that larvae need to conduct an ontogenetic vertical migration from hatching depths (>50 m) to upper layers with increased food availability in order to initiate first feeding, improve their nutritional condition and growth, and avoid starvation. Recently, detailed information on the stage-resolved vertical distribution of main Baltic copepod species, including the preferred larval Baltic cod prey species Pseudocalanus acuspes, has become available. Therefore, the vertical distribution of Baltic cod larvae in August 2007 and their depth-dependent nutritional condition and growth were investigated. RNA-DNA based methods were used to estimate growth, including a novel approach to estimate growth performance by relating observed specific growth rates (SGR) of field caught larvae to temperature-dependent reference growth rates (G(ref)) for fast-growing laboratory reared fish from the literature. This standardization to G(ref) was found to have a great potential to improve investigations on the growth and ecology of larval fish. The need for early larvae to migrate to shallower layers was corroborated, while larger size classes were found at increasingly greater depths. This may reflect a continuation of the ontogenetic vertical migration in order to follow increasingly larger prey items at greater depths and to save energy in cooler waters below the thermocline. Larval growth generally declined with increasing depth, but the decline in growth became less pronounced in larger size classes. This indicates that larger larvae were better in coping with the ambient environment and the available prey field at greater depths. Generally, Baltic cod larvae grew poorly compared to larvae from other studies, which is discussed in relation to differences in predation and a possible food-temperature trade-off for larvae in the highly stratified Baltic Sea. Comparison with earlier results showed a higher frequency of starving larvae and lower frequencies of larger larvae after the first-feeding stage in 1994 and 1995. As this was a period of low Baltic cod recruitment despite favourable conditions for egg survival, it is concluded that larval starvation mortality has a high potential to contribute to recruitment variability in Baltic cod.

We investigated the natural history and predatory impact of one group of such mesopredators-larvae of dipteran flies in the genus Oedoparena-which prey on intertidal barnacles. We 1) quantified patterns of larval Oedoparena distribution and abundance in the Northwest Straits of Washington State, USA, 2) determined larval physiological tolerance limits in the laboratory, and 3) conducted a manipulative field experiment to assess the role of microhabitat temperature on predation rates in Oedoparena. Members of Oedoparena in Washington are univoltine, with peak larval abundance in late spring and early summer. Infestation frequencies in the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli were as high as 22% and 35%, respectively. In laboratory studies, larvae of O. glauca were able to tolerate temperatures up to 37degreesC; however, this temperature is often exceeded in high intertidal habitats. In a field manipulation using experimental shades, we demonstrate that the alleviation of physiological stress greatly increased the abundance of larvae of Oedoparena spp. As a result of increased larval densities under shades, adult B. glandula mortality increased from 5% to nearly 30%, and C. dalli mortality increased from less than 20% to over 60%. Because high intertidal barnacles serve as food and habitat for a diverse array of species, Oedoparena spp. have the potential to play a major role in structuring high intertidal communities, particularly in cooler microhabitats.									24	0	0	0	22	0	24			1077-8306			WOS:000182225900007

It is characterised by the following features: a denticulate ridge in addition to the dorsal claw-like tooth, a small tooth-like swelling at the stegostom base, ca 26 longitudinal ridges on the female body, a uterine sac associated with two dumb-bell-shaped pouches, relatively small spicules (30-38 mu m long), a simple gubernaculum shorter than half the spicule length, the genital subventral papillae (v6) consisting of three very small papillae, and a long filiform tail (female: 391-550 mu m, 18-26 anal body diam.; male: 304-548 mu m, 19-30 anal body diam.). Phylogenetic analyses placed the new species together with M. striatus, sister to Tylopharynr foetida. Since the use of nematodes as functional indicators often relies on the allocation of nematodes to feeding groups, experiments were performed to elucidate the feeding strategy of the new species. Both its ability to move actively to bacterial food sources and to prey on other compost nematodes were tested. Mononchoides composticola n. sp. actively moved towards the compost bacterium Achromobacter, a taxis that was temperature dependent, and also preyed on other nematodes. Predation was selective, with a higher predation rate on the relatively small and slow-moving Rhabditella sp. than on the considerably larger and more motile Rhabditis (Poikilolaimus) sp. Adults of M. composticola n. sp. have a dual feeding behaviour and can apparently alternate between bacterial and nematode prey.									23	0	0	0	23	0	24			1388-5545			WOS:000289025400008

In the laboratory, embryonic development depended on temperature and averaged 12 days at alternating temperatures (25/15 degrees C), mean duration of the postembryonic period was 58 days at this temperature. Prey consumption of the N. elongatum larvae (three instars) was approximate to 30 bark beetles (larvae, respectively, pupae) per individual. The adult longevity averaged 3-5 months and mean fecundity was 63.6 eggs per female at alternating temperature (20/10 degrees C) and 58.4 eggs at constant temperature (22 degrees C). The prey consumption of the N. elongatum imagines also depended on temperature. At alternating temperatures (20/10 degrees C) the mean prey consumption was approximately one bark beetle adult per day and N. elongatum individual. Due to these data this predator species must be considered as an important and effective antagonist of Pityogenes chalcographus.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0931-2048			WOS:A1996VG89500002

Differential tolerances to OA between species at different trophic levels, for example, may alter species interactions and impact community stability. Here we evaluate the effect of OA on the larval stages of the rock oyster, Saccostrea cucullata, a dominant Indo-Pacific ecosystem engineer, and its key predator, the whelk, Reishia clavigera. pH as low as 7.4 had no significant effect on mortality, abnormality or growth of oyster larvae, whereas whelk larvae exposed to pH 7.4 experienced increased mortality (up to similar to 30%), abnormalities (up to 60%) and similar to 3 times higher metabolic rates compared to controls. Although these impacts' long-term consequences are yet to be investigated, greater vulnerability of whelk larvae to OA could impact predation rates on intertidal rocky shores, and have implications for subsequent community dynamics.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0141-1136	1879-0291		WOS:000450376700008	30115535

We hypothesized that the contracted border at sites that experienced low tidal currents was due to flow-medisted recruitment that resulted in reduced survival due to the absence of neighbor buffering of thermal stress (i.e., positive intraspecific interactions). We tested this hypothesis by manipulating the density of recently settled barnacles and their thermal environment in a field experiment. Counter to our original hypothesis, barnacles with neighbors suffered severe mortality at low-flow sites. When density-dependent predation by the green crab (Carcinus maenus) was experimentally eliminated, however, we did detect evidence for positive interactions at the low-flow sites but not at the high-how sites. In spite of the close proximity of the sites, maximum daily rock temperatures at the low-flow sites were slightly, but consistently, greater than those at high-flow sites. Our findings suggest that the upper intertidal border of S. balanoides in the Damariscotta River is limited at low-flow sites by a combination of reduced recruitment, elevated mortality from thermal stress and enhanced predation by green crabs. More generally, oar findings highlight how physical stress and predation interact to alter the nature of density-dependent species interactions in natural assemblages.									34	0	0	0	32	0	35			0029-8549			WOS:000079555700012	28307417

In the south, C fornicata may reach abundances of several thousand individuals per meter squared accompanied by diverse ecological and economic effects. In contrast, abundances at northern waters as in Germany, Denmark and Norway barely reach 100 ind. m(-2), indicating one or several limiting factors for population increase. By studying a population in the northern Wadden Sea of Germany, we examined four factors that we regarded as likely to potentially limit population increase of C fornicata: (1) high predation by the main benthic molluse predators, (2) high infestation by parasites, (3) low reproductive output and growth in cold waters and (4) high winter mortality during freezing winters. Our results do not indicate biotic restrictions: The main benthic mollusc predators, shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) and sea stars (Asterias rubens) strongly preferred the dominant blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) in choice experiments and no infestation with parasitic trematodes were observed. Further, there was no indication of limitation in reproduction and growth since abundant larvae were observed in the water column and the period of reproduction (April to September) as well as growth rates (recruits: 9-14 mm first summer) match with data from southern areas. In contrast, population dynamics of C. fornicata was strongly affected by cold winters: During the two winters investigated, mortality amounted to 56-64% with up to 97% on single mussel beds contrasting to 11-14% yearly mortality in areas without frost in southern Europe. Negative winter effects are also suggested by remarkably low larval abundances after an exceptionally severe winter. Our results suggest that winter mortality is the main limiting factor for population increase of C fornicata in the study area. We propose that milder winters as a corollary of global warming may allow for an increase in the abundance of northern populations combined with a northward shift of the concomitant negative ecological and economic effects.

Understanding the limits of consumption is important for determining trophic influences on ecosystems and predator adaptations to inconsistent prey availability. Fishes have been observed to consume beyond what is sustainable (i.e. digested on a daily basis), but this phenomenon of hyperphagia (or binge-feeding) is largely overlooked. We expect hyperphagia to be a short-term (1-day) event that is facilitated by gut volume providing capacity to store consumed food during periods of high prey availability to be later digested.2. We define how temperature, body size and food availability influence the degree of binge-feeding by comparing field observations with laboratory experiments of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), a large freshwater piscivore that experiences highly variable prey pulses. We also simulated bull trout consumption and growth during salmon smolt outmigrations under two scenarios: 1) daily consumption being dependent upon bioenergetically sustainable rates and 2) daily consumption being dependent upon available gut volume (i.e. consumption is equal to gut volume when empty and otherwise 'topping off' based on sustainable digestion rates).3. One-day consumption by laboratory-held bull trout during the first day of feeding experiments after fasting exceeded bioenergetically sustainable rates by 12- to 87-fold at low temperatures (3 degrees C) and by similar to 1.3-fold at 20 degrees C. The degree of binge-feeding by bull trout in the field was slightly reduced but largely in agreement with laboratory estimates, especially when prey availability was extremely high [during a sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolt outmigration and at a counting fence where smolts are funnelled into high densities]. Consumption by bull trout at other settings were lower and more variable, but still regularly hyperphagic.4. Simulations demonstrated the ability to binge-feed increased cumulative consumption (16-32%) and cumulative growth (19-110%) relative to only feeding at bioenergetically sustainable rates during the similar to 1-month smolt outmigration period.5. Our results indicate the ability for predators to maximize short-term consumption when prey are available can be extreme and is limited primarily by gut volume, then mediated by temperature; thus, predator-prey relationships may be more dependent upon prey availability than traditional bioenergetic models suggest. Binge-feeding has important implications for energy budgets of consumers as well as acute predation impacts on prey.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000388353400018	27457279

Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator-prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100years of future protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32% of K, with full recovery predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1% of K) and fin (16,950, <4% of K) whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific southern right numbers are <7% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are key requirements for management and conservation.									22	0	0	0	14	0	22			1467-2960	1467-2979		WOS:000418927100008

Environmental factors, including host availability, temperature and vegetation density (biomass in g km(-2)) were analyzed to assess their impact on leech populations. The study areas supported only low densities (ind. km(-2)) of medicinal leeches, mostly due to agricultural activity which has caused habitat destruction and has gradually limited the distribution of leeches to small, patchy bodies of water. Agricultural activity is seasonal, so leeches are not affected by this activity equally year round. Leeches were most abundant in May/June, were present in small numbers in July/August, and hibernated from December to March 2009 at both sites. Leech density was significantly correlated with amphibian density (biomass in g km(-2)), the major hosts in the sample areas. Temperature and aquatic vegetation densities affected leech numbers directly (temperature influencing leech growth rate and vegetation providing shelter from potential predators) and indirectly (due to the impact of temperature and vegetation on the amphibian population, the leeches' major prey). Leeches of <1 g were found mostly in April and May following hatching, while those >5 g were predominant in September.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1864-7790	1864-7782		WOS:000287668300011

Sablefish Predation on Juvenile Pacific Salmon in the Coastal Marine Waters of Southeast Alaska in 1999								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				138	3			675	691		10.1577/T08-157.1				MAY 2009	2009	A1-sea observations of predation by age-1 and older (age-1+) sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria oil juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. were combined with laboratory studies to determine gastric evacuation rates and were used to estimate summer predation impact in file northern region of Southeast Alaska. In June and July 1999, tip to 63% of sablefish examined from trawl catches in strait habitat had each consumed one to four juvenile pink salmon O. gorbuscha, chum salmon O. keta, or sockeye salmon O. nerka. In two laboratory experiments, field-captured sablefish were acclimated without food in compartmentalized flow-through tanks with conditions manipulated to reflect the photoperiod and temperature regimes of summer. These sablefish were each offered one whole, preweighed juvenile chum salmon: Consumption events were observed, and the sablefish were then sacrificed at predetermined time intervals. Prey biomass remaining in the stomach of each sablefish predator was weighed, and all exponential model of the decline in percent biomass over time was used to yield instantaneous evacuation rates of 0.049 at 12 degrees C and 0.027 at 7 degrees C. From field data combined with model-derived estimates of meal frequency, we estimated that 0.8-6.0 million juvenile salmon were Consumed by age-1+ sablefish in the 500-km(2) area of Icy Strait during a 33-d period. Moreover, a 10-year time series of catches indicated that 1999 was a year of unusually high age-1+ sablefish abundance and relatively low juvenile salmon abundance. We speculate that sablefish predation in 1999 Could have affected abundance of out-migrating juveniles and contributed to low harvests Of returning, adult pink salmon in 2000 and adult churn salmon in 2002. Our results suggest that sablefish predation oil juvenile Pacific salmon call occur during episodic strong year-classes of sablefish and may affect adult salmon returns.									10	1	0	0	11	0	12			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000268501100019

After a period of 24 h at 25 degrees C in 50-mm petri dishes, adult coccinellids attacked 11 eggs and killed 14 first instars and 4 second instars. Fourth-instar coccinellids attacked 9 eggs and killed 11 first instars and 3 second instars. Effect of temperature on predation effectiveness of C. maculata adults, third and fourth instars was studied on potato stems infested with L. decemlineata eggs, first or second instars. No predation activity occurred at 7.5 degrees C. Predator effectiveness increased linearly with temperature in the subsequent 10-30 degrees C temperature range studied. At each temperature, no significant difference in the number of prey killed was observed between C. maculata adults and fourth instars. The use of potato stems in assessing predation by C. maculata significantly reduced the number of prey killed by introducing the need for searching by the predator. Results suggest that inundative releases of third-instar C. maculata against eggs and first instars of Colorado potato beetles could be of interest in the case where releases of adult coccinellids would fail because of their tendency to rapidly fly out of the field.									29	0	0	0	27	0	29			0046-225X			WOS:A1995RE60500035

Survival, growth rates and life-history of this species were studied for the first time in this species. A total of 570 specimens (420 introduced in a new habitat and 150 as control) were marked and monitored over a three-year period. Growth rates observed were mainly related to the availability of microalgal food. The mortality rate of transplanted specimens was high (50% mortality immediately after transplant). Seasonality in growth rates was observed in both control and transplanted specimens, with greater growth rates detected in spring-summer (warm season) than in autumn-winter (cold season). Smaller specimens of P. ferruginea had the greatest growth rates in comparison with the bigger specimens, therefore the potential ability to adapt in a new habitat was higher for small specimens immediately after removal. An elevated growth rate (appearing as a light-ring in the border of the shell) was detected immediately after translocation, following which growth rate progressively stabilized over time. Using differential equations and the von Bertalanffy model, the longevity of P. ferruginea was estimated to range between 8.89 and 35.72 years depending on the environment. Transplantation should not be considered as a conservation measure given the elevated mortality rate.									28	0	0	0	30	0	31			1125-0003	1748-5851		WOS:000261878100005

Samples were collected every autumn between 1993 and 2009. The results showed that the consumption of conspecific individuals was consistent over space and time. The abundance, spatial distribution patterns and L-T structure of M. merluccius recruits were the main variables involved in M. merluccius cannibalism. A geographical pattern was found since increasing cannibalism was observed in areas of recruit aggregations. The L-T spectrum of recruits in autumn was also a key factor and dependent on the spawning period. When adults spawned from late spring to summer, an increasing cannibalism trend was found in autumn, due to the ideal size structure of the prey (M. merluccius recruits) for predators. Depth was also a significant variable, and a cannibal peak was detected at depths ranging between 50 and 200m, coinciding with a spatial overlap of predator (pre-adults) and prey (recruits). The cannibalistic behaviour of M. merluccius began at c. 12cm, although 75% were mid-sized individuals between 16 and 30cm. Additionally, 90% of prey-hake were recruits <185cm. Some biological and ecological aspects such as growth rate, spawning period, predation and competition interactions and the effect of some oceanographic events on M. merluccius cannibalism are also discussed.

The objective of this study was to evaluate growth, survival, and tag retention in hatchery yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juveniles with intracoelomic surgically implanted acoustic transmitters representing 2.6 to 5.6% of body weight. The first trial consisted of three treatments; passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag-only (25 fish), acoustic-tag+PIT-tag (25 fish), and sham-surgery+PIT-tag (25 fish). There were no significant differences in relative growth rate (% change in weight day(-1)) among treatments over the 221 day trial. Survival in the acoustic-tag treatment (80%) was not significantly different from the PIT-tag-only and sham treatments (92 and 88% respectively). The second trial consisted of three treatments; PIT-tag-only (22 fish), acoustic-tag+PIT-tag with absorbable sutures (12 fish) and acoustic-tag+PIT-tag with non-absorbable sutures (12 fish). There were no significant differences in relative growth rate among treatments over the 160 day trial. Survival in the second trial was 100%. Fish with absorbable sutures healed sooner and with less inflammation compared to fish with non-absorbable sutures. Tag retention was 100% in both trials. The results of this study suggest that acoustic transmitters of less than 5.6% body weight can be effectively used in 1-year old Chinook salmon.									25	1	0	0	25	0	26			0378-1909			WOS:000313059000002		
J	Garcia, TS; Stacy, J; Sih, A				Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015	Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663			Larval salamander response to uv radiation and predation risk: Color change and microhabitat use								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				14	4			1055	1064		10.1890/02-5288				AUG 2004	2004	Adaptations to avoid or cope with harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) have evolved in many amphibian species. Sublethal levels of UVR can select for simple responses in larval amphibians, such as dark pigmentation or preference for UVR-protected microhabitats (i.e., under cover or in deep water). This Study focuses on color response to UVR, and whether avoidance behaviors like refuge use and depth choice depend on larval body color. We quantified responses to ambient levels of UVR in four experiments in semi-field conditions using two sister species of salamander larvae that differ in their evolutionary history of UVR exposure. Both Ambystoma barbouri and A. texanum larvae darkened in response to UVR, and when given the choice of refuge, significantly increased the proportion of time spent in hiding. Additionally, both species used deeper microhabitats when exposed to UVR, but only A. barbouri larvae showed a preference for shallow waters when UVR was blocked out. Neither of these behaviors seemed to be color dependent, with larvae from both species taking refuge and preferring deep water in the presence of UVR, regardless of body color. Interesting behavioral trade-offs arose when larvae were confronted with conflicting selection pressures from UVR and predation risk. Risk from predatory fish forces larvae to shallow areas, while UVR forces larvae into deeper water. Thus, the combination of the two selection pressures creates a conflict in optimal depth choice. Faced with this conflict, A. barbouri preferred deeper, risky areas to shallow water with high UVR exposure. Ambystoma texanum responded to predation risk with a preference for shallow water, but did not significantly alter depth in response to UVR. Given the opportunity to mediate exposure to UVR and predation risk by altering depth choices, neither species changed color in response to either UVR or predation risk. Overall, these changes in behavior and color may affect larval feeding, competition, and predation rates and could thus alter aquatic community structure.									28	0	0	0	31	0	31			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000223156600009

In a first experiment, groups of recently fed guppies, placed in a novel environment, schooled significantly more closely at 26 degrees than at 22 degrees C. Changes in two of three measures of schooling tendency over time indicated that aggregation increased during the trial periods, probably as a result of increased familiarity within the experimental groups. In a second experiment, pairs of female guppies were tested at 22 degrees and 26 degrees C, with and without predation threat from a confined cichlid. From multifactor analysis of 18 behaviour types, temperature was shown to affect behavioural time budgets profoundly, particularly in the presence of the predator. At the higher temperature, a shift occurred from inactive anti-predator behaviours and minimal foraging activity towards active predator inspection-related behaviours and a much higher level of feeding. Guppies in the warmer water might have been physically able to school more closely as a result of faster swimming ability, or might have used temperature as a cue indicating higher potential predation risk, and aggregated accordingly. The use of temperature as a source of information about the biotic environment is discussed.

Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.									13	0	0	0	9	0	13			1612-4758			WOS:000289850600003

Young individuals of Z. nagae ranging from 4.1-7.6 mm in body length were used for the experiments with adult females of the copepod Acartia steueri as prey. The mean digestion time of Z. nagae was 115 +/- 3 minutes at 20 degrees C. Temporal change in individual's feeding intensity was observed every 1.5 h for 24 h to determine the diel feeding pattern, feeding interval, feeding rates and daily ration. Almost all individuals showed no clear diel rhythm within 24-h at 20 degrees C under 12L:12D cycle; time interval between feeding was 4.5-6 h (mode) for individuals that ingested multiple copepods. The number of copepods ingested by a chaetognath ranged from 0 to 5 and on average 2.6 copepods were consumed a day per individual. Specific daily ration in most individuals corresponded to ca. 50% of its dry weight while some individuals showed the extremes of non-feeding or voracious feeding (>200% (d(-1)), indicating that some of the young Z. nagae had an intermittent feeding mode, which would be adaptive to save energy expenditure at low prey densities and to reduce mortality by lowering the risk of predation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1880-8247			WOS:000461128500006

Among birds, predation is regarded as the primary agent of selection on nest-site microhabitat preferences, but alternatives are rarely considered. We tested the hypothesis that avian nest-site preferences are an adaptive response to fitness costs imposed by variation in nest-site microclimate. We documented that Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarius ornatus) strongly preferred to orient nests towards the southeast and showed that this preference influenced microclimate: nests facing southeast had the highest midday temperatures. Yet, preferences were not adaptive because nestlings in nests with the preferred orientation gained mass at a slower rate, had retarded skeletal growth, and reached a smaller final size. We experimentally tested this result by altering orientation of nests and confirmed, for the first time, that variation in nestling growth was causally linked to variation in nest microclimate arising from nest-orientation preferences. Adults responded to the high temperatures at preferred southeast-facing nests by spending more time shading young from the sun, apparently attempting to ameliorate heat costs. This response, however, resulted in parents spending less time feeding young, potentially explaining slower growth in these nests. Direct effects of higher temperatures may also play a role in slower growth. Although we lack an explanation for this apparently maladaptive preference, these results demonstrate that nest-site choices of birds can yield fitness costs imposed by variation in nest microclimate.									59	1	0	0	57	0	61			1045-2249			WOS:000223042500016		
J	KNEIB, RT								POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF THE TANAID HARGERIA-RAPAX (CRUSTACEA, PERACARIDA) IN A TIDAL MARSH								MARINE BIOLOGY				113	3			437	445		10.1007/BF00349169				JUL 1992	1992	The tanaidacean Hargeria rapax (Harger, 1879) was sampled along intertidal transects semi-monthly at one site and quarterly at two other sites in salt marshes on Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA, from July 1985 to July 1986. Tanaids were most abundant near the mean high-water line and became progressively less abundant at lower intertidal elevations. Population density was greatest in the winter (December to February) when there were > 29 000 individuals/m2 at one high intertidal station. Although reproductive individuals were present most of the year, peaks in reproductive activity occurred in autumn (late August to early November) and spring (early March to mid June). An increase in population density coincided with increased reproductive activity only in autumn. Tanaid cohorts produced in the spring and summer rarely survived beyond 6 to 8 wk, but those produced in the autumn overwintered and lived 22 to 26 wk. The sex ratio among mature individuals was 2.8:1 (females: males). Mature females ranged in size from 2.2 to 3.9 mm total length (TL) and mature males were 2.3 to 4.1 mm TL; there was no significant sexual difference (Student's t-test, P > 0.05) in the mean TL of mature individuals. The mean (+/- SD) size of brooding females was 2.9 +/- 0.32 mm TL and the mean (+/- SD) number of offspring/brood was 8.3 +/- 4.99 young/female. The timing of tanaid reproduction together with the effects of predation by juvenile fish and crustaceans may account for most of the spatial and temporal patterns of tanaid abundance observed in this study. There was a significant linear relationship (P < 0.001, r2 = 0.54) between the growth rate (GR, mm/d) of individuals and average daily air temperature (degrees-C) described by the equation: GR = 0.00178 (degrees-C)-0.00971. The potential annual contribution of tanaid production to higher trophic levels, estimated from knowledge of standing stocks, growth rates and fecundity, was 5.71, 0.91 and 0.46 g dry wt/m2 for high, mid and low intertidal areas, respectively. The high intertidal marsh, which supports the largest and most persistent standing stock of H. rapax, provides a rich foraging area for aquatic predators at high tide and an important source of recruits from which tanaid populations at lower intertidal elevations are recolonized after periods of intense predation pressure.									37	0	0	0	34	4	38			0025-3162			WOS:A1992JJ78700012

Larvae of a flightless moth, weevil larvae and adults and, at one of the sites, earthworms were the invertebrate items that showed the highest importance value over the year. Diet diversity was slightly lower in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. Diet variety was lowest in midsummer and highest in either autumn or winter, depending on the site. Mean stomach-content mass was significantly higher in midwinter than during the rest of the year. When offered prey of different types and sizes, mice selected moth larvae first in 92% of the trials; earthworms or weevil adults were most frequently selected second, and weevil larvae fourth. An introduced slug species was selected only once, as the last choice and only part of it was eaten. With both moth larvae and,earthworms, the heaviest individual offered was almost always chosen first. Surprisingly, mice never consumed more than about half of the seed offered to them and their condition deteriorated severely during the trials with seed; in a third of the trials with two types of seed, the mice completely ignored the seed. The impact of mice predation on invertebrates was assessed at two of the sites - a dry mire and a coastal biotic herbfield that is influenced by seabird and seal manuring. Moth larvae and adults, weevil larvae and adults, earthworms, spiders and flies made up > 90% of the animal remains in the stomach contents over the year and, on average, the mice daily consumed 45 g (dry mass) ha(-1) of those invertebrates at the mire and 194 g ha(-1) at the biotic site. Moth larvae made up a substantial proportion of these amounts; average daily consumption was 30 g ha(-1) at the mire and 107 g ha(-1) at the biotic site. In terms of the amount consumed in relation to biomass, the heaviest impact of mice at both sites was on weevil adults; at the biotic site mice daily consumed 13% of weevil adult biomass in autumn and nearly 6 times the annual average biomass over the year. At the mire, slightly more than the annual average weevil adult biomass was consumed over the year. The consumption of invertebrates by mice found in this study (1992/1993) was about 20% greater than in 1979/1980. The most striking changes in annual average consumption rate between 1979/1980 and 1992/1993 were for weevil larvae (increased nearly fourfold) and earthworms (increased sixfold at the biotic site and threefold at the mire). In contrast, the consumption of spiders at both sites decreased between 1979/1980 and 1992/1993.									69	2	0	0	67	1	74			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000177863700010

Here we describe a number of data collections from arctic Canada that monitor vertebrate population trends of freshwater and marine fish, marine birds, marine and terrestrial mammals. These time series data cover the last ca. 30 years and capture a period from the onset of global changes affecting the Arctic up to recent years with a rapid increase in temperature. While many of these data collections were initiated through a variety of government and university programs, they also include a surge in polar research launched with the recent International Polar Year (2007-2008). We estimated the long-term vertebrate index from our data that summarizes various taxa abundance trends within a global context and observed a continuous decline of about 30 % in population abundance since the 1990s. Though most data collections are biased towards few taxa, we conduct time-series analyses to show that the potential value of long-term data emerges as individual monitoring sites can be spread across space and time scales. Despite covering a handful of populations, the different time series data covered a large spectrum of dynamics, cyclic to non-cyclic, including coherence with the North Atlantic Oscillation, lag effects, and density dependence. We describe a synthesis framework to integrate ecological time-series research and thereby derive additional benefits to management, science, and policy. Future requirements include: (1) continuation of current observation systems; (2) expansion of current monitoring sites to include additional trophic links and taxonomic indicators; (3) expansion beyond the existing program to include greater spatial coverage into less-sampled ecosystems and key representative locations; and (4) integration of circumpolar observations and comprehensive analyses. Development of a circumpolar observation system is necessary for innovative science, large-scale adaptive management, and policy revision essential to respond to rapid global change.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000309866900011

Information about prey capture rates, the strategies that diving predators use to maximise prey encounter rates and foraging success are still largely unknown and difficult to observe. As well, with the growing awareness of potential climate change impacts and the increasing interest in the development of renewable sources it is unknown how the foraging activity of diving predators such as seabirds will respond to both the presence of underwater structures and the potential corresponding changes in prey distributions. Motivated by this issue we developed a theoretical model to gain general understanding of how the foraging efficiency of diving predators may vary according to landscape structure and foraging strategy. Our theoretical model highlights that animal movements, intervals between prey capture and foraging efficiency are likely to critically depend on the distribution of the prey resource and the size and distribution of introduced underwater structures. For multiple prey loaders, changes in prey distribution affected the searching time necessary to catch a set amount of prey which in turn affected the foraging efficiency. The spatial aggregation of prey around small devices (similar to 9 x 9 m) created a valuable habitat for a successful foraging activity resulting in shorter intervals between prey captures and higher foraging efficiency. The presence of large devices (similar to 24 x 24 m) however represented an obstacle for predator movement, thus increasing the intervals between prey captures. In contrast, for single prey loaders the introduction of spatial aggregation of the resources did not represent an advantage suggesting that their foraging efficiency is more strongly affected by other factors such as the timing to find the first prey item which was found to occur faster in the presence of large devices. The development of this theoretical model represents a useful starting point to understand the energetic reasons for a range of potential predator responses to spatial heterogeneity and environmental uncertainties in terms of search behaviour and predator-prey interactions. We highlight future directions that integrated empirical and modelling studies should take to improve our ability to predict how diving predators will be impacted by the deployment of manmade structures in the marine environment.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2167-8359			WOS:000347620600001	25250211

Life tables were calculated to evaluate the biological parameters. The optimal development of A. brasiliensis took place at 29 degrees C. The values of T (time of generation - days), R-0 and r(m) at 30 degrees C were, 13.95, 16.25 and 0.20, respectively. The prey consumption of A. brasiliensis was studied at the densities of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 leprosis mite females per cage (3 cm in diameter) on citrus fruits at 29 degrees C. The maximum prey, namely 7.6 B. phoenicis females per day, were consumed at a density of 20 leprosis mites. At densities of above 40 leprosis mites per cage, A. brasiliensis oviposits 4.7 eggs per day, in comparison to 2.5 eggs per day at 20 mites per cage.									13	0	0	0	13	1	15			1519-566X	1678-8052		WOS:000257754800016	17934624

Especially individuals in northern populations may face severe time constraints in their need of completing development before the end of the growth season. Larval amphibians have been widely used in studies of phenotypic plasticity. However, their responses to changes in photoperiod, the main seasonal cue in many organisms, are unknown. In a laboratory experiment, we studied whether common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles originating from two populations (separated latitudinally by 1600 km) adjust their growth and development according to the progress of the season by using photoperiodic cues, and whether these responses are temperature dependent. We hypothesised that if frogs use photoperiod as a cue, they should increase growth and development rates as a response to photoperiodic treatments mimicking progressing season. Although our predictions were not verified in either of the populations, photoperiod manipulations had effects on larval life history in both populations. When exposed to progressing season treatments and high temperature, tadpoles from the southern population ceased feeding which led to delayed metamorphosis and increased mortality. In the northern population, age at metamorphosis was unaffected by the photoperiod treatments, but growth rate until metamorphosis and metamorphic size were slightly larger in the treatments with shorter (increasing or decreasing) day length. Irrespective of photoperiod treatments, growth and development rates, size at metamorphosis and food consumption were higher in the northern as compared to the southern population. These results indicate that in contrast to several insect species, the critical life history decisions in amphibian larvae may not be strongly influenced by photoperiodic cues, but different populations seem to differ in this respect. However, the strong temperature x photoperiod interactions in several traits in the southern population suggest that the role of photoperiodic cues may be affected by other environmental factors, although the ecological significance of these differences remains unclear.									41	0	0	0	43	0	43			0030-1299			WOS:000173729000010		
J	Ling, Hong; Fu, Shi-Jian; Zeng, Ling-Qing								Predator stress decreases standard metabolic rate and growth in juvenile crucian carp under changing food availability								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY				231				149	157		10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.02.016				MAY 2019	2019	Animals adapt to the challenges of fluctuations in predator risk and food availability in their natural habitats. Phenotypic plasticity allows animals to handle environmental changes. However, the patterns of flexibility in metabolic rates and its ecological consequences under different predator stress and food availability conditions are poorly understood. Here, we used crucial carp (Carassius auratus) as a prey species and northern snakehead (Channa argus) as a predator to test whether predator stress influences metabolism and growth, and alters the link between flexibility in metabolic rate and its ecological consequences (e.g., growth) in crucial carp. The experiment was carried out under the conditions of predator stress (with or without a predator) and three food availabilities (satiation feeding 1 time per day, low food availability; 2 times per day, intermediate food availability; and 3 times per day, high food availability) for 3 weeks. After 21 days of feeding, the final body mass and body length in the two treatments increased compared to the initial values in all three food availabilities. The feeding intake (FI) and specific growth rate (SGR) of the two treatments increased with increasing food availability. The control treatment had a higher FI and SGR than the predator stress treatment in all three food availabilities. The feeding efficiency (FE) of the two treatments was higher at the high and intermediate food availabilities than at the low food availability. However, no effect of predator stress on FE was detected. The final values of original or standardized SMR were higher in the control treatment than the predator stress treatment at the intermediate and high food availabilities. The changes in SMR (Delta SMR) were higher in the control treatment than in the predator stress treatment. The positive correlation between the Delta SMR and SGR was found in the intermediate food availability in the predator stress treatment, suggesting that individuals with a higher flexibility in SMR had a larger growth rate and vice versa, but this relationship was dependent on food availability. Our results suggest that predator stress decreased maintenance metabolism, feeding and growth of juvenile crucial carp irrespective of food availability. Predator stress does not alter the growth advantages conferred by the metabolic plasticity of the fish under changing food availability.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1095-6433	1531-4332		WOS:000463312300018	30802626

Effect's of initial aphid density, temperature and a predator on the population dynamics of A. gossypii under controlled laboratory conditions were studied. The three factors had major and interacting effects on most population parameters measured. Temperature and the initial density of aphids were key drivers of population dynamics with predation playing a role, except at the lowest temperature of 18 degrees C. The most suitable condition for the total aphid population size was the temperature of 24 degrees C. The population size declined at higher temperatures (27-30 degrees C). Obtained results suggest that if aphids experience temperatures around 24 degrees C for several weeks during the cotton-growing season, an outbreak is possible. Monitoring of aphids early in the cotton-growing season, maintaining natural predators and accurate weather forecasts are important tools for management of A. gossypii.									2	1	0	0	2	0	3			1110-1768			WOS:000368323300019

Here, we tested experimentally how soil food web trophic complexity modulates the response to drought of soil functions related to carbon cycling and the capture and transfer below-ground of recent photosynthate by plants. We constructed experimental systems comprising soil communities with one, two or three trophic levels (microorganisms, detritivores and predators) and subjected them to drought. We investigated how food web trophic complexity in interaction with drought influenced litter decomposition, soil CO2 efflux, mycorrhizal colonization, fungal production, microbial communities and soil fauna biomass. Plants were pulse-labelled after the drought with C-13-CO2 to quantify the capture of recent photosynthate and its transfer below-ground. Overall, our results show that drought and soil food web trophic complexity do not interact to affect soil functions and microbial community composition, but act independently, with an overall stronger effect of drought. After drought, the net uptake of C-13 by plants was reduced and its retention in plant biomass was greater, leading to a strong decrease in carbon transfer below-ground. Although food web trophic complexity influenced the biomass of Collembola and fungal hyphal length, C-13 enrichment and the net transfer of carbon from plant shoots to microbes and soil CO2 efflux were not affected significantly by varying the number of trophic groups. Our results indicate that drought has a strong effect on above-ground-below-ground linkages by reducing the flow of recent photosynthate. Our results emphasize the sensitivity of the critical pathway of recent photosynthate transfer from plants to soil organisms to a drought perturbation, and show that these effects may not be mitigated by the trophic complexity of soil communities, at least at the level manipulated in this experiment.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000480863200001	31301198

We test this idea in a vineyard in south eastern Australia, where reduced water availability because of drought coupled with increased temperatures has generated interest in sustainable alternatives to the exotic perennial cover crops commonly planted. Three endemic perennial cover crops, comprising the grasses Austrodanthonia richardsonii and Chloris truncata and a mix of two saltbushes (Atriplex semi baccata and Atriplex suberecta) were established as cover crops and compared with introduced oats (Avena sativa). Abundance of a range of predators and parasitoids was higher in vines with native cover crops compared with the oat control. In addition, predation levels of sentinel eggs of a common vineyard pest, light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), were increased in the native cover crops. However, the native cover crops also increased the abundance of some potential pest species. Native plants therefore have potential to increase abundance of beneficial invertebrates that assist in pest control, but need to be used carefully to ensure that they do not increase local pest problems.									45	0	0	0	42	1	46			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000278319100027	20550812

The rate and ratio at which protein and carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38 degrees C as at 32 degrees C; however, at the higher temperature, they ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32 degrees C, and protein at 38 degrees C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T. triandra selected 32 degrees C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38 degrees C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted, locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding host-plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal-plant interactions.									53	1	0	0	51	1	53			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000319117400025	23430995

Pumpkinseed populations exhibit more 'opportunistic' traits (earlier maturity, smaller size at maturity, and higher reproductive allocation) in their introduced European range than those in their native range. Predictions of life-history traits were improved when indicators of juvenile growth rate (mean length at age 2), waterbody size (surface area), and thermal regime (air temperature degree-days above 10 A degrees C) were incorporated into models along with continental location, but European pumpkinseed populations exhibit more opportunistic life-history traits than North American populations even when these factors are accounted for. Native pumpkinseed in waterbodies containing piscivores mature later and at a larger size, and have lower gonadosomatic indices than those in waterbodies lacking piscivores, whereas there is no significant difference in the same three life-history traits between European waterbodies containing or lacking piscivores. Because congeneric competitors of the pumpkinseed are absent from Europe, the apparent absence of a predator life-history effect there could also be due to the absence of the major sunfish competitors. In either case, the evolution and maintenance of more opportunistic traits in European pumpkinseed can likely be attributed to enemy release, and this may explain the successful establishment and spread of pumpkinseed in many parts of Europe.									30	0	0	0	29	0	30			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000330734100011	24065557

Because this predator is known to accumulate its Cd mainly from food rather than from water, we presented the Cd in food, that is, Cd-rich copepods taken from a lake near a metal smelter. Rates of Cd accumulation by larvae of Chaoborus americanus, C flavicans, and C. punctipennis were measured at three temperatures (5, 14, and 22degreesC) covering the seasonal range encountered by these animals. The rates at which all species accumulated Cd increased with temperature. To explain these results, we fit our experimental data to a bioaccumulation model that allowed us to estimate Cd assimilation efficiency, Cd-efflux rate, and larval growth rate. Temperature-related changes in Cd accumulation rates were best explained by changes in the rate at which Chaoborus larvae ingested prey as well as the efficiency with which they assimilated Cd from their food. Neither the rate of larval growth nor the rate at which larvae lost Cd was influenced by temperature. Extrapolations of our laboratory results to the field suggest that our model results provide a realistic representation of the processes involved in Cd accumulation by larvae of this common aquatic insect.									28	0	0	0	24	0	28			0024-3590			WOS:000174751100015

Some species settled into the area, but failed to persist to the first winter, while others were present in high numbers throughout the year. The duration of settlement was species-specific, ranging from several weeks to several months. Body size at settlement decreased with increasing temperature during larval development. Growth potential and early mortality of a number of decapod species was examined by separation of successive moult instars from length-frequency distributions. Seasonal lows in abundance and biomass of young of the year and for previously established decapod individuals were identified at the end of July and early August, which may represent the most suitable time to release juveniles for stock-enhancement purposes. Community structure differed between settlement season and over-wintering periods. Young-of-the-year community structure differed from that of previously established individuals, with higher abundance and number of species recorded for the former. The data represent a baseline study of a widely distributed community and may support further work on species interactions, improving the accuracy of prediction of annual recruitment fluctuations.									5	0	0	0	6	0	6			0171-8630			WOS:000165693700016

However, with the recent adoption of more explorative tools, like Bayesian networks, in predictive ecology, few assumptions can be made about the data and complex, spatially varying interactions can be recovered from collected field data. In this study, we compare Bayesian network modelling approaches accounting for latent effects to reveal species dynamics for 7 geographically and temporally varied areas within the North Sea. We also apply structure learning techniques to identify functional relationships such as prey predator between trophic groups of species that vary across space and time. We examine if the use of a general hidden variable can reflect overall changes in the trophic dynamics of each spatial system and whether the inclusion of a specific hidden variable can model unmeasured group of species. The general hidden variable appears to capture changes in the variance of different groups of species biomass. Models that include both general and specific hidden variables resulted in identifying similarity with the underlying food web dynamics and modelling spatial unmeasured effect. We predict the biomass of the trophic groups and find that predictive accuracy varies with the models' features and across the different spatial areas thus proposing a model that allows for spatial autocorrelation and two hidden variables. Our proposed model was able to produce novel insights on this ecosystem's dynamics and ecological interactions mainly because we account for the heterogeneous nature of the driving factors within each area and their changes overtime. Our findings demonstrate that accounting for additional sources of variation, by combining structure learning from data and experts' knowledge in the model architecture, has the potential for gaining deeper insights into the structure and stability of ecosystems. Finally, we were able to discover meaningful functional networks that were spatially and temporally differentiated with the particular mechanisms varying from trophic associations through interactions with climate and commercial fisheries.

Productive regions encompass only a small fraction of the global ocean area yet they contribute disproportionately to marine resources and biogeo-chemical processes, such as fish catch and coastal hypoxia. These regions and/or the full observed range of chlorophyll concentration, however, are often poorly represented in global earth system models (ESMs) used to project climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. Furthermore, recent high resolution (similar to 10 km) global earth system simulations suggest that this shortfall is not solely due to coarse resolution (similar to 100 km) of most global ESMs. By integrating a global biogeochemical model that includes two phytoplankton size classes (typical of many ESMs) into a regional simulation of the California Current System (CCS) we test the hypothesis that a combination of higher spatial resolution and enhanced resolution of phytoplankton size classes and grazer linkages may enable global ESMs to better capture the full range of observed chlorophyll. The CCS is notable for encompassing both oligotrophic (< 0.1 mg m(-3)) and productive (> 10 mg m(-3)) endpoints of the global chlorophyll distribution. As was the case for global high-resolution simulations, the regional high-resolution implementation with two size classes fails to capture the productive endpoint. The addition of a third phytoplankton size class representing a chain-forming coastal diatom enables such models to capture the full range of chlorophyll concentration along a nutrient supply gradient, from highly productive coastal upwelling systems to oligotrophic gyres. Weaker 'top-down' control on coastal diatoms results in stronger trophic decoupling and increased phytoplankton biomass, following the introduction of new nutrients to the photic zone. The enhanced representation of near-shore chlorophyll maxima allows the model to better capture coastal hypoxia along the continental shelf of the North American west coast and may improve the representation of living marine resources.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0079-6611			WOS:000452943300019

BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE				89	1			57	81		10.5343/bms.2011.1137				JAN 2013	2013	Fluctuations in abundance of commercially valuable crustacean stocks in sub-Arctic ecosystems have been variously attributed to the effects of climatic forcing, fishing pressure, and predation, mostly by gadoid fishes. Landings of snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio (J. C. Fabricius, 1788), from the eastern Bering Sea declined after the early 1990s, reaching historical lows a decade later. At the same time, two phenomena became apparent in the dynamics of the primiparae (first-time female breeders): their geographic range contracted to the northwest along the middle shelf (50-100 m depth), and the contraction was punctuated by periodic recruitment to the mature female pool, with a period of approximately 7 yrs and declining amplitude. The first phenomenon has been addressed by the environmental ratchet hypothesis, which attributes the contraction to a combination of an ontogenetic female migration, circulation patterns, the spatial dynamics of benthic stages in relation to near-bottom temperature, and predation by Pacific sod, Gadus macrocephalus Tilesius, 1810. Mortality due to cod predation in the Middle Domain, apparently related to near-bottom temperature, increased after 1995, contributing to the ratchet effect and the disappearance of periodic pulses of primipara abundance. Cod predation does not, however, appear to have controlled the frequency of periodic recruitment fluctuations. On the other hand, amplitude of fluctuations of primipara abundance in the Middle Domain, purportedly the "engine" of renewal of this stock, do appear to be affected by both predation and climate, whose interaction is complex but perhaps interpretable.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0007-4977	1553-6955		WOS:000325306300005

David; Fisher, Mark								Does proximity to freshwater refuge affect the size structure of an estuarine predator (Carcharhinus leucas) in the north-western Gulf of Mexico?								MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				71	11			1501	1516		10.1071/MF19346				2020	2020	The life histories of estuarine species are often adapted to the environmental variability they experience. However, estuaries are increasingly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic changes, necessitating an understanding of how shifting conditions affect the survival, behaviour and population structure of estuarine-dependent animals. In this study we used data from fisheries-independent surveys collected across six estuaries with variable salinity regimes in Texas, USA, from 1975 to 2016 to investigate the role sources of freshwater inflow play in shaping juvenile bull shark Carcharhinus leucas size structure. High frequencies of co-occurrence with similarly sized conspecifics (59% of capture events) suggest bull sharks segregated within Texan estuaries based on body size. Bull shark sizes increased with distance to the nearest source of freshwater inflow, although effect sizes were small and access to freshwater habitats may be more important in shaping size-dependent distribution patterns. River mouths were disproportionately used by smaller juveniles (<90-cm total length, TL) and avoided by larger juveniles (>135 cm TL). However, the use of river mouths decreased in estuaries characterised by limited freshwater inflow and greater variability in salinities at river mouths, highlighting geographic differences in the functions these habitats provide as potential environmental and predator refugia. Young-of-the-year (i.e. age-0) sharks also increased their use of river mouths throughout the 40-year study period, revealing the growing importance of river mouths as potential nursery habitats.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000582546200006

The otoliths of the fish were marked 1 to 3 d prior to release with an alizarin complexone fluorescent marker. The size at release of flounder recaptured by a beam trawl, set net and commercial catch was estimated using the fluorescent mark diameter to TL relationship, and survival and growth rates were examined. As time progressed after release, back-calculated release size distributions gradually shifted to larger values. The flounder fry > 9 cm at release were successful in recruiting to commercial fisheries. The major cause of mortality was thought to be predation by large flounder and greenling Hexagrammos otakii which were abundant in the flounder nursery ground. Growth rate of released flounder was high in the warm and low in the cold season. Individual growth rates were estimated by otolith mark diameter and TL at catch. The relationship of release size and growth rate analyzed in the flounder recaptured 11 mo after release indicated that survival of released flounder is strongly associated with size itself and growth rate in the field.									64	3	0	0	63	0	70			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1994NA72100006

The study period, 14 January to 11 February 1994, coincided with the growth and decline of a diatom-dominated phytoplankton bloom. Nine taxa of heterotrophic dinoflagellates, including 2 naked and 7 armoured forms, were identified and selected for the determination of standing stock and grazing rates. All 9 taxa selected for grazing rate measurements showed an increase in abundance and biomass during the phytoplankton bloom. Total abundance and biomass increased exponentially from 14 January to reach a maximum abundance, when the 9 taxa were combined, of 46 400 cells l(-1) on the 31 January, equivalent to a standing stock of 114.5 mu g C l(-1). Taxon-specific grazing rates were determined at in situ predator and prey concentrations by tracing C-14 through a 3 compartment (water, phytoplankton, heterotrophic dinoflagellate) model. Mean taxon-specific clearance rates varied more than 10-fold from 0.028 mu l cell(-1) h(-1) in Diplopeltopsis spp, to 0.318 mu l cell(-1) h(-1) in a Protoperidinium sp. In contrast, mean taxon-specific rates of ingestion varied only 3-fold from 0.72 pg chl a cell(-1) h(-1) in Diplopeltopsis spp. to 2.38 pg chl a cell(-1) h(-1) in the same Protoperidinium sp. The total ingestion rate of the 9 taxa was 29.7 ng chl a l(-1) h(-1) on 31 January, of which 92 % was consumed by the 3 most abundant taxa, Gyrodinium sp.1, Gyrodinium sp.2 and Diplopeltopsis spp. This activity represented 6.7 % of the water column cleared, 4.8 % of autotrophic biomass and 25 % of daily primary production ingested per day. The estimated rates of specific ingestion and growth of heterotrophic dinoflagellates were lower in the coastal waters of East Antarctica than in laboratory studies carried out at higher temperatures. However, when the environmental parameters, predator size and prey type and concentration are taken into account, values measured in the present study are tenable, comparing well with other in situ measurements. Furthermore, the estimates of grazing impact on phytoplankton biomass and production illustrate that heterotrophic dinoflagellates play an important part in the biotic control of phytoplankton production and therefore of carbon flux through the food web of coastal waters of East Antarctica.									70	9	0	0	55	0	77			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1996VG03400020

The developmental threshold and effective accumulative temperature from egg to pupa for M. angulatus were 9.6℃ and 270.3 day-degrees,respectively. The developmental period of egg, larva, and pupa at 25℃ was 4.4, 5.5, and 6.9 days. respectively. The longevity of an adult female M. angulatus was 34.9 days. The oviposition period for M. angulatus was 28.7 days, in which it laid a total number of 515.2 eggs during its life span. The maximum number of eggs laid by a female in a day was 54.8. Daily consumption by M. angulatus at 25℃was 18.9 1st instars, 47.2 2nd instars, 57.7 3rd instars, and 91.0 adults of the glasshouse potato aphid, Aulacorthum solani. Therefore, M. angulatus could be a promising biological control agent against aphids.				본 연구는 온도(15, 20, 25, 30℃), 습도(70 ± 10%), 광주기(16L:8D)에서 갈고리뱀잠자리붙이의 생물적 특성을 조사하기 위해 수행되었다. 알에서부터 번데기까지의 발육영점온도 및 유효적산온도는 각각 9.6℃ 및 270.3일도였다. 25℃에서 갈고리뱀잠자리붙이의 알 기간은 4.4일,유충은 5.5일, 번데기는 6.9일이었다. 암컷 성충의 수명은 34.9일, 산란 기간은 28.7일이었고, 총 산란수는 515.2개, 1일 최대 산란수는 54.8개였다. 25℃에서 갈고리뱀잠자리붙이에 의한 싸리수염진딧물의 1령, 2령, 3령 및 성충의 일일 포식량은 각각 18.9, 47.2, 57.7 및 91.0마리이었다.따라서 갈고리뱀잠자리붙이는 진딧물의 포식성 천적으로 이용이 가능할 것으로 여겨진다.					1	0	0	0	2	0	2			1225-0171			KJD:ART001822666

Both species feed on zooplankton, raising the potential for competition between them. While jellyfish are tactile filtering planktivores, sticklebacks are visual feeders that actively detect, attack and capture prey. The study compared clearance rates (Cl) and tested the hypothesis that jellyfish are more efficient in feeding on small prey and sticklebacks on larger prey animals. Individual (Cl-ind) and population (Cl-pop) feeding characteristics were studied under good visual conditions. Individual sticklebacks (TL = 44 mm) demonstrated 14-51-fold higher Cl-ind than jellyfish (d = 27 mm) when feeding on small (<1 mm) and medium (1-4 mm) sized prey and threefold higher Cl-ind when feeding on larger prey (4-11 mm) Cl-pop was calculated for both species based on their densities in the cove. When consuming small- and medium-sized prey in May-July, Cl-pop for stickleback was 2-20-fold higher than for jellyfish, but in August following a decrease in fish density, Cl-pop was higher for jellyfish. This may imply higher predation pressure from stickleback on zooplankton in Kertinge Nor at the beginning of the season, though the common jellyfish was considered earlier as a species controlling zooplankton there. The two competing species likely coexist in the cove due to different seasonal cycles of abundance and thus different seasonal patterns of plankton consumption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000442700800001

J	Watt, Cortney; Garbary, David J.; Longtin, Caroline					Garbary, David/0000-0001-5126-6608			Population structure of the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa in salt marshes in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada								HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH				65	3			275	283		10.1007/s10152-010-0221-4				SEP 2011	2011	The ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, is highly dependent on the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora for amelioration from environmental stress and substrate stabilization. Spartina alterniflora is a foundation species in marshes, and G. demissa is typically associated with cordgrass beds. Marshes in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence are experiencing erosion and degradation, presumably as a result of increases in sea level, which increases salinity exposure and negatively impacts S. alterniflora. The population structure of the ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, was studied at nine sites in six estuaries in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence in Nova Scotia, Canada, where marsh degradation is occurring. Mussel length was used as a proxy for age of G. demissa in three salt marsh zones characterized by density and elevation of Spartina alterniflora: (1) a lower zone in which the S. alterniflora was dead, but where the basal mat was coherent, (2) a zone of living, but low density S. alterniflora at the margin of the living marsh, and (3) a zone of dense S. alterniflora one to three meters back from the edge. Mussel length was significantly different across the three zones in seven of the nine sites. Mean length decreased as elevation increased, and small mussels (i.e., 1-3 cm) were absent at seven sites. The smallest mussels occurred in the dense S. alterniflora zone, higher in the marsh. Mussel length in the two western sites did not differ between zones, and small mussels (i.e., 1-3 cm) were present, but rare. The absence of small mussels in seven of the nine sites, and the size frequency distribution at remaining sites, suggests a lack of recent recruitment and a long-term threat to the survival of G. demissa. Salt marsh degradation and the death of S. alterniflora have negatively impacted G. demissa recruitment, and population decline is evident.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			1438-387X	1438-3888		WOS:000293980700002

Distribution and feeding of chaetognaths in the epipelagic zone of the Lazarev Sea (Antarctica) during austral summer								POLAR BIOLOGY				35	5			689	703		10.1007/s00300-011-1114-y				MAY 2012	2012	This study seeks to determine the effects of local hydrography on the distribution, abundance and feeding of chaetognaths in the Lazarev Sea, an area strongly controlled by physical processes which has been held responsible for initiating the Weddell Polynya. Zooplankton samples were taken at 39 stations on four transects located between 6A degrees W and 3A degrees E and from 60A degrees S to 70A degrees S between surface and 350 m. The dominant species, Eukrohnia hamata, accounted for 86.5% of all chaetognaths, followed by Sagitta gazellae (8.1%) and Sagitta marri (5.4%). These three species showed distinct vertical and horizontal distribution patterns. While E. hamata and S. marri had maximum abundances below 250 m depth, S. gazellae showed a narrow distribution band in the upper 150 m depth. The distribution pattern was strongly modified at the Greenwich meridian with an upward transport of a high abundance of deep dwelling organisms (S. marri and E. hamata) and a displacement of S. gazellae to the surface, likely coupled with the rise of the warm, saline halo around the Maud Rise. Small copepods were the main prey of all three chaetognath species. Feeding rates (FR) varied among species and depth. Sagitta marri showed the highest FR with 0.38 prey d(-1), followed by S. gazellae and E. hamata (0.22 and 0.07 prey d(-1)). Feeding rates were usually highest in the 25-80-m stratum. Size distribution and maturity of E. hamata revealed a dominance of small and immature organisms along all depths and stations, suggesting that this area might be acting as an important source of recently spawned organisms to the surface.									6	2	0	0	5	0	8			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000302480600005

Differences in life history strategies can lead to different responses to the same environmental conditions even among closely related species. Investigating the factors affecting the timing of reproduction in closely related and sympatric species may help understanding the relationship between different life history traits and species-specific responses to ecological factors. We investigated the effects of season (photoperiod), local climatic variability and prey abundance on the breeding season of two sympatric insectivorous birds that differ in the timing of reproduction and moult and have different migration strategies: the Moustached Warbler Acrocephalus melanopogon and the Eurasian Reed-warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. During a five-year period, breeding phenology was determined by examining bird incubation patches during standardised captures and food availability was assessed by invertebrate sampling. Time, mean temperatures and the abundance of some prey taxa were inter-correlated and all contributed to influence the breeding phenology of both species according to partial least squares regression analysis. Besides some interspecific differences in the effect of environmental factors on the breeding phenology, we found strong similarities between the patterns observed in the two warblers. This suggests that, in spite of interspecific differences in life history, the ecological mechanisms shaping reproduction phenology are similar in the two warblers and the same environmental factors are involved in determining the timing of their reproduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0570-7358	2341-0825		WOS:000546028800010		
J	CASTRO, LR; COWEN, RK								ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS AFFECTING THE EARLY LIFE-HISTORY OF BAY ANCHOVY ANCHOA-MITCHILLI IN GREAT SOUTH BAY, NEW-YORK								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				76	3			235	247		10.3354/meps076235				OCT 1991	1991	For bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, 3 life-history parameters were studied in Great South Bay during late spring and summer of 1987 and 1988: intensity of spawning, larval growth rates, and egg and larval mortality rates. Duration of peak spawning season was highly correlated (p < 0.01) with larval food abundance in the field (copepod nauplii + copepodite and adult cyclopoids + copepodite calanoids), but not correlated with salinity or temperature. Cohort mortality rates determined throughout the spawning season were lower in the middle of the peak spawning season (when food availability was maximum) and higher at the begining and end of the spawning season. Since the duration of the high microzooplankton abundance is so short (4 to 5 wk) and because of the high energy requirements of young bay anchovy, it is proposed that adult bay anchovy spawn during the season of maximum food availability thus enhancing offspring survival. When the effects of the type of habitat were analyzed on a local scale, no difference was found between eelgrass and unvegetated areas in: (1) egg or larval density, (2) larval growth rates, (3) egg and yolk sac larvae mortalities. Mortality rates of older larvae (> 3 d old), however, were higher in eelgrass beds than in unvegetated areas. Since microzooplankton abundances were not different among stations, increased mortality rates in the vegetated areas seem to result from higher levels of predation. This suggests that the hypothesis that vegetated areas are used as preferential zones for spawning and nursing may not be aplicable to bay anchovy. When the 3 population parameters studied are considered on a latitudinal basis, it was found that (1) duration of spawning season in Great South Bay is among the shortest reported in the literature, and decreased with increasing latitude; (2) average mortality rates were similar to those reported for populations located at other areas; (3) average larval growth rates tended to be higher in Great South Bay in spite of the lower temperatures during the spawning season. Possible interrelationships among these trends in life-history traits are discussed, and future lines of research on population differentiation are proposed.									52	0	0	0	47	1	53			0171-8630			WOS:A1991GM74500003

Eight reproductive variables assessed during the period of January-May, grouped in two factors, were related to commercial catches in the surrounding 6600 km2 area during the following June-December. The first factor explained 33% of interannual variance in fish captures per unit effort during June-December (future FCUE), and 63% when only El Nino years were considered. Also, the proportion of large clutches present on three single-day censuses in the spring explained 51, 46 and 35% of variance in future FCUE among all years, and 78, 85 and 82% of variance among El Nino years. In contrast, sea surface temperatures in March did not explain variance in future FCUE. Proportion of large clutches is a moderately good predictor of the abundance of commercial fish during the subsequent seven months and can be satisfactorily and cheaply measured on a single day.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000323635600022

Numbers of APP were evaluated from their autofluorescence. DAPI staining and the Fluorescently Labeled Bacteria technique were employed to count ciliates and estimate their feeding rates. A total of 38 taxa of ciliates have been identified using Quantitative Protargol Staining. Peritrichs followed by minute spirotrichs (particularly Halteria grandinella) often numerically dominated the ciliate assemblage and emerged as the most efficient APP feeders. A maximum of 54 ciliate cells ml(-1) was observed in the surface layer at the end of the mixing period, during the development of diatoms (Cyclotella alchichicana), the cyanobacterial bloom (Nodularia sp.) and its decay. Vorticellids (Pelagovorticella natans, Vorticella sp.) had the highest APP uptake (median 130 APP cil(-1) h(-1)). Mixotrophic Euplotes cf. daidaleos were important APP grazers near the oxycline. Scuticociliates (Cyclidium glaucoma, Uronema nigricans and an anaerobic cf. Isocyclidium globossum), were numerically dominant within the hypolimnetic assemblages and did not ingest APP. Generally, APP were not an important food source for the majority of the ciliate assemblage, being positively selected by a few species during the APP decay in aerobic and microaerobic conditions.

The fish were fed to satiation and subsequently the stomach contents were sampled to determine the rate at which food was evacuated. Satiation meal size was positively related to temperature and differed between prey types. The gastric evacuation rate (GER) also tended to increase with temperature and varied with prey type. GER at temperatures of 11.3-12.7 degrees C averaged 1.5-1.7 times higher than at 6-9.5 degrees C. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the evacuation of lugworm Arenicola marina, sandeel Ammodytes spp., and herring Chipea harengus, but the GER of brown shrimp Crangon vulgaris was much slower (P<0.05). No significant changes in GER were observed when fish were fed on three different size groups of either herring or brown shrimp.

We determined GERs and CMAXs of rainbow trout (approx. 160-300 mm TL, 40-300 g live weight), fed chironomid larvae at 7.8, 10.0 and 12.8 degrees C. Primary GER and CMAX results are provided so they can be readily compared and combined with data from related studies. Disclosure of primary data should facilitate development of predictive equations for GER and CMAX that are applicable to the broad array of conditions under which rainbow trout exist. Our GERs at 10 degrees C were intermediate to but different from most reported in other such studies of rainbow trout at this temperature where different food types were used. Our CMAX values for rainbow trout were substantially higher than those reported in a previous study, and we argue that our values are probably more appropriate for streamdwelling populations. We also provide evidence that Elliott's (1972, 1975) equations for predicting GER and CMAX in brown trout, Salmo trutta, should not be applied to rainbow trout as has been done in some studies.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000072605800009

Much has been learned through study of the communities developing around invading herbivorous insects. Much less, however, is known about the significance of such aliens for native vertebrate predators for which invaders may represent a novel food source. We quantified spatial patterns in native bird predation of invading gall-inducing Andricus wasps associated with introduced Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) at eight sites across the UK. These gallwasps are available at high density before the emergence of caterpillars that are the principle spring food of native insectivorous birds. Native birds showed positive spatial density dependence in gall attack rates at two sites in southern England, foraging most extensively on trees with highest gall densities. In a subsequent study at one of these sites, positive spatial density dependence persisted through four of five sequential week-long periods of data collection. Both patterns imply that invading galls are a significant resource for at least some native bird populations. Density dependence was strongest in southern UK bird populations that have had longest exposure to the invading gallwasps. We hypothesise that this pattern results from the time taken for native bird populations to learn how to exploit this novel resource.									6	0	0	0	6	1	6			1932-6203			WOS:000314759400106	23342048

Across two distinct seasonal plankton assemblages, microzooplankton dominated both phytoplankton and bacteria grazing and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization. Mass-specific ingestion rates by microzooplankton were,20 times higher than ingestion rates of crustaceans. Although most carbon ingested by microzooplankton was in the form of bacteria, microzooplankton inflicted substantially higher mortalities (both in absolute terms and relative to maximum potential growth rates) on both phytoplankton and bacteria compared with crustaceans. Mass-specific P and N excretion rates were also higher (by 70 and 50 times, respectively) than crustacean excretion rates. These results suggest that microzooplankton grazing and nutrient mineralization are driving forces affecting bacteria and phytoplankton dynamics, playing important roles in carbon and nutrient transfer to upper trophic levels even in pelagic freshwater systems containing abundant crustaceans.									36	0	0	0	32	0	36			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000246690000010

Non-lethal effect of the invasive predator Bythotrephes longimanus on Daphnia mendotae								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				51	6			1070	1078		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01555.x				JUN 2006	2006	1. We evaluated the antipredator behaviour of Daphnia mendotae to the invasive invertebrate predator, Bythotrephes longimanus, and the consequent effect of the predator on prey growth rate (referred to as a non-lethal effect of the predator).2. In a laboratory experiment, Daphnia in the absence of Bythotrephes kairomones remained in the top, warmer regions of experimental columns, whereas in the presence of Bythotrephes kairomones, Daphnia migrated vertically, occupying a middle region by night and a low, cold region during the day. Over a 4-day experiment, the vertical migration induced by Bythotrephes caused a 36% reduction in the somatic growth rate of Daphnia, a level that is sufficient to have an effect on prey population growth rate.3. A second laboratory experiment indicated that concentrations of Bythotrephes kairomones in water taken directly from the field (Lake Michigan) were high enough to induce behavioural shifts that led to these large reductions in somatic growth rate.4. Our results identify a means by which Bythotrephes has substantial effects on native prey populations other than through direct consumption.									68	1	0	0	65	0	68			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000237692800007

In Kansas, USA, optimal sites for wind energy development often overlap with preferred habitats of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), a lek-mating prairie grouse of conservation concern. We tested for potential effects of energy development on male Greater Prairie-Chickens in north-central Kansas. We captured males at 23 leks located 0.04 to 28 km from wind turbines during a 2-yr preconstruction period (2007-2008) and a 3-yr postconstruction period (2009-2011). First, we tested for effects of proximity to turbines, habitat, and lek size on annual probability of lek persistence and changes in male numbers. We predicted that energy development might result in behavioral avoidance of areas close to turbines, resulting in increased rates of lek abandonment and fewer males attending surviving leks. We found that distance to turbine had a negative effect on lek persistence for leks,8 km from turbines during the postconstruction period, supporting the 8-km buffer zone recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an offset for wind energy projects. Additionally, lek persistence was positively related to number of males counted at a lek and with grassland cover surrounding the lek. Second, we tested for effects of wind energy development on male body mass. We predicted that degraded habitat conditions might result in decreased body mass for males attending leks near turbines during the postconstruction period. Male body mass was similar to 2% lower during the postconstruction period, but distance to turbine did not affect body mass. Additional study is needed to determine whether short-term effects of turbines on lek persistence influence population viability of Greater Prairie-Chickens.									36	0	0	0	30	0	36			0010-5422	1938-5129		WOS:000355315500013

In rivers, allochthonous inputs of particulate organic matter may mitigate food limitation effects allowing density-independent mechanisms associated with washout (discharge) and feeding interference (turbidity) to assume greater importance. We experimentally manipulated densities of commonly occurring riverine zooplankton (Bosmina longirostris and cyclopoid copepods) within 20001 mesocosms containing ambient or algal-enriched food resources. The experiment was repeated through time (July, August, September) to represent the range of zooplankton densities and food resource levels observed in the Ohio River during warm-water, low-flow conditions. High growth rates and low sensitivity to density-dependent effects were observed during July when particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll concentrations were highest. Lower growth rates and stronger response to density-dependent effects were observed during August and September experiments when POC and chlorophyll concentrations were lower. Direct manipulations of algal abundance resulted in higher growth rates when gains in chlorophyll were accompanied by increases in the edible size fraction (September experiment). Algal C concentrations were found to be a significant predictor of variation in population growth rates for Bosmina but not cyclopoids. Algal C concentrations in the Ohio River rarely fell below experimentally derived minimum food thresholds but were often below saturation thresholds suggesting that population growth rates were constrained by autochthonous food resources despite the prevalence of allochthonous carbon.

To better understand short-term variation in diet, we examined inter-annual variation in body condition indices, fatty acid composition, and stable isotope ratios in EBS beluga whales in relation to environmental conditions. We also examined if differences in dietary tracers in beluga whales reflect sex-and size-based habitat selection. During a warm year anomaly (2012), belugas demonstrated greater overlap in dietary tracers among sex and size classes, whereas greater differences occurred during years with greater sea ice extent over the Mackenzie Shelf (2013 and 2014). Body condition indices (maximum girth and blubber thickness) were highest in belugas in 2011 and 2012 and lowest in 2014. Total Calanus markers 20: 1n-9 and 22: 1n-11 contributed the most to annual variability and had the lowest proportions in females and small males in 2014, a year that coincided with low Arctic cod Boreogadus saida biomass. Age and year were the strongest predictors of fatty acid composition and delta C-13 values in beluga whales, whereas length influenced delta N-15 values, possibly a reflection of larger whales diving to greater depths to feed on Arctic cod. Annual variability in sea ice conditions and prey availability may be associated with inter-annual variation in dietary tracers and condition in beluga whales. As Arctic marine ecosystems are currently undergoing rapid change, understanding the factors causing interannual variation in diet should be a conservation priority for this beluga whale population.									9	0	0	0	7	0	10			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000419090800015

The seasonal occurrence of common green lacewings was monitored in pistachio orchards from 2007 to 2008. In addition, the effect of different temperature regimes on preimaginal development, survival and prey consumption of the predatory lacewing Chrysoperla lucasina fed on A. pistaciae nymphs were studied under controlled conditions. The adults of common green lacewings first appeared on pistachio trees in mid April and were most abundant in early July, decreased in abundance in summer and increased again in October. The relative density of common green lacewings was higher in pistachio orchards where the ground was covered with herbaceous weeds than in those without weeds. In the laboratory females of C. lucasina laid an average of 1085 eggs over 60 days at 22.5 degrees C. The maximum prey consumption occurred at 35 degrees C when the larvae consumed 1812 fourth instar psyllid nymphs during their larval period. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was 0.11. The total development (egg-adult) required 385 degree-days above the theoretical lower developmental threshold of 9.6 degrees C.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7				1802-8829		WOS:000285980200008

Since such an effect could be prey density dependent, a constant density of prey must be maintained while assessing this effect, irrespective of the elimination of prey by predation. However, when studying a predator-harvester, such as a planktivorous fish, which collects zooplankton at a rate of up to 1 prey s(-1), instantaneous replacement of each consumed prey item is not feasible. This problem was solved in short-lasting mesocosm experiments by minute-by-minute supplementation to replace eliminated Daphnia and maintain a constant average prey density. Such experiments were performed with different numbers of foraging roach (Rutilus rutilus) at three prey densities and in two ranges of ambient temperature. The number of Daphnia required at the start of each experiment to establish the initial prey density and the number that it was necessary to add per minute were determined in experiments conducted without prey supplementation and in preliminary experiments with prey supplementation. The results of this study revealed that fish foraging in a group eat less, due to both exploitation and non-aggressive competition for space. Moreover, the effect of interference competition was stronger at higher temperatures, irrespective of the prey density, indicating that natural populations of roach foraging in shoals may suffer more from competitive interactions in warmer waters.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1439-8621	1439-863X		WOS:000333889900005

For the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), an important predator in kelp forests and a target of commercial and recreational fisheries, we evaluated the degree to which different populations exhibited variation in density, demography, and life history traits. We assessed biogeographic patterns of abundance through underwater visual census at 39 sites spanning a major portion of the species range ( southern California, USA, to Baja California, Mexico) and made collections from seven focal sites to investigate geographic differences in demography and life histories. California sheephead densities were significantly greater in the southern part of their range and at offshore islands than along the mainland coast. At the focal sites, we found significant spatial variation in density, fecundity, size structure, growth rates, annual survivorship, and the timing of maturation and sex change. Density- and temperature-dependent effects helped to explain the intraspecific differences in these parameters. Studies such as this one will allow for demographic plasticity to be incorporated into future stock assessments. Management of temperate reef fishes may best be achieved on smaller spatial scales as we increase our understanding of geographic variation among populations.									43	0	0	0	39	0	44			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000288098700010

However, the effects of elevated CO2 on learning in advanced invertebrates such as cephalopods are unknown. Any impacts to the learning abilities of cephalopods could have far-reaching consequences for their populations and the communities they inhabit. Cephalopods have some of the most advanced cognitive abilities among invertebrates and are one of the few invertebrate taxa in which conditional discrimination has been demonstrated, though the trait has not been demonstrated in any species of squid. Here, we tested for the first time the capacity for conditional discrimination in a squid species (Sepioteuthis lessoniana). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of projected future CO2 levels (1,084 mu atm) on conditional discrimination and learning more generally. A three-task experiment within a two-choice arena was used to test learning and conditional discrimination. Learning was measured by improvements in task completion in repeated trials over time and the number of trials required to pass each task. Squid exhibited significant learning capabilities, with an increase in correct choices over successive trials and a decrease in the number of trials needed to complete the successive tasks. Six of the 12 squid tested successfully passed all three tasks indicating a capacity for conditional discrimination in the species. Elevated CO2 had no effect on learning or on the capacity for conditional discrimination in squid. This study highlights the remarkable cognitive abilities of S. lessoniana, demonstrated by their capacity for conditional discrimination, and suggests that ocean acidification will not compromise learning abilities. However, other behavioural traits in the species have been shown to be altered at comparable elevated CO2 conditions. It is not clear why some ecologically important behaviours are altered by elevated CO2 whereas others are unaffected. Future research should focus on the physiological mechanism responsible for altered behaviours in squid at elevated CO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000573344900009	33062415

Over the three larval instars, a lifetime total of about 300 aphids (third-instar equivalents) was consumed for a weight gain of 20 mg. Lifetime consumption was greater at lower temperatures. At 20 degrees C, the third-instar larva ate about 80% of the total, although this instar accounted for only 50% of larval development time. Melangyna viridiceps consumed more aphids than Symosyrphus grandicornis at 10 and 15 degrees C, Development of eggs, larvae and pupae of both species was studied at constant temperatures of 4, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Although eggs hatched at 4 degrees C, first-instar larvae died at this temperature. A computer program (PMDS) was used to fit temperature/development functions for all stages. Linear, LoganT(b), Stinner and exponential functions were fitted to the data. A day-degree program, using the parameters given by PMDS and records of daily maximum-minimum temperatures and data obtained from the field, suggested that the hoverflies might go through 10-13 generations per year in the field.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			1326-6756			WOS:000076234700007

In this laboratory study, we examined the effects of exposure to the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd]) on Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens) metamorphs that had been reared in the presence or absence of crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) predators in aquatic environments to determine whether prior predator exposure influenced the effect of Bd on terrestrial growth and survival of frogs. Although Bd exposure following metamorphosis did not impact Northern Leopard Frog survival, exposure did significantly reduce terrestrial growth, indicating that Bd exposure can have consequences that can indirectly impact populations, because size of amphibians is positively correlated with overwinter survival and fecundity. Exposure to predators during larval development, however, did not alter the impact of Bd exposure at metamorphosis on Northern Leopard Frogs. Our study suggests the Bd pathogen associated with global amphibian declines can have important sublethal impacts and play a role in population dynamics even when disease outbreaks do not occur.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000386669700009

We used non-invasive video-recording, photography and focal observations to build time-energy budget models and to directly estimate the fish mass delivered to chicks by adult greater crested terns Thalasseus bergii breeding in the Benguela ecosystem. Mean modelled adult daily food intake increased from 140.9 g.d(-1) of anchovy Engraulis capensis during incubation to 171.7 g.d(-1) and 189.2 g.d(-1) when provisioning small and large chicks, respectively. Modelled prey intake expected to be returned to chicks was 58.3 g.d(-1) (95% credible intervals: 44.9-75.8 g.d(-1)) over the entire growth period. Based on our observations, chicks were fed 19.9 g.d(-1) (17.2-23.0 g.d(-1)) to 45.1 g.d(-1) (34.6-58.7 g.d(-1)) of anchovy during early and late provisioning, respectively. Greater crested terns have lower energetic requirements at the individual (range: 15-34%) and population level (range: 1-7%) than the other Benguela endemic seabirds that feed on forage fish. These modest requirements - based on a small body size and low flight costs coupled with foraging plasticity have allowed greater crested terns to cope with changing prey availability, unlike the other seabirds species using the same exploited prey base.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000433291300046	29844530

Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are major primary producers worldwide that may be influenced by predator removal through changes in grazer composition and biomass. CCA have been most widely studied in Caribbean and temperate reefs, where cover increases with increasing grazer biomass due to removal of competitive fleshy algae. However, each of these systems has one dominant grazer type, herbivorous fishes or sea urchins, which may not be functionally equivalent. Where fishes and sea urchins co-occur, fishing can result in a phase shift in the grazing community with subsequent effects on CCA and other substrata. Kenyan reefs have herbivorous fishes and sea urchins, providing an opportunity to determine the relative impacts of each grazer type and evaluate potential human-induced trophic cascades. We hypothesized that fish benefit CCA, abundant sea urchins erode CCA, and that fishing indirectly reduces CCA cover by removing sea urchin predators. We used closures and fished reefs as a large-scale, long-term natural experiment to assess how fishing and resultant changes in communities affect CCA abundance. We used a short-term caging experiment to directly test the effects of grazing on CCA. CCA cover declined with increasing fish and sea urchin abundance, but the negative impact of sea urchin grazing was much stronger than that of fishes. Abundant sea urchins reduced the CCA growth rate to almost zero and prevented CCA accumulation. A warming event (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) occurred during the 18-year study and had a strong but short-term positive effect on CCA cover. However, the effect of the ENSO on CCA was lower in magnitude than the effect of sea urchin grazing. We compare our results with worldwide literature on bioerosion by fishes and sea urchins. Grazer influence depends on whether benefits of fleshy algae removal outweigh costs of grazer-induced bioerosion. However, the cost-benefit ratio for CCA appears to change with grazer type, grazer abundance, and environment. In Kenya, predator removal leads to a trophic cascade that is expected to reduce net calcification of reefs and therefore reduce reef stability, growth, and resilience.									76	0	0	0	71	0	76			0012-9658			WOS:000285635100020	21302830

We propose cooling events as an alternative mechanism leading to higher mortality for slower growing larvae. We observed that, in the absence of predators. slower growing pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) larvae had higher mortality compared to faster growing larvae during the unseasonably cool spring temperatures of 1998. However, this was not true for the warmer spring of 1999. Laboratory experiments showed that the probability of surviving a chill coma increased with larval mass. We propose that smaller larvae are susceptible to chilling events because they have less energy reserved for metabolism during a chill coma. and that "warm" chill events near the activity threshold may be more lethal than "cold" chill events. Weather station data since 195 1 and field data collected from 1976 to 2000 suggest that exposure to chill events below the chill coma threshold is not uncommon for these larvae. We propose that faster growth may be important for larvae because slower growing larvae remain at a chill-susceptible size for an extended period of time.									57	3	0	0	55	0	59			0012-9658			WOS:000180792700023

Agricultural intensification in the breeding range is often regarded as one of the main drivers of these declines. Here, we tested the hypothesis that body mass in breeding individuals should reflect habitat quality in an aerial insectivore, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), along a gradient of agricultural intensity. Our dataset was collected over 7 years (2005-2011) and included 2918 swallow captures and 1483 broods. Analyses revealed a substantial decline of the population over the course of the study (-19% occupancy rate), mirrored by decreasing body mass. This trend was especially severe in females, representing a total loss of 8% of their mass. Reproductive success was negatively influenced by intensive agriculture, but did not decrease over time. Interestingly, variation in body mass was independent of breeding habitat quality, leading us to suggest that this decline in body mass may result from carry-over effects from non-breeding areas and affect population dynamics through reduced survival. This work contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that declines in migratory aerial insectivores are driven by multiple, complex factors requiring better knowledge of year-round habitat use.									47	0	0	0	45	0	47			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000336784500027	24850929

The highest number of prey in the stomach occured in summer in both 1987 and 1988. Specimens larger than 4 cm in radius had mature gonads. The reproductive cycle was determined by gonad indices and histological analysis of gonads. In 1988, the species exhibited an annual reproductive cycle with spawning in December. The pyloric caecum indices showed the highest values between April and July. The relationship between gonad index and pyloric caecum index was inverse. The pyloric caecum peak occurred during the downwelling period (fall and winter) when warm tropical waters (Brazil Current) were inshore. The reproductive peak coincided with the upwelling period (during spring and summer) enabling the larvae to benefit from the richer water condition when phytoplankton are more abundant.					7th International Congress on Invertebrate Reproduction7th International Congress on Invertebrate Reproduction	AUG 05-11, 1995AUG 05-11, 1995	Int Soc Invertebrate ReprodInt Soc Invertebrate Reprod	UNIV OF CALIF AT SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CAUNIV OF CALIF AT SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CA	27	1	0	0	27	4	29			0168-8170			WOS:A1997WH55500015

The effect of two temperatures (20 and 24 degrees C), four salinities (20, 25, 30 and 37 parts per thousand) and two food levels (15 000 and 25 000 cells ml(-1)) on the life history traits of this rotifer were studied in life tables performed with replicated individual cultures. Temperature and salinity had a significant negative effect (P < 0.001) on the average lifespan (LS) and on the number of offspring per female (R-0) The effect of food level on LS is unclear, whereas R-0 is greater at 20 degrees C with the lower concentration of algae and at 24 degrees C with the higher algal concentration. The maximum values of LS and R-0, 5.6 days and 9.2 offspring per female. respectively, were recorded at 20 degrees C, 25 parts per thousand salinity and low food concentration. There is also a clear negative effect on the intrinsic growth rate (r) due to salinity. ?he effect of temperature depends on the food level and, as occurs with R-0, the maximum values of r occur with the lower algal concentration at 20 degrees C, whereas at 24 degrees C they are obtained with the higher algal concentration. These r values, from 1.04 to 1.10 day(-1), were reached at 24 degrees C, salinities of 20-25 parts per thousand and with high food concentration.									16	1	0	0	15	1	17			0142-7873			WOS:A1997XE19900003

The magnitudes of these effects are contingent on predator and prey traits that may change with environmental conditions. Aberrant thermal regimes could disrupt pest suppression through asymmetric effects, e.g. heat-sensitive predator vs. heat-tolerant prey. To explore potential effects of warming on suppressing pests and controlling herbivory in a vegetable crop, we performed laboratory experiments exposing an important pest species to two spider predator species at different temperatures. Heat tolerance was characterised by the critical thermal maxima parameter (CTM50) of the cucumber beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata), wolf spider (Tigrosa helluo), and nursery web spider (Pisaurina mira). Cucumber beetles and wolf spiders were equally heat tolerant (CTM50 > 40 degrees C), but nursery web spiders had limited heat tolerance (CTM50 = 34 degrees C). Inside mesocosms, beetle feeding increased with temperature, wolf spiders were always effective predators, nursery web spiders were less lethal at high temperature (38 degrees C). Neither spider species reduced herbivory at ambient temperature (22 degrees C), however, at warm temperature both species reduced herbivory with evidence of a dominant non-consumptive effect. Our experiments highlight the contingent nature of predator-prey interactions and suggest that nonconsumptive effects should not be ignored when assessing the impact of temperature change.									3	0	0	0	3	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000406980800005	28779159

We documented the sudden appearance of benthic cyanobacterial mats on a subtidal rocky reef (Roca Cousins, Galapagos Islands) during El Nino in January 2016. At this time, cyanobacteria covered 32.0% of horizontal rock surfaces and 2.6% of rock walls at 6-8 m depth. Monitored photo quadrats and observations indicated that these mats were previously absent from rock walls and horizontal-sloping substrata at this site for 16 years prior to their initial appearance. The cyanobacteria was also observed at 4 other sites in the central Galapagos Islands during 2016-2018. Laboratory experiments testing the effects of temperature (28-31 degrees C) on cyanobacterial growth and survival indicated that survival was higher at 28 than 31 degrees C, suggesting that 31 degrees C may be an upper thermal limit. Over two years in the field, cyanobacterial mats peaked during the warm El Nino (January 2016) and declined during two cold La Nina periods (June 2016, September 2017), ultimately declining to 6.0% cover in January 2018. Regression analysis of the temperature and cyanobacterial percent cover data indicated that temperature explained 56.9% of the variation in cyanobacteria cover in the field over the 2-year period. The cyanobacterial mats may be a consortium of several species as the closest genetic matches confirmed by Sanger sequencing (90-91.5%) were Oscillatoria spongeliae, Merismopedia glauca, and Synechococcus elongatus. Comparison of areas under the cyanobacterial mats to the adjacent uncovered rock substrata suggested that the cyanobacteria had a negative influence on underlying crustose coralline algae (CCA), as the cover of bleached CCA was 1.75 fold higher under the mats while the cover of "healthy" pink-pigmented CCA was 3 fold higher on the uncovered substrata. Short-term field experiments and feeding surveys performed to evaluate predation and to calculate electivity indices indicated that the cyanobacterial mats were avoided by dominant consumers (Eucidaris galapagensis, Pentaceraster cumingi, Nidorellia armata, and Prionurus laticlavius). Taken together, these results imply that the novel appearance of cyanobacterial mats in the Galapagos rocky subtidal zone was facilitated by unusually warm temperatures during the 2014-2017 El Nino (28-29 degrees C) and that the cyanobacteria were regulated by temperature, but not by consumers. Future outbreaks of mat-forming cyanobacteria during El Nino periods may negatively impact the abundance of CCA and have direct and indirect negative effects on other components of marine benthic communities that rely on CCA as either a settlement substratum or food source.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000469155100003

Using time-series covering a 30 yr period, we show that the body growth of the central Baltic Sea herring Clupea harengus, both in terms of condition and weight-at-age (WAA), has shifted from being mainly driven by hydro-climatic forces to an interspecific density-dependent control. The shift in the mechanisms of regulation of herring growth is triggered by the abundance of sprat, the main food competitor for herring. Abundances of sprat above the threshold of similar to 18 x 10(10) ind. decouple herring growth from hydro-climatic factors (i.e. salinity), and become the main driver of herring growth variations. At high sprat densities, herring growth is considerably lower than at low sprat levels, regardless of the salinity conditions, indicative of hysteresis in the response of herring growth to salinity changes. The threshold dynamic accurately explains the changes in herring growth during the past 3 decades and in turn contributes to elucidate the parallel drastic drop in herring spawning stock biomass. Studying the interplay between different stressors can provide fundamental information for the management of exploited resources. The management of the central Baltic herring stock should be adaptive and take into consideration the dual response of herring growth to hydro-climatic forces and food-web structure for a sound ecosystem approach to fisheries.									70	0	0	0	65	0	70			0171-8630			WOS:000281566900019		
J	Amundrud, Sarah L.; Srivastava, Diane S.

Although many ecological processes have been evoked to explain both patterns, the environmental stress associated with small habitats has rarely been considered. We propose that larger habitats may be species rich simply because their environmental conditions are within the fundamental niche of more species; larger habitats may also have more trophic levels if traits of predators render them vulnerable to environmental stress. We test this hypothesis using the aquatic insect larvae in water-filled bromeliads. In bromeliads, the probability of desiccation is greatest in small plants. For the 10 most common bromeliad insect taxa, we ask whether differences in drought tolerance and regional abundances between taxa predict community and trophic composition over a gradient of bromeliad size. First, we used bromeliad survey data to calculate the mean habitat size of occurrence of each taxon. Comparing the observed mean habitat size of occurrence to that expected from random species assembly based on differences in their regional abundances allowed us to obtain habitat size sensitivity indices (as Z scores) for the various insect taxa. Second, we obtained drought sensitivity indices by subjecting individual insects to drought and measuring the effects on relative growth rates in a mesocosm experiment. We found that drought sensitivity strongly predicts habitat size sensitivity in bromeliad insects. However, an increase in trophic richness with habitat size could not be explained by an increased sensitivity of predators to drought, but rather by sampling effects, as predators were rare compared to lower trophic levels. This finding suggests that physiological tolerance to environmental stress can be relevant in explaining the universal increase in species with habitat size.									30	0	0	0	28	0	30			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000357525800022	26378317

Bycatch mortality from fisheries is clearly among the most serious global threats for marine ecosystems, affecting a wide range of top predators. Recent estimates report ca. 200,000 seabirds killed annually by bycatch in European waters. However, there is an urgent need to rigorously estimate actual mortality rates and quantify effects of bycatch on populations. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the most impacted regions. Here, we estimate for the first time both bycatch mortality rates and their population-level effects on three endemic and vulnerable Mediterranean taxa: Scopoli's shearwater, Mediterranean shag, and Audouin's gull, that die in different types of fishing gears: longlines, gillnets and sport trolling, respectively. We use multi-event capture-recapture modelling to estimate crucial demographic parameters, including the probabilities of dying in different fishing gears. We then build stochastic demography models to forecast the viability of the populations under different management scenarios. Longline bycatch was particularly severe for adults of Scopoli's shearwaters and Audouin's gulls (ca. 28% and 23% of total mortality, respectively) and also for immature gulls (ca. 90% of mortality). Gillnets had a lower impact, but were still responsible for ca. 9% of juvenile mortality on shags, whereas sport trolling only slightly influenced total mortality in gulls. Bycatch mortality has high population-level impacts in all three species, with shearwaters having the highest extinction risk under current mortality rates. Different life-history traits and compensatory demographic mechanisms between the three species are probably influencing the different bycatch impact: for shearwaters, urgent conservation actions are required to ensure the viability of their populations. Results will be very useful for guiding future seabird conservation policies and moving towards an ecosystem-based approach to sustainable fisheries management.									12	0	0	0	13	0	13			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000404863300007	28231421

Oysters were fed a monospecific microalgal diet of Isochrysis affinis galbana (T-iso). Measurements of oxygen consumption and ingestion rates were carried out at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C and at two algal (T-iso) concentrations: 5000 and 30 000 cell ml(-1). Glycogen content in adductor muscle, absorption efficiency and scope for growth were also estimated. Females and males responded differently to environmental factors, with food level being the most influential parameter. Oxygen consumption and absorption efficiency were significantly higher in females than in males, but males had significantly higher glycogen content than females. At high food concentration, glycogen content, ingestion rate, oxygen consumption, and scope for growth were significantly higher than at the low food concentration. Only absorption efficiency was significantly higher at the low food concentration. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher at 27 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. These results indicate that females and males have different bioenergetic functioning and that energy demands for reproduction are higher in females.									15	0	1	0	14	0	16			0990-7440	1765-2952		WOS:000324283000008

Different mixes of warm-season grasses and forbs were established to improve the habitat quality of fields enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for gamebirds in the Southern Plains. We analyzed the feeding ecology of human-imprinted, 4- to 10-day-old ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) chicks in wheat fields and 4 types of conservation practices (CP) fields enrolled in CRP (CP10, improved CP10, CP2, and CP25) in western Kansas, USA, during June and July, 2004 and 2005. Foraging rates were greatest for bobwhite chicks in improved CP10 and CP25 fields and greatest for pheasant chicks in CP10 and CP25 fields. Vegetation characteristics such as bare ground cover appear to have a significant impact on insect selection, because the diet was more diverse for both species in fields with more bare ground. The CP25 fields provided the best combination of mobility and diet breadth for both species. Although herbicide-treated wheat fields had low feeding rates, we determined non-herbicide-treated fields (i.e., weedy wheat) provided easy mobility and feeding rates similar to CRP fields. We suggest that management of vegetation to benefit gamebirds does not affect species equally. Feeding rates of bobwhite chicks were sensitive to vegetation-influenced mobility. Management of CRP fields for both pheasant and bobwhite chicks can be reconciled by practices that permit more open space at ground level, such as light disking or burning, to permit easier movement for chicks.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0022-541X	1937-2817		WOS:000274243800010

THE DIET OF CERULEAN WARBLER (SETOPHAGA CERULEA) NESTLINGS AND ADULT NEST PROVISIONING BEHAVIORS IN SOUTHERN INDIANA								WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY				128	3			573	583		10.1676/1559-4491-128.3.573				SEP 2016	2016	We studied the diet of nestling Cerulean Warblers (Setophaga cerulea) and the provisioning behaviors of parents in southern Indiana. The Cerulean Warbler, a small insectivorous passerine breeding in eastern North American deciduous forests, is one of the fastest declining Neotropical wood warblers. Our primary objectives were to determine the importance of specific prey items in the diet of nestling Cerulean Warblers, and to assess whether the proportion of lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) in the diet changed during the breeding season. We also describe general nest provisioning behavior, including differences between females and males, and assess breeding success across years. We video-taped provisioning behavior to determine the prey types (insects and arachnids) that parent Cerulean Warblers fed their young during the breeding season in 2013 and compared the proportions of lepidopteran larvae in the diet to that in the environment. The proportion of lepidopteran larvae in the nestling diet was 53% (n = 194/366) across the entire breeding season in 2013 and 83% during the peak nestling period which occurred in late May to early June. The proportion of lepidopteran larvae in the diet was 3.8 times greater than the proportion of lepidopteran larvae available. The proportion of lepidopteran larvae in the nestling diet decreased during the breeding season and was 80% reduced for the last nest of the season compared to the first nest. Additional observations from 2011 and 2012 were similar where lepidopteran larvae composed 65% (n = 15/23) and 44% (n = 8/18) of the diet, respectively. The mean length of arthropods in the diet was 15 mm compared to a mean length of 6 mm in the environment. Other prey items fed to nestlings included Orthoptera, Diptera, Neuroptera, Arachnida, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Phasmida. The average feeding rate during 2011-2013 was 4.31 +/- 0.34 deliveries/30 mins, and males fed more frequently than females. Mayfield nest success was 35% in 2011 (n = 12), 6% in 2012 (n = 12), and 33% (n = 27) in 2013. We conclude that lepidopteran larvae were the main food source for nestling Cerulean Warblers and that the proportion of lepidopteran larvae in their diet was the highest during peak numbers of nestlings at the end of May and early June.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			1559-4491	1938-5447		WOS:000384566900011

Understanding the environmental associations of spatial variation in population change can help tease out the likely mechanisms involved. Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus populations have declined by 69% in England but increased by 33% in Scotland. The declines have mainly occurred in lowland agricultural landscapes, but their mechanisms are unknown. At both the local scale within the county of Devon (SE England) and at the national (UK) scale, we analysed the breeding season distribution of Cuckoos in relation to habitat variation, the abundance of host species and the abundance of moth species whose caterpillars are a key food of adult Cuckoos. At the local scale, we found that Cuckoos were more likely to be detected in areas with more semi-natural habitat, more Meadow Pipits Anthus pratensis (but fewer Dunnocks Prunella modularis) and where, later in the summer, higher numbers of moths were captured whose larvae are Cuckoo prey. Nationally, Cuckoos have become more associated with upland heath characterized by the presence of Meadow Pipit hosts, and with wetland habitats occupied by Eurasian Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus hosts. The core distribution of Cuckoos has shifted from south to north within the UK. By the end of 2009, the abundance of macro-moth species identified as prey had also declined four times faster than that of species not known to be taken by Cuckoos. The abundance of these moths has shown the sharpest declines in grassland, arable and woodland habitats and has increased in semi-natural habitats (heaths and rough grassland). Our study suggests that Cuckoos are likely to remain a very scarce bird in lowland agricultural landscapes without large-scale changes in agricultural practices.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			0019-1019	1474-919X		WOS:000461902700009

Based on life table studies, it has been proposed that the growth of aphid populations could be modeled with an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time. This model has never been tested under field conditions.2 The soybean aphid Aphis glycines is a new invasive pest to soybean production in the U.S.A. In the present study, we present five datasets on the growth of colonies of A. glycines, monitored during population growth and decline under predator-free conditions in three soybean fields, from 2003 to 2006.3 We demonstrate that an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time, gives a much better description of A. glycines dynamics for all datasets (R-2 = 0.94-0.99) than the exponential (R-2 = 0.42-0.98) or logistic growth models (R-2 = 0.77-0.99). Furthermore, it is shown by cross-validation that the exponential model with decreasing r can be used to make population predictions, as shown by the coefficient of prediction, R-pred(2) ranging from 0.55 to 0.97. An improved proved fit of the model was obtained using both aphid (R-pred(2) > 0.79) and soybean pred (R-pred(2) > 0.86) degree-days scales, indicating temperature effects on the phenological time scale for the decrease in r.4 Our model suggests important bottom-up control of A. glycines population growth, which may interact with other mortality factors. The generality and potential applications of these results are discussed.									31	0	0	0	28	0	31			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000250631600006

Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), an insect that responds evasively to echolocation calls of bats. Simulated echolocation was broadcast over crop fields in an area where moths were abundant during summer. Field collections of free-flying moths and pheromone trapping of male moths were conducted in the presence and absence of simulated calls. Numbers of moths captured were not affected in either experiment by presence of simulated echolocation calls. Contrary to previous evidence, these data suggest that moths are not dissuaded from tracking pheromones under a perceived high risk of predation. Exhibiting a continual anti-predator response under a sustained risk of predation could have negative impacts on reproductive success, leading males to take higher risks compared to situations in which predators are sporadically present.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0038-4909	1943-6262		WOS:000289039400016

Here we use the Framework on Ocean Observing (FOO) to begin developing ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (eEOVs) for the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). An eEOV is a defined biological or ecological quantity, which is derived from field observations,, and which contributes significantly to assessments of Southern Ocean ecosystems. Here, assessments are concerned with estimating status and trends in ecosystem properties, attribution of trends to causes, and predicting future trajectories. eEOVs should be feasible to collect at appropriate spatial and temporal scales and are useful to the extent that they contribute to direct estimation of trends and/or attribution, and/or development of ecological (statistical or simulation) models to support assessments. In this paper we outline the rationale, including establishing a set of criteria, for selecting eEOVs for the SOOS and develop a list of candidate eEOVs for further evaluation. Other than habitat variables, nine types of eEOVs for Southern Ocean taxa are identified within three classes: state (magnitude, genetic/species, size spectrum), predator-prey (diet, foraging range), and autecology (phenology, reproductive rate, individual growth rate, detritus). Most candidates for the suite of Southern Ocean taxa relate to state or diet. Candidate autecological eEOVs have not been developed other than for marine mammals and birds. We consider some of the spatial and temporal issues that will influence the adoption and use of eEOVs in an observing system in the Southern Ocean, noting that existing operations and platforms potentially provide coverage of the four main sectors of the region the East and West Pacific, Atlantic and Indian. Lastly, we discuss the importance of simulation modelling in helping with the design of the observing system in the long term. Regional boundary: south of 30 degrees S. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We quantified the amount of pollen consumed by C. maculata second, third and fourth instars and adults in the field.2 Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the digestion rate and duration of different stadia or stages using temperature regimens that reflected field conditions during anthesis. Coleomegilla maculata larvae and adults were collected from the field and the amount of pollen in their digestive tracts was determined gravimetrically. The rate of digestion, duration of each life stage and the field observations were used to estimate the amount of pollen consumed by second, third and fourth instars and adults.3 Our models estimate that larvae consume 0.66, 1.67 and 3.30 mg of pollen during the second, third and fourth stadia, respectively. Adults consumed an estimated 13.15 mg during anthesis.4 The relevance of our results to ecological risk assessment of transgenic insecticidal corn and predator life history strategies is discussed. The results presented here are a first attempt to quantify pollen consumption by a predator, and future areas of research are suggested.									42	1	0	0	44	1	47			1461-9555			WOS:000226910700006

Juvenile southern elephant seals (SES) Mirounga leonina are considered generalist predators within the Southern Ocean. Although mesopelagic fish and squid dominate their stomach lavage samples, the stable isotope profile captured along the length of sampled vibrissae of young SES at Macquarie Island, southwest Pacific Ocean (54.5 degrees S, 158.9 degrees E) recently emphasized the contribution of crustaceans to their diet (likely Euphausia superba). Herein, we used the stable isotope values of sampled vibrissal regrowths with known growth histories to assess the diet of juvenile SES at Marion Island, southern Indian Ocean (46.8 degrees S, 37.8 degrees E) on a temporally integrated basis. We specifically aimed to quantify the possible contribution of crustaceans to the diet of juvenile SES. Sequentially (chronologically) sampled vibrissal regrowths of 14 juvenile SES produced fine-scale dietary information spanning up to 9 mo. The depleted stable isotope signatures of nitrogen (delta N-15) (8.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) and carbon (delta C-13) (-20.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) measured during the period of independent foraging suggested the use of a lower trophic level diet within the Polar Frontal Zone. A mixing model predicted that up to 76% of juvenile SES diet comprised crustaceans, consisting of 2 crustacean groups, each contributing 26% (credible interval, CI: 13-39%) and 50% (CI: 35-64%) to their diets, presumably representing subantarctic krill species. This first utilisation of the isotopic signature captured along the length of vibrissal regrowths confirms the inclusion and importance of crustaceans in the diet of juvenile SES.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000411307400017

They are distributed unevenly; with the greatest number and density occurring in the Oriental Biogeographic Region and the smallest in the East Palearctic. Ecosystem services provided by Trichoptera are also very diverse and include their essential roles in food webs, in biological monitoring of water quality, as food for fish and other predators (many of which are of human concern), and as engineers that stabilize gravel bed sediment. They are especially important in capturing and using a wide variety of nutrients in many forms, transforming them for use by other organisms in freshwaters and surrounding riparian areas. The general pattern of evolution for trichopteran families is becoming clearer as more genes from more taxa are sequenced and as morphological characters are becoming understood in greater detail. This increasingly credible phylogeny provides a foundation for interpreting and hypothesizing the functional traits of this diverse order of freshwater organisms and for understanding the richness of the ecological services corresponding with those traits. Our research also is gaining insight into the timing of evolutionary diversification in the order. Correlations for the use of angiosperm plant material as food and case construction material by the earliest ancestors of infraorder Plenitentoria-by at least 175 Ma-may provide insight into the timing of the origin of angiosperms.									15	0	0	0	15	0	16			2075-4450			WOS:000476846800007	31052441

Egg masses, oviposition site preferences, and abiotic and biotic factors causing mortality during embryonic, larval and adult life stages of Apatania fimbriata were studied. Laboratory investigations provided information on the temperature dependence of embryonic development, measured as an increase in egg volume.2. A. fimbriata laid hemispherical egg masses, consisting of a transparent matrix containing a mean of 208 eggs. Egg masses were laid on stones situated just above the water surface in dark cavities in the stream bank.3. Two hundred egg masses were mapped and individually monitored during embryonic development. There was no significant correlation between mortality during embryonic development and any of the abiotic parameters measured. First-instar larvae of Osmylus fulvicephalus consumed developing eggs, and chironomids preyed on newly hatched larvae.4. A mean of seventy-two females emerged per metre of stream. Mortality during the 1993/94 life cycle was measured as a percentage of the potential number of eggs laid. Female mortality between emergence and oviposition was approximate to 80%. Eight per cent of individuals were lost during embryonic development. Larval mortality to emergence in 1994 was 11.3%. This indicates that the terrestrial life stage is probably decisive in the regulation of A. fimbriata populations.5. Duration of embryogenesis at constant temperatures (4-20 degrees C) in the laboratory was described best by a negative exponential function. This species is cold stenothermal and there was no hatching success at 20 degrees C.6. Egg volumes during embryonic development increased sigmoidally over time.									35	0	0	0	30	0	36			0046-5070			WOS:A1996VB54100009

In 2012, its landings peaked to an all-time record making it the fifth largest sardine fishery in the world, and within 3 years the catches were reduced to nearly a tenth of that level. This study examined the fishery dependant factors such as effort, catch rates and expansion of fishing area; the biological variations in fish size, maturity and recruitment; and tried to relate this to the environmental variations in the sardine habitat and food availability. The 2012 mega harvest was a result of a 2-time increase in gear size and engine capacity of fishing crafts and a 3.7-time increase in fishing effort. The female maturation process was strongly influenced primarily by rainfall and then by upwelling and the resulting influx of cold nutrient-rich water in the habitat from April much before the start of the monsoon in June. After 2013, the weak monsoons and the 2015 El Nino Southern Oscillation resulted in a warmer (by an average of 1.1 degrees C) period which negatively impacted the maturation process. The abundance of jellyfishes which are larval and young fish predators in the habitat negatively affected recruitment after 2013. The mismatch in timing of phytoplankton productivity and sardine larvae in the habitat also affected the recruitment success. These environmental divergences coupled with the excessive capture (beyond maximum sustainable yields) of spawning stock and juveniles from 2010 has resulted in this biological catastrophe which has affected the livelihood of thousands of small-scale fishers. A more responsive fisheries administration with timely restriction on fishing effort and protection of spawning stocks by way of fishery closure would have helped minimize the impacts.									4	0	0	0	4	0	5				2296-7745		WOS:000457229200002

Although the diversity of Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification, increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains unknown. Here, we experimentally show interspecific and intraspecific variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of translocated carbon and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of different isoclonal lines of Symbiodinium minutum, while a combination with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts. The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate symbioses such as reef-building corals.									41	0	0	0	37	0	41			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000351397500010	25617454
