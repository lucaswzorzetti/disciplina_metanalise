Contrary to expectations, predator attack rates significantly decreased with increasing temperature. Handling times were significantly longer at 19 degrees C than at 17 and 15 degrees C and the maximum feeding estimate was significantly lower at 19 degrees C than at 17 degrees C. Functional-response type changed from a destabilizing type II to the more stabilizing type III with a temperature increase to 19 degrees C. This suggests that a temperature increase can mediate refuge for prey at low densities. Predatory pressure by teleosts may be dampened by a large increase in temperature (here from 15 to 19 degrees C), but a short-term and smaller temperature increase (to 17 degrees C) may increase destabilizing resource consumption due to high maximum feeding rates; this has implications for the stability of important intertidal ecosystems during warming events.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000419307300010	29139120

One mechanism by which temperature may affect stability is by altering trophic interactions. The functional response quantifies the per capita resource consumption by the consumer as a function of resource abundance and is a suitable framework for the description of nonlinear trophic interactions. We studied the effect of temperature on a ciliate predator-prey pair (Spathidium sp. and Dexiostoma campylum) by estimating warming effects on the functional response and on the associated conversion efficiency of the predator. We recorded prey and predator dynamics over 24 hr and at three temperature levels (15, 20 and 25 degrees C). To these data, we fitted a population dynamic model including the predator functional response, such that the functional response parameters (space clearance rate, handling time and density dependence of space clearance rate) were estimated for each temperature separately. To evaluate the ecological significance of temperature effects on the functional response parameters, we simulated predator-prey population dynamics. We considered the predator-prey system to be destabilized, if the prey was driven extinct by the predator. Effects of increased temperature included a transition of the functional response from a Type III to a Type II and an increase of the conversion efficiency of the predator. The simulated population dynamics showed a destabilization of the system with warming, with greater risk of prey extinction at higher temperatures likely caused by the transition from a Type III to a Type II functional response. Warming-induced shifts from a Type III to II are not commonly considered in modelling studies that investigate how population dynamics respond to warming. Future studies should investigate the mechanism and generality of the effect we observed and simulate temperature effects in complex food webs including shifts in the type of the functional response as well as consider the possibility of a temperature-dependent conversion efficiency.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000479518800001	31257583

Due to the effects of temperature on both the physiology and the behaviour of such ectotherms, understanding how global warming may influence their ecological impact is a research priority. These species were therefore exposed to three different food types to determine their detritivorous, herbivorous and carnivorous characters, and predation was measured characterizing the Holling's functional response. The effect of increasing water temperatures (15, 20, 25A degrees C) on both the food choice and predatory activities was investigated. Both species showed a significant preference for animal tissues at all temperatures. The total food intake increased with temperature for G. tigrinus but did not change for D. villosus, which may result from specific species differences in metabolic requirements. The consumption of live prey strongly increased with temperature. The main differences were an increased searching efficiency in G. tigrinus and a decreased handling time in D. villosus as temperature increased, which may result from differences in foraging strategies. These results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the predation pressure of both invasive gammarids on prey species.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000385154400004

In this study, we used comparative functional responses (FRs) to compare resource utilisation (i.e. per capita effects) between young-of-year Largemouth Bass and Florida Bass across different temperatures treatments (18, 24 and 30 degrees C). Culex mosquito larvae were used as prey during the experiments. Across all temperature treatments, Type II FRs were observed, which could cause population-destabilising pressures towards native prey communities due to high predation rates at low prey densities. Attack rates did not differ significantly between the fish species at either temperature. Handling times of Largemouth Bass increased significantly with temperature, whilst the converse was true for Florida Bass. Largemouth Bass were found to have higher maximum feeding rates at the low temperature (18 degrees C), driven by significantly shorter handling times compared to Florida Bass. At the intermediate temperature (24 degrees C), handling times and thus maximum feeding rates did not differ significantly between the two species. At high temperature (30 degrees C) Florida Bass exhibited a significantly higher maximum feeding rate and shorter handling time than Largemouth Bass. These results suggest that temperature drives differential ecological impacts, with Florida Bass exerting higher impact than Largemouth Bass on prey at high temperatures and Largemouth Bass having higher impacts than Florida Bass at lower temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000511976500005

These interactions can be altered directly by changing consumption rates, or indirectly by altering growth rates and size asymmetries among individuals that in turn affect feeding. Understanding these processes is particularly important for intraspecific interactions, as direct and indirect changes may exacerbate antagonistic interactions. We examined the effect of temperature on activity rate, growth and intraspecific size asymmetries, and how these temperature dependencies affected cannibalism in Lestes congener, a damselfly with marked intraspecific variation in size. Temperature increased activity rates and exacerbated differences in body size by increasing growth rates. Increased activity and changes in body size interacted to increase cannibalism at higher temperatures. We argue that our results are likely to be general to species with life-history stages that vary in their temperature dependencies, and that the effects of climate change on communities may depend on the temperature dependencies of intraspecific interactions.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000407093800014	28515331

Despite extensive research looking at the factors underlying foraging interactions, there remains ongoing controversy about how temperature and body size control the functional response parameters space clearance (or attack) rate and handling time. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature, consumer mass, and resource mass using the largest compilation of functional responses yet assembled. This compilation contains 2,083 functional response curves covering a wide range of foragers and prey types, environmental conditions, and habitats. After accounting for experimental arena size, dimensionality of the foraging interaction, and consumer taxon, we find that both space clearance rate and handling time are optimized at intermediate temperatures (a unimodal rather than monotonic response), suggesting that the response to global climate change depends on the location of the consumer's current temperature relative to the optimum. We further confirm that functional responses are higher and steeper for large consumers and small resources, and models using consumer and resource masses separately outperformed models using consumer:resource mass ratios, suggesting that consumer and resource body mass act independently to set interaction strengths. Lastly, we show that the extent to which foraging is affected by temperature or mass depends on the taxonomic identity of the consumer and the dimensionality of the consumer-resource interaction. We thus argue that although overall body size and temperature effects can be identified, they are not universal, and therefore food web and community modeling approaches could be improved by considering taxonomic identity along with body size and unimodal temperature effects.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000538111800021	31944271

However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator-prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator-prey interactions. This implies that warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator-prey oscillations thus stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however, include predator starvation due to energetic inefficiency despite abundant resources.									147	2	0	0	135	0	148			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000286837900005

Although extensive research has been carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature on animal life histories and to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds as well as the optimal temperatures for survival, development, and reproduction, few studies have investigated links between thermal window, metabolism, and trophic interactions such as predation. We developed models and conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how temperature influences predator-prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional response) using a ladybeetle larva feeding on aphid prey. As predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology, we found that handling time exponentially decreases with warming, but-in contrast with this theory-search rate follows a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. An examination of the model reveals that temperature thresholds for predation depend mainly on search rate, suggesting that predation rate is primarily determined by searching activities and secondly by prey handling. In contrast with prior studies, our model shows that per capita short-term predator-prey interaction strengths and predator energetic efficiency (per capita feeding rate relative to metabolism) generally increase with temperature, reach an optimum, and then decrease at higher temperatures. We conclude that integrating the concept of thermal windows in short- and long-term ecological studies would lead to a better understanding of predator-prey population dynamics at thermal limits and allow better predictions of global warming effects on natural ecosystems.									64	1	0	0	61	0	65			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000306494800025	22271203

Comparisons of functional responses can improve our understanding of underlying processes involved in altering species interaction strengths and may predict the effect of species invading new communities. Therefore, we investigated the functional responses of the mourning gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris (Dumeril & Bibron, 1836) to explore how temperature, body-size and prey density alter gecko predatory impacts in ecosystems. We quantified the functional responses of juvenile and adult geckos in single-predator experiments at 20, 23 and 26 degrees C. Both displayed saturating Type-II functional responses, but juvenile functional responses and the novel Functional Response Ratio were positively affected by temperature as juvenile attack rates (a) increased as a function of increased temperature. Handling times (h) tended to shorten at higher temperature for both predator stages. We demonstrate that the effects of temperature on functional responses of geckos differ across ontogeny, perhaps reflecting life-history stages prioritising growth and maturation or body maintenance. This indicates that temperature-dependent gecko predatory impacts will be mediated by population demographics. We advocate further comparisons of functional responses to understand the invasiveness and future predatory impacts of geckos, and other invasive species globally, as temperatures change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000543969500020	32572111

Interaction strengths between organisms are likely to change along with environmental changes, given interspecific heterogeneity in responses to physico-chemical variables. Biological interaction outcomes have the potential to alter food web production and trophic level biomass distribution. This is particularly pertinent for key species that are either abundant or play disproportionately large roles in ecosystem processes. Using a functional response approach, we quantified the effects of shifting temperatures on interactions between key mysid species-sympatric in their distribution across a biogeographic transition zone along the east coast of South Africa. The Rhopalophthalmus terranatalis functional response type toward Mesopodopsis wooldridgei prey was independent of temperature, with all treatments producing Type II functional responses. Temperature effects on predator-prey dynamics were, however, evident as interaction strength was greatest at 21 degrees C, as measured by maximum feeding rates. Unlike maximum feeding rate, attack rates increased linearly with increasing temperature across the experimental treatments, Our findings suggest that interaction strength between the mysid shrimp species is likely to vary spatially along the current length of their sympatric distribution and temporally in certain regions where temperatures are projected to change. Such experimental interaction investigations are becoming increasingly important given our relatively poor understanding of the consequences of environmental change for effects on interactions among species and their-wider ecosystem implications.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0141-1136	1879-0291		WOS:000447579500037	30054133

Here, we investigated the effect of increased seawater temperatures on the metabolic and consumption rates of five distinct marine species. The experimental species reflected different trophic positions within a typical benthic East Atlantic food web, and included a herbivorous gastropod, a scavenging decapod, a predatory echinoderm, a decapod and a benthic-feeding fish. We examined the metabolism-body mass and consumption-body mass scaling for each species, and assessed changes in their consumption efficiencies. Our results indicate that body mass and temperature effects on metabolism were inconsistent across species and that some species were unable to meet metabolic demand at higher temperatures, thus highlighting the vulnerability of individual species to warming. While body size explains a large proportion of the variation in species' physiological responses to warming, it is clear that idiosyncratic species responses, irrespective of body size, complicate predictions of population and ecosystem level response to future scenarios of climate change.									22	0	0	0	21	0	22			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000309253400008	23007085

Gut-residence time was also evaluated for M.relicta fed cladoceran prey at 4, 10 and 15 degrees C Mean daily consumption (g dry weight of Daphnia g(-1) dry weight of Mysis day(-1)) ranged from 6% at 4 degrees C to 12% at 10 degrees C. At 18 degrees C, Mysis feeding rate declined to 9% day(-1). Mean, weight-adjusted consumption rates exhibited a 'dome-shaped' response in relation to water temperature. Consumption rate was highest at 10 degrees C and lowest at 4 degrees C. Estimated Q(10) was more sensitive from 4 to 10 degrees C (Q(10) = 3) than from 10 to 15 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.2) Gut-residence time for Mysis was inversely related to water temperature, implying that evacuation rate increases linearly with water temperature. Feeding and gut-evacuation rates become disassociated at water temperatures >10 degrees C As water temperature increased above 10 degrees C, relative evacuation rate increased, whereas feeding rate declined. It is postulated that at higher water temperatures, disassociated feeding and gut-evacuation rates reduce the scope for growth of vertically migrating Mysis and impose a physiological constraint that isolates Mysis from warm, epilimnetic water during thermal stratification.									33	0	0	0	33	0	35			0142-7873			WOS:000077627700010

Climate-mediated change to trophic interactions can have pervasive ecological consequences, but the role of invasion in mediating trophic effects is largely unstudied. Using manipulative experiments in replicated outdoor mesocosms, we reveal how near-future ocean warming and macrophyte invasion scenarios interactively impact gastropod grazing intensity and preference for consumption of foundation macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Sargassum vestitum). Elevated water temperature increased the consumption of both macroalgae through greater grazing intensity. Given the documented decline of kelp (E. radiata) growth at higher water temperatures, enhanced grazing could contribute to the shift from kelp-dominated to Sargassum-dominated reefs that is occurring at the low-latitude margins of kelp distribution. However, the presence of a native invader (Caulerpa filiformis) was related to low consumption by the herbivores on dominant kelp at warmer temperatures. Thus, antagonistic effects between climate change and a range expanding species can favour kelp persistence in a warmer future. Introduction of species should, therefore, not automatically be considered unfavourable under climate change scenarios. Climatic changes are increasing the need for effective management actions to address the interactive effects of multiple stressors and their ecological consequences, rather than single threats in isolation.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0962-8452	1471-2945		WOS:000465434800009	30900532

Quantifying the temperature dependence of consumer-resource interactions is thus essential for predicting ecological responses to warming. We explored feeding interactions between different predator-prey pairs in controlled-temperature chambers and in a system of naturally heated streams. We found consistent temperature dependence of attack rates across experimental settings, though the magnitude and activation energy of attack rate were specific to each predator, which varied in mobility and foraging mode. We used these parameters along with metabolic rate measurements to estimate energetic efficiency and population abundance with warming. Energetic efficiency accurately estimated field abundance of a mobile predator that struggled to meet its metabolic demands, but was a poor predictor for a sedentary predator that operated well below its energetic limits. Temperature effects on population abundance may thus be strongly dependent on whether organisms are regulated by their own energy intake or interspecific interactions. Given the widespread use of functional response parameters in ecological modelling, reconciling outcomes from laboratory and field studies increases the confidence and precision with which we can predict warming impacts on natural systems.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000481017800001	31283002

Higher mean and peak temperatures, together with parasites, might influence the impact of predatory invasive host species additively, synergistically or antagonistically. Here, we apply the comparative functional response methodology (relationship between resource consumption rate and resource supply) in one experiment and conduct a second scaled-up mesocosm experiment to assess any differential predatory impacts of the freshwater invasive amphipod Gammarus pulex, when uninfected and infected with the acanthocephalan Echinorhynchus truttae, at three temperatures representative of current and future climate. Individual G. pulex showed Type II predatory functional responses. In both experiments, infection was associated with higher maximum feeding rates, which also increased with increasing temperatures. Additionally, infection interacted with higher temperatures to synergistically elevate functional responses and feeding rates. Parasitic infection also generally increased Q(10) values. We thus suggest that the differential metabolic responses of the host and parasite to increasing temperatures drives the synergy between infection and temperature, elevating feeding rates and thus enhancing the ecological impact of the invader.

J	South, Josie; Dick, Jaimie T. A.								Effects of acute and chronic temperature changes on the functional responses of the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula (Linnaeus, 1758) towards amphipod prey Echinogammarus marinus (Leach, 1815)								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				100	10			1251	1263		10.1007/s10641-017-0640-z				OCT 2017	2017	Predation is a strong driver of population dynamics and community structure and it is essential to reliably quantify and predict predation impacts on prey populations in a changing thermal landscape. Here, we used comparative functional response analyses to assess how predator-prey interactions between dogfish and invertebrate prey change under different warming scenarios. The Functional Response Type, attack rate, handling time and maximum feeding rate estimates were calculated for Scyliorhinus canicula preying upon Echinogammarus marinus under temperatures of 11.3 degrees C and 16.3 degrees C, which represent both the potential daily variation and predicted higher summer temperatures within Strangford Lough, N. Ireland. A two x two design of "Predator Acclimated", "Prey Acclimated", "Both Acclimated", and "Both Unacclimated" was implemented to test functional responses to temperature rise. Attack rate was higher at 11.3 degrees C than at 16.3 degrees C, but handling time was lower and maximum feeding rates were higher at 16.3 degrees C. Non-acclimated predators had similar maximum feeding rate towards non-acclimated and acclimated prey, whereas acclimated predators had significantly higher maximum feeding rates towards acclimated prey as compared to non-acclimated prey. Results suggests that the predator attack rate is decreased by increasing temperature but when both predator and prey are acclimated the shorter handling times considerably increase predator impact. The functional response of the fish changed from Type II to Type III with an increase in temperature, except when only the prey were acclimated. This change from population destabilizing Type II to more stabilizing Type III could confer protection to prey at low densities but increase the maximum feeding rate by Scyliorhinus canicula in the future. However, predator movement between different thermal regimes may maintain a Type II response, albeit with a lower maximum feeding rate. This has implications for the way the increasing population Scyliorhinus canicula in the Irish Sea may exploit valuable fisheries stocks in the future.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000412840700008

The experiment was carried out in replicated aquatic microcosms with two different water temperatures (control and a 'warming water' scenario). Survival of tadpoles decreased significantly in the treatment compared to the control and at the end of the experiment, all tadpoles in the 'warming water' scenario had been ingested, unlike in the control treatment, where only half of the tadpoles were ingested. Our results demonstrate that the alterations in abiotic conditions (water temperature) can reshape predator-prey dynamics in a future scenario of global warming. The consequent increase of predation may intensify negative effects on population size in anuran larvae. Although changes are likely, they are complex and often counterintuitive.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0165-0521	1744-5140		WOS:000483734600001

The functional response of A. sardea was evaluated in variable density of prey items with variation in search area (100, 250, 500 and 1000 ml water volume) and temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results of laboratory bioassay revealed that prey consumption rate of predator species was positively related with increasing temperature and inversely related with increasing search area. Polynomial logistic regression equations and associated parameters showed that A. sardea exhibited a type II functional response in variable search area and type-III response at variable temperatures. Related response specific attack rates and handling times were also evaluated in presence of specific abiotic factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Lakes are sensitive integrators of climate-induced changes and prominent features across the Arctic landscape, especially in lowland permafrost regions such as the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Despite many studies on the implications of climate warming, how fish populations will respond to lake changes is uncertain for Arctic ecosystems. Least Cisco (Coregonus sardinella) is a bellwether for Arctic lakes as an important consumer and prey resource. To explore the consequences of climate warming, we used a bioenergetics model to simulate changes in Least Cisco production under future climate scenarios for lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain. First, we used current temperatures to fit Least Cisco consumption to observed annual growth. We then estimated growth, holding food availability, and then feeding rate constant, for future projections of temperature. Projected warmer water temperatures resulted in reduced Least Cisco production, especially for larger size classes, when food availability was held constant. While holding feeding rate constant, production of Least Cisco increased under all future scenarios with progressively more growth in warmer temperatures. Higher variability occurred with longer projections of time mirroring the expanding uncertainty in climate predictions further into the future. In addition to direct temperature effects on Least Cisco growth, we also considered changes in lake ice phenology and prey resources for Least Cisco. A shorter period of ice cover resulted in increased production, similar to warming temperatures. Altering prey quality had a larger effect on fish production in summer than winter and increased relative growth of younger rather than older age classes of Least Cisco. Overall, we predicted increased production of Least Cisco due to climate warming in lakes of Arctic Alaska. Understanding the implications of increased production of Least Cisco to the entire food web will be necessary to predict ecosystem responses in lakes of the Arctic.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			2045-7758			WOS:000336491600020	24963391

Climate change effects on forest ecosystems include warming and decreasing litter quality (e. g. higher C : nutrient ratios) induced by higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While litter-bag experiments unravelled separate effects, a mechanistic understanding of how interactions between temperature and litter stoichiometry are driving decomposition rates is lacking. In a laboratory experiment, we filled this void by quantifying decomposer consumption rates analogous to predator-prey functional responses that include the mechanistic parameters handling time and attack rate. Systematically, we varied the body masses of isopods, the environmental temperature and the resource between poor (hornbeam) and good quality (ash). We found that attack rates increased and handling times decreased (i) with body masses and (ii) temperature. Interestingly, these relationships interacted with litter quality: small isopods possibly avoided the poorer resource, whereas large isopods exhibited increased, compensatory feeding of the poorer resource, which may be explained by their higher metabolic demands. The combination of metabolic theory and ecological stoichiometry provided critically important mechanistic insights into how warming and varying litter quality may modify macrofaunal decomposition rates.									35	0	0	0	34	0	36			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000309253400014	23007091

Feeding trials were used to quantify functional feeding response, satiation, and gut evacuation rate. Once parameterized, the foraging model was then applied to evaluate effects of prey type, prey density, water temperature, and fish size on daily feeding rate by age-0 (19-70 mm) pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). Prey consumption was positively related to prey density (for fish > 30 mm) and water temperature, but negatively related to prey size and the presence of sand substrate. Model evaluation results revealed good agreement between observed estimates of daily consumption and those predicted by the model (r(2) = 0.95). Model simulations showed that fish feeding on Chironomidae or Ephemeroptera larvae were able to gain mass, whereas fish feeding solely on zooplankton lost mass under most conditions. By accounting for satiation and digestive processes in addition to handling time and prey density, the model provides realistic estimates of daily food consumption that can prove useful for evaluating rearing conditions for age-0 fishes.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000411897600015

However, the effects of an important trait-predator foraging strategy-are largely unknown. We investigated the interactions between predator foraging strategy and temperature on two ectotherm predators: an active predator, the backswimmerNotonecta undulata, and a sit-and-wait predator, the damselflyEnallagma annexum. In a series of predator-prey experiments across a temperature gradient, we measured predator feeding rates on an active prey species, zooplanktonDaphnia pulex, predator growth rates, and mechanisms that influence predator feeding: body speed of predators and prey (here measured as swimming speed), prey encounter rates, capture success, attack rates, and handling time. Overall, warming led to increased feeding rates for both predators through changes to each component of the predator's functional response. We found that prey swimming speed strongly increased with temperature. The active predator's swimming speed also increased with temperature, and together, the increase in predator and prey swimming speed resulted in twofold higher prey encounter rates for the active predator at warmer temperatures. By contrast, prey encounter rates of the sit-and-wait predator increased fourfold with rising temperatures as a result of increased prey swimming speed. Concurrently, increased prey swimming speed was associated with a decline in the active predator's capture success at high temperatures, whereas the sit-and-wait predator's capture success slightly increased with temperature. We provide some of the first evidence that foraging traits mediate the indirect effects of warming on predator performance. Understanding how traits influence species' responses to warming could clarify how climate change will affect entire functional groups of species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000562303400001	32726861

It is worldwide in distribution and primarily managed through typical dependence on insecticides, which resulted in health and the environmental challenges and selected for resistance development inS. liturafield populations. Resistance caused chemical control failures andS. lituraoutbreaks around the world. This necessitated development of eco-friendly alternative approaches such as biological control. With this view, current study investigated the functional response ofHarmonia axyridis(Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) at various growth stages (i.e., 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instars, and male and female stages) and temperatures (i.e., 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) againstS. lituraeggs to enable the recognition of efficient biocontrol stages that could be utilized to suppressS. liturapopulations. In our findings, egg consumption depended on the growth stage of the predator as well as temperature. All stages consumedS. lituraeggs, but more promising stages with active egg consumption were the 4th instar and adults (male and female) typically at higher temperatures (25-35 degrees C). We conclude that these stages may be exploited to suppressS. liturapopulations in fields and greenhouses. Spodoptera litura(Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a major pest of several economically important crops with worldwide distribution. Use of insecticides is the principal strategy for its management, which has subsequently led to insecticide resistance and control failures. Functional response ofHarmonia axyridis(Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) at larval and adult stages was evaluated in this study, usingS. lituraeggs as the prey at various temperatures varying between 15 and 35 degrees C. Based on logistic model findings, linear parameters of various predatory stages ofH. axyridisat various temperatures were significantly negative, which indicate a type II functional response. The theoretical maximum number (T/T-h) of eggs consumed increased with increasing temperature across all predatory stages. According to the random predator equation, the coefficients of attack rate increased and that of handling time decreased as the temperature increased. The 4th instar and adult stages were superior candidates for biocontrol of the target prey, typically at higher temperatures. The maximum attack rate (0.546 +/- 0.058 h(-1)) and lowest handling time (0.189 +/- 0.004 h) were exhibited by the females at 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively, whereas these parameters were inferior for early instars. These findings clearly depict that the 4th instar and adult predators are efficient egg consumers and can serve as potential suppressors ofS. liturafield populations. The limitations of the predictions formulated by functional response trials are also discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2075-4450		WOS:000580385000001	32882812

For the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus, attacking and consuming Mytilus edulis mussels can take hours or days, depending on temperature. Handling time of dogwhelks feeding on mussels is therefore greatly affected by ocean temperature. I recorded attack time in the laboratory, partitioned into drilling and consumption time, for juvenile dogwhelks across a range of seawater temperatures representative of field seawater temperatures during the main growing seasons of summer and autumn. The combined length of a drilling attack and subsequent ingestion time tripled across the 10 A degrees C decline in water temperatures from July through November, driven primarily by an increase in ingestion time. The observed reduction in handling time, coupled with projected sea surface warming in New England by the end of the twenty-first century, could extend the length of the growing season for Nucella and subsequently have cascading effects on the prey community.									18	0	0	0	16	0	18			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000319360100017

Consumer-Resource interactions in particular can be strongly impacted by changes to the relative performance of interacting species. While consumers generally gain an advantage over their resources with increasing temperatures, nonlinearities can change this relation near temperature extremes. We use an experimental approach to determine how temperature changes between 5 and 30 degrees C will alter the growth of the algae Scenedesmus obliquus and the functional responses of the small-bodied Daphnia ambigua and the larger Daphnia pulicaria. The impact of warming generally followed expectations, making both Daphnia species more effective grazers, with the increase in feeding rates outpacing the increases in algal growth rate. At the extremes of our temperature range, however, warming resulted in a decrease in Daphnia grazing effectiveness. Between 25 and 30 degrees C, both species of Daphnia experienced a precipitous drop in feeding rates, while algal growth rates remained high, increasing the likelihood of algal blooms in warming summer temperatures.Daphnia pulicaria performed significantly better at cold temperatures than D.ambigua, but by 20 degrees C, there was no significant difference between the two species, and at 25 degrees C, D.ambigua outperformed D.pulicaria. Warming summer temperatures will favour the smaller D.ambigua, but only over a narrow temperature range, and warming beyond 25 degrees C could open D.ambigua to invasion from tropical species. By fitting our results to temperature-dependent functions, we develop a temperature- and density-dependent model, which produces a metric of grazing effectiveness, quantifying the grazer density necessary to halt algal growth. This approach should prove useful for tracking the transient dynamics of other density-dependent consumer-resource interactions, such as agricultural pests and biological-control agents.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000375121400009	26781835

Opposite responses by an intertidal predator to increasing aquatic and aerial temperatures								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				393				27	36		10.3354/meps08276				2009	2009	Predicting the effects of climate change on ecosystems requires an understanding of how temperature alters organismal physiology and behavior, Because predation can shape patterns of abundance and diversity across a community, it is critical to understand the effect of temperature on predator behavior. Climate change in intertidal systems will comprise changes in both air and water temperatures, yet most previous marine intertidal studies have focused on either air or water temperature alone. In a 20 d laboratory study, we examined the effect of changing emersed and submersed body temperatures on the feeding and growth rates of Nucella ostrina, a common northeastern Pacific intertidal gastropod that feeds primarily on the barnacle Balanus glandula. Our results revealed a large increase in both predation and growth rates with higher submersion temperatures (13.5 degrees C compared with 11 degrees C). In contrast, we observed a large decrease in the feeding and growth of N. ostrina exposed to the highest emersed body temperature (28 degrees C) when compared with intermediate (20 degrees C) and cooler (12 degrees C) aerial temperatures. Thus, while B. glandula may suffer greater predation-related mortality in warmer water temperatures, it may actually experience a release from predation if air temperatures warm. Our study points to the importance of considering temperatures reached during both submersion and emersion separately, and examining behavioral responses in light of physiologically relevant temperatures and thermal regimes.									41	0	0	0	40	0	41			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000272187800003

The effects of increased temperatures on bivalves has been well examined through single-species studies, showing reductions in tissue mass, shell growth, oxygen uptake, feeding rates, and survival. However, the consequences of these effects on predator-prey interactions remain poorly understood. We examined how increased temperatures (30, 32, 34 degrees C) and the presence of water-borne predation cues from blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) affected the morphology and growth rate of southern ribbed mussels (Geukensia granosissima), as well as their handling times when attacked by predatory crabs. Although southern ribbed mussels were able to survive under chronic heat stress, exposure to higher temperatures resulted in more elongated shell shapes. Growth rates in mussel wet weight were higher for mussels reared in the presence of a predator than in the predator-free control, but only in the low-temperature treatment. Likewise, handling times were greater for crabs eating mussels grown in the presence of a predator, but the effect was lost at the mid- and high-temperature treatments. These findings suggest that predation-induced defenses were suppressed when prey were under chronic thermal stress, which could make mussels more vulnerable to predation. The presence of predation cues in natural environments should be taken in consideration when estimating or predicting the effects of climate change on organisms.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000435855700001

Recent studies focusing on the consequences of environmental change on species interactions highlighted the need for a wider, multi-species context including both trophic and non-trophic interactions (e.g. predator interference). However, the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on trophic and non-trophic interactions remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we combined laboratory experiments and functional response modelling to investigate how temperature and prey density influence trophic and non-trophic interactions in multiple predator communities. The system under study consisted of predatory dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea) and omnivorous marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) preying on common carp fry (Cyprinus carpio). We estimated the functional response of each predator in single-predator experiments and used this information to disentangle the trophic and non-trophic interactions and their dependence on environmental conditions in multiple predator trials. We found that consumer identity, prey density, and temperature all affect the magnitude of trophic and non-trophic interactions. Non-trophic interactions mostly decreased predator feeding rates, corroborating previous observations that interference prevails in aquatic communities. Moreover, trophic interactions depended primarily on the environmental variables whereas non-trophic interactions depended mainly on consumer identity. Our results indicate that non-trophic interactions among true predators and omnivores can be substantial and that biotic and abiotic conditions further modify the magnitude and direction of these interactions, which can affect food web dynamics and stability.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000490904700008

Effects of changing light and temperature on one food-web component transfer to other components, producing a complex interplay between physical drivers and biotic feedbacks. Understanding this interplay is important, because altered climate regimes could result in phenological mismatch between the phytoplankton spring bloom and the timing of maximum food requirements of grazers. To separate direct effects of light and temperature on spring plankton dynamics from effects mediated through micro- and mesograzer feedbacks, we manipulated water temperature, stratification depth and presence/absence of the mesograzer Daphnia in lake mesocosms. In early spring, stratification depth and water temperature directly influenced the light supply to phytoplankton and the growth rates of all plankton groups. Subsequently, indirect effects, including light-dependent food supply to grazers and temperature-dependent grazing pressure, became increasingly important. Phytoplankton and Daphnia peaked earlier in warmer treatments and reached higher peaks when stratification depth was shallower. Ciliates responded positively to increased food density and higher temperature and subsequently affected the taxonomic composition, but not the total biomass, of phytoplankton. In the absence of Daphnia, phytoplankton did not enter a distinct clear water phase. When present, Daphnia caused an extended clear water phase, maintaining phytoplankton and ciliates at low levels throughout early summer and suppressing all direct effects of physical drivers on these plankton groups. Our Daphnia treatments mimicked the high and low fish predation settings of the largely descriptive, recently revised Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model of seasonal plankton succession and explored their responses to climate change scenarios. The results largely support the PEG model, but attribute greater importance to early season temperature effects and later season grazing effects of Daphnia. In warmer treatments, the timing of phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks tended to be more closely coupled, and temperature did not affect the height of zooplankton peaks. In line with other experiments, these results do not support the widely held concern that warming may create a trophic mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton and reduce spring zooplankton production.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000342758300016

Here, we have examined if increased temperature reduces the hypoxia tolerance of coral reef fish (measured as critical [O-2]), and if temperature acclimation in adults can change the resting rate of O-2 consumption and critical [O-2]. Two common species from Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) were tested, Doederlein's cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus doederleini) and lemon damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis). In both species, a 3 degrees C rise in water temperature caused increased oxygen consumption and reduced hypoxia tolerance, changes that were not reduced by acclimation to the higher temperature for 7 to 22 days. Critical [O-2] increased by 71% in the cardinalfish and by 23% in the damselfish at 32 degrees C compared to 29 degrees C. The higher oxygen needs are likely to reduce the aerobic scope, which could negatively affect the capacity for feeding, growth and reproduction. The reduced hypoxia tolerance may force the fishes out of their nocturnal shelters in the coral matrix, exposing them to predation. The consequences for population and species survival could be severe unless developmental phenotypic plasticity within generations or genetic adaptation between generations could produce individuals that are more tolerant to a warmer future.

There is a concern that climate change is exacerbating this problem. Here, we examined some of the potential effects of warming water temperatures on the invasion of Western Atlantic habitats by a marine predator, the Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles). We focussed on two temperature-dependent aspects of lionfish life-history and behaviour: pelagic larval duration, because of its link to dispersal potential, and prey consumption rate, because it is an important determinant of the impacts of lionfish on native prey. Using models derived from fundamental metabolic theory, we predict that the length of time spent by lionfish in the plankton in early life should decrease with warming temperatures, with a concomitant reduction in potential dispersal distance. Although the uncertainty around change in dispersal distances is large, predicted reductions are, on average, more than an order of magnitude smaller than the current rate of range expansion of lionfish in the Caribbean. Nevertheless, because shorter pelagic larval duration has the potential to increase local retention of larvae, local lionfish management will become increasingly important under projected climate change. Increasing temperature is also expected to worsen the current imbalance between rates of prey consumption by lionfish and biomass production by their prey, leading to a heightened decline in native reef fish biomass. However, the magnitude of climate-induced decline is predicted to be minor compared to the effect of current rates of lionfish population increases (and hence overall prey consumption rates) on invaded reefs. Placing the predicted effects of climate change in the current context thus reveals that, at least for the lionfish invasion, the threat is clear and present, rather than future [Current Zoology 58 (1): 1-8, 2012].									24	1	0	0	25	2	27			1674-5507	2396-9814		WOS:000299204400002

Both species exert a detrimental effect on fish community structure directly via predation on fish eggs and indirectly via alterations of food webs. While the impact of N. melanostomus is widely documented, P. semilunaris receives little attention and its effect on aquatic communities has not yet been quantified. We compared aspects of their predation on common carp Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758 larvae at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C using the functional response (FR) approach, which has been developed and applied to forecast invader impact. Intra-specific comparison showed no significant temperature dependency on assessed FR parameters, attack rate and handling time, suggesting broad temperature tolerance of both tested predators. Proterorhinus semilunaris demonstrated a marginally higher attack rate at 20 degrees C compared to N. melanostomus. The handling times did not differ between predators. Proterorhinus semilunaris showed a lower maximum feeding rate at 25 degrees C compared to the rest of treatments suggesting lower temperature optima compared to N. melanostomus. Both predators showed substantial maximum feeding rates, which may impact recruitment of native fish species.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1798-6540	1818-5487		WOS:000433177000009

(Homoptera : Delphacidae)								RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY				39	2			201	206		10.1007/BF02765266				DEC 1997	1997	The functional response of Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter attacking the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stal.), BPH) eggs on rice was determined at six constant temperatures of 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 29 degrees C, 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Rogers' (1972) random predator equations were fitted to the data for each temperature separately. The equation model adequately described a Holling's Type II functional response for C. lividipennis and produced biologically realistic estimates of attack rates and handling times at five experimental temperatures between 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C. However, at 35 degrees C, a negative handling time (Th = -0.0029) was produced. The effect of temperature was incorporated into Rogers' equation by making the attack rate (a) and handling time (Th) functions of temperature within the range 20 degrees C to 32 degrees C. The attack rate and handling time were fitted as hyperbola and reciprocal hyperbola functions of temperature respectively. The temperature incorporating four-parameter composite model fitted the combined data as well as did separate Rogers' equations based on the parameter estimates.									15	3	0	0	15	0	17			0034-5466			WOS:000073655900012

Consumption by the rainbow trout population was at least 10 times higher than by the smaller humpback chub population. Water temperature increases of 6 degrees C during autumn increased growth of humpback chub and likely increased their survival by reducing the time vulnerable to predation. Water temperature increases caused by drought in 2005 did not alter humpback chub growth as much as the SWS. Increased temperatures might cause changes to the invertebrate community and the distribution and abundance of other warmwater nonnative fishes. The implications on the entire aquatic community need to be considered before any management action that includes increasing water temperatures is implemented.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0038-4909	1943-6262		WOS:000247606900006

Here I ask how can Allee effects, occurring when mean individual fitness is reduced in rare populations, respond to increasing temperature. Despite the role Allee effects play in ecology of invasive, threatened and harvested populations, impacts of climate change on Allee effects are practically unknown. Analysis of two population models reveals that whereas the Allee effect driven by predation generally weakens as temperature increases, the Allee effect due to need of finding mates is predicted to become stronger when warming occurs. For the former model, the metabolic theory suggests that with increasing temperature prey growth rate should increase faster than predator attack rate. Increasing temperature thus weakens the Allee effect. In the latter, gypsy moth population model, mating rate increases with warming due to enhanced female-male encounter rate and temperature-induced modifications in female and male adult emergence distributions. However, male and female mortality rates increase, too and the net effect is strengthening of the Allee effect. These results have repercussions also for pest control, indicating that augmentation of biocontrol agents may perhaps be not as effective as using pesticides or disrupting mating.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000474370800006

(Coleoptera:Coccinellidae)								PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				42	4			461	466						AUG 2010	2010	The foraging activities of the predators depend, on environmental variables, including air temperature. In the present study, the searching behavior and maximum consumption of prey of all developmental stages of Coccinella septempunctata was carried out with respect to the changing values of the air temperature. A strong relationship between two important factors of functional response "instantaneous attack rate" (a') and "prey handling time" (T-h) was found with respect to temperature changes. The prey intake ratio per unit time was increased with increasing temperature up to a certain level beyond which it levels off and goes down to the extent of '0'predation. The temperature range for the foraging activities falls between 10 degrees C-40 degrees C. However, maximum predation rates were observed between 20-23 degrees C and 23 degrees C-25 degrees C. The lower temperature where the foraging activities were completely ceased was between 10-12 degrees C irrespective of prey densities available. A parabolic (curvilinear) relationship with high scale of co-relation (r(2) (=) 0.86-0.99 alpha = 0.01) (T-h) was found.									7	1	0	0	8	0	8			0030-9923			WOS:000278433800016

Temperature-dependent effects on predator-prey interactions are a major mechanism through which these effects occur. To understand the net effects of predator attack rates and dynamic windows of prey vulnerability, we examined the impacts of temperature on the interaction of a caterpillar (Arctia virginalis) and its ant predator (Formica lasioides). We conducted field experiments to examine attack rates on caterpillars relative to temperature, ant abundance, and body size, and laboratory experiments to determine the effects of temperature on caterpillar growth. We modeled temperature-dependent survival based on the integrated effects of temperature-dependent growth and temperature- and size-dependent predation. Attack rates on caterpillars increased with warming and ant recruitment, but decreased with caterpillar size. Caterpillar growth rates increased with temperature, narrowing the window of vulnerability. The model predicted that net caterpillar survival would decrease with temperature, suggesting that A. virginalis populations could be depressed with future climate warming. Theoretical work suggests that the net outcome of predator-prey interactions with increasing temperature depends on the respective responses of interacting species in terms of velocity across space, whereas the present study suggests the importance of effects of temperature on prey window of vulnerability, or "velocity" across time.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000436869900008	29672837

In marine environments, multiple climate variables, including temperature and CO2 concentration ([CO2]), are changing simultaneously. Although temperature has well-documented ecological effects, and many heavily calcified marine organisms experience reduced growth with increased [CO2], little is known about the combined effects of temperature and [CO2], particularly on species that are less dependent on calcified shells or skeletons. We manipulated water temperature and [CO2] to determine the effects on the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, a keystone predator. We found that sea star growth and feeding rates increased with water temperature from 5 degrees C to 21 degrees C. A doubling of current [CO2] also increased growth rates both with and without a concurrent temperature increase from 12 degrees C to 15 degrees C. Increased [CO2] also had a positive but nonsignificant effect on sea star feeding rates, suggesting [CO2] may be acting directly at the physiological level to increase growth rates. As in past studies of other marine invertebrates, increased [CO2] reduced the relative calcified mass in sea stars, although this effect was observed only at the lower experimental temperature. The positive relationship between growth and [CO2] found here contrasts with previous studies, most of which have shown negative effects of [CO2] on marine species, particularly those that are more heavily calcified than P. ochraceus. Our findings demonstrate that increased [CO2] will not have direct negative effects on all marine invertebrates, suggesting that predictions of biotic responses to climate change should consider how different types of organisms will respond to changing climatic variables.									165	4	0	0	148	0	167			0027-8424			WOS:000266817500039	19470464

To examine the relevance of this equation, we undertook a meta-analysis of published relationships between functional response parameters and temperature. We show that, when plotted in lin-log space, temperature dependence of both attack rate and maximal ingestion rate exhibits a hump-shaped relationship and not a linear one as predicted by the Arrhenius equation. The relationship remains significantly downward concave even when data from temperatures above the peak of the hump are discarded. Temperature dependence is stronger for attack rate than for maximal ingestion rate, but the thermal optima are not different. We conclude that the use of the Arrhenius equation to describe consumption in predator-prey models requires the assumption that temperatures above thermal optima are unimportant for population and community dynamics, an assumption that is untenable given the available data.									198	2	0	0	182	1	197			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000293628300011	21752171

Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, 'fright' bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28 degrees C, and 'high' climate warming, 34 degrees C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34 degrees C (Q(10)=7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9 +/- 27.8% and 27.8 +/- 16.5% (means +/- s.e.m.) at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive. Together these findings suggest decrements in fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures stem from increased oxygen demand coupled with a reduced capacity for metabolic depression.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000412240500025	28978640

Several robust patterns arise. The relationship between prey carrying capacity and temperature can range from near-independence to monotonically declining/increasing to hump-shaped. Predators persist in a U-shaped region in resource supply (=enrichment)-temperature space. Type II responses yield stable persistence in a U-shaped band inside this region, giving way to limit cycles with enrichment at all temperatures. In contrast, type III responses convey stability at intermediate temperatures and confine cycles to low and high temperatures. Warming-induced state shifts can be predicted from system trajectories crossing stability and persistence boundaries in enrichment-temperature space. Results of earlier studies with more restricted assumptions map onto this graph as special cases. Our approach thus provides a unifying framework for understanding warming effects on trophic dynamics.									42	0	0	0	33	0	40			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000397100900013	28266168

We examined the effect of temperature on the functional responses of Neoseiulus womersleyi and N. longispinosus on eggs of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Logistic regression indicated that both N. womersleyi and N. longispinosus exhibited type II functional responses on prey eggs, regardless of temperature. The attack rate coefficient of N. womersleyi increased with temperature from 15 to 30 degrees C and declined at 35 degrees C, whereas that of N. longispinosus peaked at 20 degrees C and then decreased with increasing temperature. The attack rate was higher in N. womersleyi than in N. longispinosus at 30 and 35 degrees C. The handling time of both species declined exponentially with temperature increase from 15 to 35 degrees C. At all temperatures, the handling time of N. longispinosus was shorter than that of N. womersleyi. The number of eggs laid by N. womersleyi and N. longispinosus was significantly influenced by temperature and prey density. The efficiency of converting ingested food into egg biomass (ECI) was higher at lower prey densities and reduced at higher prey densities at each temperature; this is consistent with a type II functional response in which females invested in their own maintenance after reaching a maximum rate of oviposition. The temperature-mediated ECI model indicated that the coefficient differed between the two species at 30 and 35 degrees C. Finally, the implications of the interactions of temperature, prey and predator should be considered for development of suitable biocontrol strategies for spider mites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000443831000004

In the laboratory, oyster drill feeding rates and growth were highest at 25 and 30degreesC, some mortality occurred at 35degreesC, all snails died at 40 and 45degreesC, and the 28-day LC50 was 35.7degreesC. In a second experiment where both water temperature (25 vs . 33degreesC) and aerial exposure were varied, only simulated tidal exposure lowered oyster drill feeding and growth rates. In field cage experiments, oyster drills had reduced feeding rates and growth at intertidal sites, but snail growth rates increased in late summer with warmer water temperature. We therefore conclude that aerial exposure, not high temperature, is the major factor limiting oyster drill feeding and growth in intertidal oyster reefs. Field experiments with partial cages also suggested that ambient predation rates were much higher at a subtidal than at a nearby intertidal site. Because southern oyster drills have depressed feeding, growth, and possibly lower fitness in intertidal oyster reefs during the summer, this reduced predation risk may provide a refuge for intertidal oysters.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0091-181X			WOS:000177310400004

This study examined the effect of temperature on the functional response of anacarophagous thrips Scolothrips longicornis Priesner to different densities of two spotted spider mite, Tetranychusurticae Koch in laboratory conditions. Five constant temperatures (15, 20, 26, 30, and 35 Â°C) and sevenprey densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) were used in the experiments. At each temperature, 2 to 128 adultof T. urticaue were exposed to a female S. longicornis for a 24 h period. The results indicated that thepredatory thrips exhibited type II functional response to different densities of T. urticae at all examinedtemperatures. Temperature had significant effect on the predation capacity of the adult thrips over the rangeof 15–35 Â°C. Instantaneous attack rate (a) of the predator increased linearly with increasing temperature from15 to 35 Â°C. At 35 Â°C, the highest instantaneous attack rate was estimated to be 0.0579 day1 using the Hollingmodel and 0.1480 day1 using Rogers model. The estimated value of handling time (Th) using both Hollingand Rogers models decreased linearly with increasing temperature from 15 to 35 Â°C. Scolothrips longicornisachieved higher predation at higher temperature (16.1 preys/day at 35 Â°C). This observation suggested that S.longicornis may be more effective for biological control of two spotted spider mite in warmer conditions.									19	4	0	0	21	1	26			1226-8615			KJD:ART001321212

The functional response of E. annulipes to P. xylostella was temperature-dependent, type III under the lower temperatur (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), and type II at 32 degrees C. We observed increasing values of a' in 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, decreasing values of Th and highest T/T-h as the thermal condition increased. Our findings suggest that E. annulipes could be effective to control P. xylostella under different thermal conditions, however its predation behavior changes according to temperature variation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000579864500008	33077112	
J	Walker, Ryan; Wilder, Shawn M.; Gonzalez, Angelica L.					Gonzalez, Angelica L./0000-0002-4636-6329			Temperature dependency of predation: Increased killing rates and prey mass consumption by predators with warming								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				10	18			9696	9706		10.1002/ece3.6581		AUG 2020		SEP 2020	2020	Temperature dependency of consumer-resource interactions is fundamentally important for understanding and predicting the responses of food webs to climate change. Previous studies have shown temperature-driven shifts in herbivore consumption rates and resource preference, but these effects remain poorly understood for predatory arthropods. Here, we investigate how predator killing rates, prey mass consumption, and macronutrient intake respond to increased temperatures using a laboratory and a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Ectothermic predators, wolf spiders (Pardosa sp.), in the lab experiment, were exposed to increased temperatures and different prey macronutrient content (high lipid/low protein and low lipid/high protein) to assess changes in their killing rates and nutritional demands. Additionally, we investigate prey mass and lipid consumption by spiders under contrasting temperatures, along an elevation gradient. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment between low (420 masl; 26 degrees C) and high (2,100 masl; 15 degrees C) elevations in the Ecuadorian Andes, using wild populations of two common orb-weaver spider species (Leucauge sp. and Cyclosa sp.) present along the elevation gradient. We found that killing rates of wolf spiders increased with warmer temperatures but were not significantly affected by prey macronutrient content, although spiders consumed significantly more lipids from lipid-rich prey. The field reciprocal transplant experiment showed no consistent predator responses to changes in temperature along the elevational gradient. Transplanting Cyclosa sp. spiders to low- or high-elevation sites did not affect their prey mass or lipid consumption rate, whereas Leucauge sp. individuals increased prey mass consumption when transplanted from the high to the low warm elevation. Our findings show that increases in temperature intensify predator killing rates, prey consumption, and lipid intake, but the responses to temperature vary between species, which may be a result of species-specific differences in their hunting behavior and sensitivity to temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000561181800001	33005340

One hypothesis is that interactions will respond non-monotonically to temperature because thermal performance curves, which determine the strength of these interactions, are also non-monotonic. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a temperature-dependent consumer-resource model and tested predictions from this model in large freshwater mesocosms populated with green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia magna). We found both in the model simulations and empirical investigations that the suppressive effect of the consumer depended non-monotonically on the temperature. As predicted by the model, Daphnia suppressed the algal maximum per capita growth rate at the temperature that maximized algal growth rate but had little effect on resource growth at either lower or higher temperatures. This finding could help explain why effects of temperature variation on species interaction are variable in the literature and suggests that predicting the effects of temperature on the strength of food web interactions requires knowledge of the thermal performance curves for multiple traits, for multiple species and over a range of temperatures.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2150-8925			WOS:000483832300005

While there is a body of evidence of the former, we lack experimental evidence on potential changes in interaction strengths. Knowledge about multispecies interactions is fundamental to understand the regulation of biodiversity and the impact of climate change on communities. This study investigated the effect of warming on a simplified community consisting of three species: rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea feeding on plantain, Plantago lanceolata, and a heterospecific neighbouring plant species, perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne. The aphid does not feed on L. perenne. The experimental design consisted of monocultures and mixtures of L. perenne and P. lanceolata at three temperature levels. We did not find indication for indirect temperature effects on D. plantaginea through changes in leaf nitrogen or relative water content. However, experimental warming affected the life history traits of the aphid directly, in a non-linear manner. Aphids performed best at moderate warming, where they grew faster and had a shorter generation time. In spite of the increased population growth of the aphids under warming, the herbivory rates were not changed and consequently the plant-herbivore interaction was not altered under warming. This suggests reduced consumption rates at higher temperature. Also plant competition affected the aphids but through an interaction with temperature. We provide proof-of-concept that net interactions between plants and herbivores should not change under warming despite direct effects of warming on herbivores when plant-plant interaction are considered. Our study stresses the importance of indirect non-trophic interactions as an additional layer of complexity to improve our understanding of how trophic interactions will alter under climate change.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000394655600007

Daily growth estimates from the mechanistic model were 239% higher than estimates from the standard model at temperatures greater than or equal to 12 degrees C, and 42% lower at temperatures less than or equal to 8 degrees C. The mechanistic model was then modified by incorporating a different respiration function and a new size-and temperature-dependent functional response. Although sensitive to prey and predator size, prey handling time, and feeding duration, results from the modified model were comparable with those from the standard model. Using observed vertical profiles of temperature and prey densities, model growth estimates for kokanee from Blue Mesa Reservoir, Colorado, bounded observed growth under realistic ranges of model parameters. The model also made the following four predictions: seasonal and annual ontogenetic shifts in (i) foraging and (ii) migration strategies; (iii) very low prey handling times (0.33 s.Daphnia(-1)) for larger fish, suggesting that kokanee may be capable of gulp or filter feeding; and (iv) higher daily maximum consumption rates for smaller kokanee than previously hypothesized. The revised model provides a mechanistic means to forecast anthropogenic and climatic thermal effects on fish behavior and growth.									32	0	0	0	29	0	34			0706-652X			WOS:000072050700019

In both species, predation capacity was a function of temperature and prey density: more prey were captured as temperature and number of prey offered increased. Results indicated that type II and III functional responses provided the best fit to the data obtained for P. nigrispinus at 18 and 23 degreesC, and at 27 degreesC, respectively. However, the data for P. maculiventris showed a better fit to type II at 18 degreesC and to type III at higher temperatures. Tn both pentatomids the handling time decreased with increasing temperature. At higher temperatures, P. nigrispinus demonstrated greater predation rates than P. maculiventris. The implications of these findings for the control of caterpillar pests in glasshouses are discussed.									81	12	0	0	92	5	108			0931-2048			WOS:000168945500006

In this study we used the Lessepsian mussel Brachidontes pharaonis, one of the most recent invaders of the Mediterranean Sea, as a model to investigate the effect of a novel prey and a chronic increase in temperatures on functional parameters of local consumers, compared to the native mytilid species Mytilaster minimus. In particular we focused on the whelk Stramonita haemastoma, a widespread Mediterranean intertidal predator that actively preys on bivalves, barnacles and limpets, by studying the direct effects of such multiple stressors on feeding and growth rate, projected into a future climate change scenario (RCP8.5) relative to 2046-2065 with higher hypothesized temperatures of 2 degrees C. Gastropods showed a significantly higher feeding rate (ADFR) on M. minimus at high (6.45 +/- 0.43) vs low temperatures (5.15 +/- 0.33) compared to B. pharaonis (2.84 +/- 0.37 vs 2.48 +/- 0.27). Ingestion rate (ADIR), however, recorded higher values for B. pharaonis at high (1.71 +/- 0.22) and low (1.49 +/- 0.16) temperatures, compared to M. minimus (0.17 +/- 0.01 vs 0.14 +/- 0.01). Prey significantly influenced growth rate, condition index and the length-weight relationship (LWR) of whelks, while only ADFR seemed to be influenced by higher temperatures. In conclusion the extra amount of energy from the novel prey, together with temperature side effects, successfully influenced growth rates and reproductive events, positively affecting the global fitness of whelks.

Here, we examine how predator and prey body size affects the functional response of a generalist predator-damselfly nymphs-feeding on three prey types: copepods, Daphnia, and Chydorus. Our results suggest that consumption of copepods is independent of predator body size, while increased predator body size is associated with an increased space clearance rate for Daphnia and a reduced space clearance rate for Chydorus. When considered together, foraging rates on Daphnia and Chydorus (both cladocerans) are consistent with a hump-shaped functional response, with peak foraging rates occurring at an intermediate predator-prey size ratio. Thus, although most food web theory assumes allometric predator-prey links or peaked functional responses at intermediate predator-prey size ratios, our results suggest that both relationships may occur in food webs, in addition to size-independent functional responses.									12	0	0	0	11	0	11			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000413691100002	28936547

A type II functional response was obtained at all temperatures tested (5-25 degrees C). Handling time was negatively correlated with temperature across the entire range investigated; attack rate increased with temperature to a maximum at 20 degrees C. The relationships between temperature and prey density and the behavioural subcomponents of attack rate were also investigated. Encounter rates with individual prey were significantly greater at law prey densities and high temperatures. The frequency of reactive encounters was significantly greater at higher temperatures but was unrelated to prey density; a similar trend was apparent for attack frequency.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			1326-6756			WOS:000077514100005

Biological control agent selection under environmental change using functional responses, abundances and fecundities; the Relative Control Potential (RCP) metric								BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				121				50	57		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.02.008				JUN 2018	2018	We currently lack the capacity to rapidly and reliably predict the efficacy of biological control agents due to inadequate consistency in derivations of functional and numerical responses and potential effects of context-dependencies. Here, we propose and apply a novel metric, Relative Control Potential (RCP), which combines the functional response (FR, per capita effect) with proxies for the numerical response (NR, agent population response) to compare agent efficacies, where RCP = FR x abundance (or other proxies e.g. fecundity). The RCP metric is a comparative ratio between potential biocontrol agents, where values > 1 indicate higher relative control efficacy. Further, RCP can compare the efficacy of agents under environmental contexts, such as temperature change. We thus derived the RCP for two predatory cyclopoid copepods, Macrocyclops albidus (Cyclopoida: Cyclopidae) and Megacyclops viridis (Cyclopoida: Cyclopidae), towards larvae of the mosquito Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) under temperatures representative of current and future climate. Both copepods exhibited potentially population destabilising Type II FRs, with increasing temperatures inducing greater magnitude FRs through increased attack rates and decreased handling times. Attack rates by M. albidus were higher than M. viridis, yet handling times and maximum feeding rates were similar between the species across all temperatures. The inclusion of abundance data drives an elevated RCP of M. albidus and the integration of fecundity drives greater RCP of M. albidus at peak temperatures. Q(10) values are indicative of increased feeding activity by both copepods with temperature increases, however relative feeding level increases of M. viridis slowed towards the peak temperature. We present RCP calculations and biplots that represent the comparative efficacies of the two biological control agents across temperatures. The Relative Control Potential (RCP) metric thus provides a new tool for practitioners to better assess the potential efficacy of biocontrol agents before their integration into management approaches for pests, vectors and invasive species.									37	0	0	0	36	0	37			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000429777100008

We explored whether environmental differences, in this case the trichome densities of abaxial leaf surfaces of strawberry cultivars ('Maehyang' and 'Sulhyang' varieties) affect the functional response of adult female N. californicus preying on immature stages (egg, larva and nymph) of T. urticae. We also evaluated the functional response of N. californicus to eggs of T. urticae at different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C). We conducted a logistic regression of the proportion of prey consumed as a function of initial prey density to identify functional response types, and used nonlinear least-squares regression and the random predator equation to estimate attack rates and handling times. The functional response of adult female N. californicus to T. urticae was not influenced by non-glandular trichomes on abaxial leaves but was affected by temperature. Overall, adult female N. californicus exhibited a type 2 functional response to T. urticae. The handling time of N. californicus was highest (1.9970 h) against T. urticae nymphs. The attack rate did not change much at 15-30 degrees C, but was significantly higher at 35 degrees C. The handling time decreased significantly with increasing temperature at 15-35 degrees C. At 35 degrees C, the attack rate was highest (0.2087) and the handling time was lowest (0.9511 h).									36	11	0	0	37	1	49			0931-2048	1439-0418		WOS:000274411800003

Our study was carried out in Deroua Fish farm hatchery (Fkih Ben Salah, Morocco) to assess the effect of climate change effects on predation activity and growth of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides. It was conducted in six circular tanks (1.5m(3)) each one receives five specimens of largemouth bass with a weight ranging from 64g to 185g. To carry out this experience we choose two different ranges of water temperature. The first range was water natural temperature; the second range was thermo-regulated by using an electric heating system. The largemouth daily consumption of prey is 5.1% per day of its fresh weight at a temperature range of 16-18 degrees C and 8.7% per day of its fresh weight at a temperature range of 21-24 degrees C. The duration consumption of the same quantity of prey at the temperature range of 21-24 degrees C it is twice more than at a temperature range of 16-18 degrees C but the daily mean growth rate of largemouth bass at a temperature range of 16-18 degrees C is 0.935g/day, while it reaches 2.11g/day at a temperature range of 21-24 degrees C. Fish farm approach following the waters variations demonstrated an increase of the amount of final product of largemouth bass, highlighting the prediction of long-term specie-specific responses to climate change.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2079-052X	2079-0538		WOS:000442375900010

Yet, accurately determining the functional response for any given pair of predator and prey remains a challenge. Moreover, functional responses are potentially complex surfaces in multidimensional space, where resource density is only one of several factors determining consumption rates. We explored how three sources of error can be addressed in the design and statistical analysis of functional response experiments: ill-chosen spacing of prey densities, heteroscedastic variance in consumption rates, and non-independence of parameters of the function describing prey consumption in relation to prey density and additional environmental factors. We generated extensive, virtual data sets that simulated feeding experiments in which both prey density and environmental temperature were varied, and for which the true, deterministic functional response surface was known and realistic variance had been added. We compared eight different methods of functional response fitting, one of which stood out as best performing. We subsequently tested several conclusions from the simulation study against experimental data of zooplankton feeding on algae across a broad range of temperatures. We summarize our main findings in three best practice guidelines for the experimental estimation of functional response surfaces, of which the second is the most important: (1) space prey densities logarithmically, starting from very low densities; (2) log-transform prey consumption data prior to fitting; and (3) fit a multivariate functional response surface to all data (including all prey densities and other factors, in our case temperature) in a single step. We also observed that functional response surfaces were fitted more accurately and precisely than their component parameters. The latter occurred because parameter estimates were non-independent, which is an inevitable feature of fitting complex nonlinear functions to data: A given response surface can often be described with near-equal accuracy by multiple parameter combinations. We therefore conclude that fitted functional response models perform better at optimizing the fit of the overall response surface than at determining how component parameters, such as the attack rate or handling time, depend on environmental factors such as temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2150-8925			WOS:000536583400024

The functional response of the adult, third and fourth larval instars ofO. conglobata contaminatafed on the common pistachio psylla,A. pistaciae, was studied at 22 degrees and 25 degrees C (65 +/- 5%RH and 16 L: 8D). Different psylla densities of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 were used. The data were fitted a type II functional response in all the stages. There was a significant difference in the attack rate and handling time of the predator in all stages at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The maximum attack rate (T/T-h) occurred at 25 degrees C.The lowest and highest attack rates were 0.046 and 0.154 for adult of the predator at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The handling time decreased significantly as the temperature increased from 22 degrees C to 25 degrees C in all treatments. The results suggest that the efficiency of theOenopia conglobatato control the pistachio psylla is high at 25 degrees C. On the other hand, the predatory beetleO. conglobata contaminatareacted to increasing temperature by enhanced search rate and activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-7584	1742-7592		WOS:000564920300015

However, while effects of AGW on resource-consumer interactions at the first and second trophic level have been well studied, little is known about effects on interactions at higher trophic levels at the terminal end of food chains (e.g. in the third and fourth trophic levels). Here, we examined the effects of temperature variability by simulating heatwaves on functional responses of two species at the fourth trophic level (hyperparasitoids) that parasitize host species at the third trophic level (parasitoid cocoons). We found that host cocoons developed faster under simulated heatwave conditions, decreasing the temporal window of susceptibility of the host cocoons to parasitism by the two hyperparasitoids, and consequently parasitism declined with temperature. However, the effects of a simulated heatwave markedly differed among the two hyperparasitoid species; temperature and host quality had a much stronger effect on early reproduction in the less fecund hyperparasitoid Gelis agilis, than in the more fecund species Acrolyta nens. Our results suggest that exposure to heatwaves, that are expected to increase in frequency, will affect the ability of species at higher trophic levels to exploit transient resources whose suitability is temperature-dependent. In turn, the observed effects of AGW on the functional responses of the hyperparasitoids may disrupt trophic interactions and have profound impact on population dynamics and ecological processes.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000466375600014

Despite huge variations in the magnitude and duration of thermally-extreme episodes in nature, most empirical studies on predator-prey interactions consider conditions induced by a climatic shift in mean temperature. We asked whether the increased vulnerability of predators holds under daily thermal extremes occurring during heat waves, using dragonfly nymphs and newt larvae as the predator-prey model system. Direct exposure of predator to prey in heated and non-heated aquaria under semi-natural conditions revealed that predator movements increased with rising temperature, whereas prey activity decreased. In contrast to the theory of predator-prey space use, the spatial co-occurrence of predator and prey individuals increased with temperature, while predation rates diminished. We conclude that daily thermal extremes affect trophic interactions in the same way, i.e. through the increased vulnerability of predators, as do long-term shifts in mean environmental temperature. Our results highlight the importance of behavioral studies for understanding mechanisms mediating the effect of extreme thermal events on species interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we modelled the effects of increased water temperatures on consumption and growth rates of two piscivores (northern pike [Esox lucius] and largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides]) and examined relative effects of consumption by these predators on two prey species (bluegill [Lepomis macrochirus] and yellow perch [Perca flavescens]). Bioenergetics models were used to simulate the effects of climate change on growth and food consumption using predicted 2040 and 2060 temperatures in a shallow Nebraska Sandhill lake, USA. The patterns and magnitude of daily and cumulative consumption during the growing season (April-October) were generally similar between the two predators. However, growth of northern pike was always reduced (-3 to -45% change) compared to largemouth bass that experienced subtle changes (4 to -6% change) in weight by the end of the growing season. Assuming similar population size structure and numbers of predators in 2040-2060, futureconsumption of bluegill and yellow perch by northern pike and largemouth bass will likely increase (range: 3-24%), necessitating greater prey biomass to meet future energy demands. The timing of increased predator consumption will likely shift towards spring and fall (compared to summer), when prey species may not be available in the quantities required. Our findings suggest that increased water temperatures may affect species at the edge of their native range (i.e. northern pike) and a potential mismatch between predator and prey could exist.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000378625100014

We quantified trout diet, growth, and consumption in small headwater tributaries characterized as cold with low food and high trout density, larger tributaries characterized as cold with moderate food and moderate trout density, and large main stems characterized as warm with high food and low trout density. Brook trout consumption was highest in the main stem where diets shifted from insects in headwaters to fishes and crayfish in larger streams. Despite high water temperatures, trout growth rates also were consistently highest in the main stem, likely due to competitively dominant trout monopolizing thermal refugia. Temporal changes in trout density had a direct negative effect on brook trout growth rates. Our results suggest that competition for food constrains brook trout growth in small streams, but access to thermal refugia in productive main stem habitats enables dominant trout to supplement growth at a watershed scale. Brook trout conservation in this region should seek to relieve the "temperature-productivity squeeze," whereby brook trout productivity is constrained by access to habitats that provide both suitable water temperature and sufficient prey.									16	1	0	0	16	0	18			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000330967900011

An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25A degrees C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000426783400011

Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is known to prey on D. citri nymphs; we investigated the predation capacity and functional response of H. axyridis on adult D. citri. H. axyridis larvae exhibited Holling's type II functional response to different densities of adult D. citri. For second, third and fourth instar H. axyridis larvae, the successful attack rates were 0.75 +/- 0.22, 1.06 +/- 0.11, and 1.04 +/- 0.26, respectively; the handling times were 18.08 +/- 5.37, 0.45 +/- 0.07, and 0.24 +/- 0.07 h, respectively; and the estimated maximum predation rates were 4, 54, and 102, respectively. Fourth instar larvae had the lowest handling time. Adult H. axyridis consumed more D. citri adults maintained at 15-20 degrees C than at 30-35 degrees C, with an optimal temperature of 17.28 degrees C. More adults were consumed during the day than at night, with peak consumption between 12:00 and 14:00 h, not differing significantly differ between predator genders. Adult H. axyridis reared on the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum were tested for D. citri predation; these H. axyridis had successful attack rates, handling times, and estimated maximal predation rates of 0.66 +/- 0.18, 0.82 +/- 0.26 h, and 29, respectively. Conversely, those fed and tested on D. citri had corresponding rates of 0.99 +/- 0.17, 0.38 +/- 0.12 h, and 63, respectively. Significant H. axyridis predation on adult D. citri indicated its enhanced role in suppressing both nymph and adult D. citri.									0	2	0	0	1	0	2			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000458408400007

The rate declined with water temperature. Based on the gut clearance rate obtained here, we estimated the half-reduction time of gut contents and consumption rate of stoneflies on algae. Irrespective of stonefly species, the half-reduction time in winter (2 days) was twice as long as that in summer (1 day). The areal consumption rates of stoneflies varied depending on species and season. These results imply that the seasonal consumption impact of aquatic insects can be different, despite their daily ration being similar among species.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0912-3814	1440-1703		WOS:000261956100025

Haskell, Craig/0000-0002-3604-1758			Linking functional response and bioenergetics to estimate juvenile salmon growth in a reservoir food web								PLOS ONE				12	10					e0185933	10.1371/journal.pone.0185933				OCT 11 2017	2017	Juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) use of reservoir food webs is understudied. We examined the feeding behavior of subyearling Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and its relation to growth by estimating the functional response of juvenile salmon to changes in the density of Daphnia, an important component of reservoir food webs. We then estimated salmon growth across a broad range of water temperatures and daily rations of two primary prey, Daphnia and juvenile American shad (Alosa sapidissima) using a bioenergetics model. Laboratory feeding experiments yielded a Type-II functional response curve: C = 29.858 P *(4.271 + P)(-1) indicating that salmon consumption (C) of Daphnia was not affected until Daphnia densities (P) were < 30 . L-1. Past field studies documented Daphnia densities in lower Columbia River reservoirs of < 3 . L-1 in July but as high as 40 . L-1 in August. Bioenergetics modeling indicated that subyearlings could not achieve positive growth above 22 degrees C regardless of prey type or consumption rate. When feeding on Daphnia, subyearlings could not achieve positive growth above 20 degrees C (water temperatures they commonly encounter in the lower Columbia River during summer). At 16-18 degrees C, subyearlings had to consume about 27,000 Daphnia . day(-1) to achieve positive growth. However, when feeding on juvenile American shad, subyearlings had to consume 20 shad . day(-1) at 16-18 degrees C, or at least 25 shad . day(-1) at 20 degrees C to achieve positive growth. Using empirical consumption rates and water temperatures from summer 2013, subyearlings exhibited negative growth during July (-0.23 to -0.29 g . d(-1)) and August (-0.05 to -0.07 g . d(-1)). By switching prey from Daphnia to juvenile shad which have a higher energy density, subyearlings can partially compensate for the effects of higher water temperatures they experience in the lower Columbia River during summer. However, achieving positive growth as piscivores requires subyearlings to feed at higher consumption rates than they exhibited empirically. While our results indicate compromised growth in reservoir habitats, the long-term repercussions to salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin are unknown.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000412754400053	29020032

As the trophic structure and dynamics of ephemeral wetlands are poorly understood, it is difficult to predict how these biodiverse ecosystems will be impacted by global change. In particular, warming and salinisation are projected to have profound impacts on these wetlands in future. The present study examined the combined effects of warming and salinisation on species interaction strengths and mortality rates for two ephemeral wetland species. Using an ephemeral pond specialist copepod, Lovenula raynerae Suarez-Morales, Wasserman, & Dalu, (2015) as a model predator species, we applied a functional response approach to derive warming and salinisation effects on trophic interactions with a prey species. Furthermore, the effects of a salinisation gradient on mortality rates of adult copepods were quantified. The predatory copepod exhibited type II functional responses towards larval Culex pipiens mosquito prey, owing to high predation rates at low prey densities. Increased temperatures generally resulted in greater predator feeding rates, whilst increased salinities reduced consumption. However, the effects of temperature and salinity interacted: temperature effects on functional responses were suppressed under heightened salinities. Substantial mortality was observed in both male and female adult L. raynerae at salinity levels exceeding 10 parts per thousand. Warming and salinisation substantially altered interaction strengths in ephemeral wetland ecosystems, with implications for ecosystem function and stability. Furthermore, we demonstrated salinisation thresholds for mortality in an ephemeral wetland specialist, showing that salinisation may threaten the persistence of endemic species. The ongoing effects of warming and salinisation may therefore interact to alter trophic dynamics and species composition in ephemeral wetlands. These stressors should be considered synergistically within management practices.									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000480270700003

Many of these impacts are mediated through direct effects of temperature on individual vital rates. Yet how this translates from the individual to the population level is still poorly understood, hampering the assessment of global warming impacts on population structure and dynamics. Here, we study the effects of temperature on intraspecific competition and cannibalism and the population dynamical consequences in a size-structured fish population. We use a physiologically structured consumer-resource model in which we explicitly model the temperature dependencies of the consumer vital rates and the resource population growth rate. Our model predicts that increased temperature decreases resource density despite higher resource growth rates, reflecting stronger intraspecific competition among consumers. At a critical temperature, the consumer population dynamics destabilize and shift from a stable equilibrium to competition-driven generation cycles that are dominated by recruits. As a consequence, maximum age decreases and the proportion of younger and smaller-sized fish increases. These model predictions support the hypothesis of decreasing mean body sizes due to increased temperatures. We conclude that in size-structured fish populations, global warming may increase competition, favor smaller size classes, and induce regime shifts that destabilize population and community dynamics.									52	0	0	0	53	0	53			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000286789700006	21460557

Approximately 80% of their annual growth in length and mass was attained during late summer and autumn. Growth was minimal during winter (January-February) and spring (March-May). The number of walleye with empty stomachs was highest during the summer. Invertebrates (Cladocera, Chironomidae) were common in walleye stomachs during the summer and spring, but contributed little to the ingested biomass. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum dominated walleye diets (per cent by mass) throughout the year. A bioenergetics model predicted that the proportion of maximum consumption (P-c) was highest during the autumn and was probably due to spatial overlap of walleye and gizzard shad once water temperatures were <22degreesC. The bioenergetics model predicted that walleye would lose up to 65% of their body mass during the summer if water temperature increased by 10% (as predicted by some global warming models). Growth during the autumn, winter and spring was enhanced up to 150% by increased temperatures. The results of this study indicate that lower condition, reduced consumption and slow growth are a generalized, response of walleye to extreme temperatures. Elevated temperatures may have a net positive effect on walleye growth if they can survive the high thermal stress during summer. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Using a simple mechanistic model, we demonstrate that differences in the relative performances of predator and prey can cause strong threshold effects in the temperature dependence of attack rates. Empirical data on the attack rate of northern pike (Esox lucius) feeding on brown trout (Salmo trutta) confirm this result. Attack rates fell sharply below a threshold temperature of +11 degrees C, which corresponded to a shift in relative performance of pike and brown trout with respect to maximum attack and escape swimming speeds. The average attack speed of pike was an order of magnitude lower than the escape speed of brown trout at 5 degrees C, but approximately equal at temperatures above 11 degrees C. Thresholds in the temperature dependence of ecological rates can create tipping points in the responses of ecosystems to increasing temperatures. Thus, identifying thresholds is crucial when predicting future effects of climate warming.									42	0	0	0	39	0	42			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000345624600010	25473013

The results indicated that the predatory thrips exhibited type-II functional responses against the mites under various temperatures, and that females are more voracious than males. Analysis showed that temperature had significant effects on the predatory capacity of adult thrips over the range of 20-35 degrees C. Attack rate in females linearly increased with temperature while in males it was independent of temperature. Handling times in both males and females decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Extended response models describing the functional response with temperature incorporated as a parameter were developed, yielding an estimated maximum numbers of prey attacked at four temperatures were 38.38, 55.06, 71.74 and 88.42 eggs per day for females, and 15.11, 26.11, 37.11 and 48.01 eggs per day for males, respectively. The age of predator affected both the type of the functional response shown and the magnitude of predation by S.takahashii on the spider mite. Females of various ages exhibited Type-II functional responses with similar attack rates, but handling time prolonged linearly as age increased: the handling times in 15- and 18-d-old females were significantly longer than in 6-d-old thrips. However, Type-I functional responses were determined for males aged 12 d or more; the maximum number of prey eaten in 24 h decreased as age increased. The implications of the results for the management of hawthorn spider mite are discussed.									31	3	0	0	33	1	36			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000243602200004

While efforts to document and integrate inter- and intraspecific effects are ongoing, few broad conclusions have emerged. Here, we use a simple structured predator-prey model to explore whether some such conclusions can be reached with incomplete knowledge about initial population sizes or about how temperature alters predation rates. We find that, despite strong sensitivity of quantitative predictions to the model's details, qualitative predictions for how predator-prey communities respond to temperature may still be possible. As a case study, we ask whether biological control of the herbivorous insect pea aphid will be strengthened or weakened by increasing temperatures. Our empirically derived parameter estimates suggest biological control will be strengthened, but we caution that this result is not inevitable given what we currently know about the effects of temperature in this system. Our work highlights the complex interaction between inter- and intraspecific effects of temperature in ecological communities.									11	1	0	0	10	0	12			1438-3896	1438-390X		WOS:000333352500011

Recent studies have used the equation of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) to quantify the effect of temperature on the parameter Th, called handling time, and then predict the responses of predators and communities to climate change. However, our understanding of the processes behind Th and how they vary with temperature remains limited. Using a ladybeetle-aphid system, we compared estimates of Th to direct observations of handling time across a temperature gradient. We found estimated Th values to be greater than observed Th values, suggesting that predation rate is not limited by the time available for handling prey. We next estimated the corrected digestion time, i.e., digestion time corrected for gut capacity, by subtracting observed to estimated Th values. We finally plotted the relationships between temperature and handling or digestion rates. As predicted by MTE, the corrected digestion rate increased exponentially with warming whereas, in contrast to MTE prediction, the relationship between handling rate and temperature was hump shaped. The parameter Th is thus confusing because it combines handling and digestive processes that have different thermal responses. This may explain why general patterns in the relationship between Th and temperature have been difficult to identify in previous studies.									24	0	0	0	24	0	24			0012-9658			WOS:000322336600002	24015511

Functional response studies are often used to determine the suitability of predators as biocontrol agents. Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are often used for the control of crop pests such as aphids. However, most functional response studies on coccinellids compare a limited number of species at different life stages, temperatures or sexes. A large-scale comparison of ladybird beetle functional responses is needed to evaluate the utility of these species as potential biocontrol predators and to understand the traits that influence the interaction strength between ladybird beetles and their prey.2. We compiled 158 ladybird beetle functional responses from 30 studies and tested for effects of taxa, traits, temperature and arena size on functional response parameters using linear mixed-effects models.3. Our results show that functional response parameters (handling time and space clearance rate) are affected by predator stage, predator mass, prey type, temperature and arena size. Although complicated by interaction terms, space clearance rate generally increased with predator size, temperature and predator stage, while handling time decreased with predator size, temperature and predator stage. Coleopteran prey induced the highest handling times.4. Our results also show that experimental arena size has a large, consistent effect on space clearance rate. Arena size is more important in determining foraging rates at low prey densities than any other factor considered here, including predator mass and temperature. Efforts to use laboratory-based functional response experiments to evaluate the efficacy of biocontrol predators are therefore confounded by the choice of arena size.									18	0	0	0	16	0	17			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000441438600032

However, living organisms rarely experience these conditions in real field situations. Understanding the impact of pesticides on non-target beneficial arthropods under temperature stresses is especially important in terms of global warming. We assessed the lethal and sublethal effects of four modern insecticides (chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, spinetoram, spinosad), on the generalist predatorMacrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera: Miridae) under a range of temperatures (from 10 to 40 degrees C) frequently experienced in a real field scenario. A reduction coefficient (E-x) was calculated by summarizing the mortality and predator reproductive capacity and, the chemicals were classified according to the International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC) toxicity classes. The insecticides showed a marked synergistic effect with temperature, as the predator mortality and reproductive outputs were significantly correlated with increasing temperatures. Spinosyns interacted significantly with temperature causing the highest mortality and lowest fertility rates. Anthranilic diamides showed a safer ecotoxicological profile compared to spinosyns, with cyantraniliprole being more harmful than chlorantraniliprole. These results suggest that temperature should be taken into account in pesticide ecotoxicology studies within the framework of integrated pest management and the recent climate changes.

Mussels grew faster during warmer climatic events. Growth was initially faster on a more productive cape compared to a less productive cape. Growth rates at the two capes merged in 2002, coincidentally with a several year-long shift from warm to cool PDO conditions. To determine the mechanism underlying this response, we examined growth responses to intertidal sea and air temperatures, phytoplankton, sea level and tide height. Together, water temperature (32%) and food (12.5%) explained 44.5% of the variance in mussel growth; contributions of other factors were not significant. In turn, water temperature and food respond to climate-driven variation in upwelling and other, unknown factors. Understanding responses of ecosystem engineers to climate change will require knowing direct thermal effects and indirect effects of factors altered by temperature change.									84	1	0	0	72	0	85			1461-023X			WOS:000252206800006	18034837

Native predators may constrain prey shifting poleward through consumption, or by restricting their feeding activity. However, the extent that native predators impact range-expanders will likely be structured by physiological mismatches between these groups, associated with water temperatures. We examined how temperate predators and seasonal water temperature affected foraging of the planktivorous tropical reef fish, Abudefduf vaigiensis, within temperate southeastern Australian waters, an emerging new range. Foraging excursions of A. vaigiensis were compared between predator-rich marine reserves and predator-depauperate fished reefs during summer and winter (similar to 18 and 22 degrees C water, respectively). A. vaigiensis foraged with shorter excursions in marine reserves than fished reefs and higher excursions during summer than winter. Effects of predation risk and water temperature on A. vaigiensis foraging were isolated in an aquarium experiment. Groups were held at 18 or 22 degrees C and visually exposed to a temperate predator, a predator control (temperate herbivore) and an empty tank. Foraging excursions and feeding rates were reduced when exposed to predators at 22 degrees C, but did not differ between predator and the predator control or empty tank at 18 degrees C. Results suggest temperate predators may restrict range expansions of A. vaigiensis by reducing its' food intake during summer months. But winter water temperatures may limit feeding, independent of predation risk. Protection of predators from fishing should improve resistance of some marine ecosystems to impacts of range expanding prey.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000373019300003

Novel aspects of their growth and reproduction mean that they are likely to play an important role in the changing oceans due to climate change. Virtually every facet of squid life-history examined thus far has revealed an incredible capacity in this group for life-history plasticity. The extremely fast growth rates of individuals and rapid rates of turnover at the population level mean that squid can respond quickly to environmental or ecosystem change. Their 'life-in-the-fast-lane' lifestyle allows them to rapidly exploit 'vacuums' created in the ecosystem when predators or competitors are removed. In this way, they function as 'weeds of the sea'. Elevated temperatures accelerate the life-histories of squid, increasing their growth rates and shortening their life-spans. At first glance, it would be logical to suggest that rising water temperatures associated with climate change ( if food supply remains adequate) would be beneficial to inshore squid populations and fisheries-growth rates would increase, life spans would shorten and population turnover would accelerate. However, the response of inshore squid populations to climate change is likely to be extremely complex. The size of hatchlings emerging from the eggs becomes smaller as temperatures increase and hatchling size may have a critical influence on the size-at-age that may be achieved as adults and subsequently, population structure. The influence of higher temperatures on the egg and adult stages may thus be opposing forces on the life-history. The process of climate change will likely result in squids that hatch out smaller and earlier, undergo faster growth over shorter life-spans and mature younger and at a smaller size. Individual squid will require more food per unit body size, require more oxygen for faster metabolisms and have a reduced capacity to cope without food. It is therefore likely that biological, physiological and behavioural changes in squid due to climate change will have far reaching effects.									85	2	0	0	78	3	90			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000260368300002

Ectothermic omnivores increase herbivory in response to rising temperature								OIKOS				129	7			1028	1039		10.1111/oik.07082		MAR 2020		JUL 2020	2020	Higher temperatures as a consequence of global climate change may considerably alter trophic interactions. Ectothermic herbivores and carnivores generally ingest more food with rising temperature as their metabolic rates increase with rising temperature. However, omnivorous ectotherms may respond in two ways: quantitatively by consuming more food and qualitatively by altering their degree of herbivory or carnivory through a diet shift. We hypothesize that rising temperature will increase herbivory of ectothermic omnivores as herbivory increases towards the equator. We tested the hypothesis in a freshwater model system in which ectothermic omnivores are prevalent, by applying two approaches, a temperature manipulation experiment and a literature study. We performed feeding trials with a juvenile aquatic ectothermic omnivore (pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) at different temperatures ranging from 12 to 27 degrees C, supplying them with both animal food and plant material, and directly quantified their consumption rates over time. The results showed that snails cultured at high temperatures (> 21 degrees C) increased the proportion of plant material in their diets after 17 days, which supports our hypothesis. In the literature survey, we found that rising temperature increased herbivory in multiple aquatic animal taxa, including zooplankton, amphibians, crayfish, fish and snails. This suggests that aquatic ectothermic omnivores might commonly increase herbivory with rising temperature. The mechanisms underlying this temperature-induced diet shift are not sufficiently explained by current theories related to the physiology, metabolism and stoichiometry of omnivores. We propose to incorporate the animals' ontogenetic development in the temperature metabolic stoichiometry hypothesis as a complementary explanation for the diet shift, namely that the diet shift could be due to faster development of the ectotherms and an earlier ontogenetic diet shift at higher temperatures. We conclude that future global warming will most likely alter food webs by increasing the top-down control of aquatic herbivores and omnivores on primary producers.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000522509500001

Three constant temperatures (15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and six prey densities (5, 10, 20, 35, 50, and 70) were tested over a 24-h period. Nesidiocoris tenuis exhibited a type II functional response at 15 and 25 degrees C, and a type III response at 35 degrees C. The number of prey consumed by the predator increased with increase in the prey density at all temperatures. Temperature influenced attack rates and handling times. The highest attack rate occurred at 35 degrees C at high densities (35, 50, and 70 prey) and the lowest handling time was recorded at 35 degrees C. The maximum attack rates (T/Th) were 17.13, 42.12, and 45.07 whitefly pupae per day at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively. As a result, the value of a/T-h indicates that N. tenuis was relatively more efficient in attacking B. tabaci at 35 degrees C than at lower temperatures. Results suggest that the ability of N. tenuis to detect and consume B. tabaci over a broad range of temperatures, especially high temperatures (25-35 degrees C), makes this mirid a good candidate for the biological control of whiteflies in warm environments, such as greenhouses.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7				1802-8829		WOS:000419219900021

Fishes were presented with small copepod (Tisbi sp.) or larger mysid shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia) prey at varying densities ranging from 1 to 235 prey l(-1) in feeding rate experiments conducted at water temperatures ranging from 10.5 to 12.0 degrees C under high light levels and low turbidity conditions. Juvenile pink and chum salmon demonstrated a type II functional response to mysid and copepod prey. Mysid prey was readily selected by both species whereas the smaller bodied copepod prey was not. When offered copepods, pink salmon fry fed at a higher maximum consumption rate (2.5 copepods min(-1)) than larger juvenile pink salmon (0.4 copepods min(-1)), whereas larger juvenile chum salmon exhibited the highest feeding rate (3.8 copepods min(-1)). When feeding on mysids, the maximum feeding rate for larger juvenile pink (12.3 mysids min(-1)) and chum (11.5 mysids min(-1)) salmon were similar in magnitude, and higher than feeding rates on copepods. Functional response models parameterized for specific sizes of juvenile salmon and zooplankton prey provide an important tool for linking feeding rates to ambient foraging conditions in marine environments, and can enable mechanistic predictions for how feeding and growth should respond to spatial-temporal variability in biological and physical conditions during early marine life stages.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000243976700022

The first recorded Atlantic population of the mytilid Xenostrobus seams, originally from New Zealand, offers an opportunity to examine how native predators may control the outcome of invasions. Laboratory experiments were done to evaluate the impact of the native crab. Carcinus maenas, on 2 species of mussels, X. securis and the native Mytilus galloprovincialis, at 3 different temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C). In addition, we investigated handling time, breaking time and profitability for both species of mussel. We tested the hypotheses that (1) C. maenas exerts a greater predation pressure on the native mussel and (2) C. maenas increases its ingestion of the most profitable species of mussel at higher temperatures. The first hypothesis was supported because C maenas consumed greater than twice as many native mussels as invasive ones at all temperatures. This greater consumption of M. galloprovincialis could be explained by its greater profitability and shorter handling and breaking time. These results are in concordance with the enemy release hypothesis suggesting that C. maenas might facilitate the invasion of X. securis. The consumer-prey relationship was not significantly affected by temperature although the number of X. securis ingested by C maenas tended to decrease with increasing temperature, whereas the number of M. galloprovincialis consumed increased at the highest temperature. Results, therefore, suggest that global warming could enhance the facilitation of the invasion of X. securis due to its lower profitability and greater handling and breaking time.

The ramifications of temperature for ecological communities include not only its direct effects on the physiology of individuals, but also how these effects play out in the context of other processes such as competition. Apparently idiosyncratic or difficult to predict effects of temperature on competitive outcomes are well represented in the literature. General theoretical understanding of how physiological influences of temperature filter through community dynamics to determine outcomes is limited. We present a theoretical framework for predicting the effects of temperature on competition among species, based on understanding the effects of temperature on the physiological and population parameters of the species. The approach helps unify formal resource competition theory with metabolic and physiological ecology. Phytoplankton and many other ectotherms are smaller at higher temperatures. This has been observed experimentally, across geographical gradients, and as change accompanying climate warming, but it has not been explained in terms of competition. As a case study, we apply our theoretical framework to competition for nutrients among differently sized phytoplankton. Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that the prevalence of smaller phytoplankton at higher temperatures is at least partly due to an accentuated competitive advantage of smaller cells at higher temperatures with respect to nutrient uptake and growth. We examine the scope for extending the approach to understand resource competition, generally, among ectotherms of different sizes.									40	0	0	0	36	0	40			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000328615300008	23521010

However, development of appropriate temperature standards requires a robust understanding of the interactions among water temperature, ecosystem productivity, and fish performance. We used a series of in situ enclosures to examine how natural spatiotemporal gradients in thermal conditions and prey availability affected the summer growth and survival of age-0+ coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Coho salmon absolute growth rates peaked at a mean daily average water temperature (mean T) of 16.6 degrees C and an associated maximum weekly maximum temperature (MWMT) of 21.1 degrees C. Juvenile growth under these thermal conditions was sixfold greater than the growth rates observed for conspecifics rearing in the coolest study reach (mean T = 13.0 degrees C; MWMT = 16.0 degrees C). Even at the highest rearing temperature (mean T = 18.1 degrees C; MWMT = 24.0 degrees C), growth rates remained positive and above the study-wide average, although overall survival was reduced. Among the predictor variables examined, invertebrate prey abundance was the predominant factor influencing age-0+ coho salmon growth. These results suggest that abundant prey resources may mitigate the negative effects of elevated water temperature on fish growth in riverine environments. Given the likelihood of increasing stream temperatures with climate change, productive ecosystems may provide critical refuges for juvenile salmonids.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000514074000017

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				390	1			31	38		10.1016/j.jembe.2010.04.027				JUL 15 2010	2010	Variability in infaunal bivalve abundance in the Wadden Sea is largely determined by recruitment variability. Post-settlement, but pre-recruitment bivalve mortality is high and related to the occurrence of their most abundant predator, the brown shrimp Crangon crangon. To investigate if the mortality patterns of newly settled bivalves can be explained by the foraging behavior of brown shrimp, we carried out experiments on shrimp functional response to three size classes of juveniles of the Baltic Tellin Macoma balthica. The functional response curves for all three prey sizes (0.62 mm, 0.73 mm, and 0.85 mm) were the hyperbolic Holling's type II. The attack rate was highest for the smallest prey size (a = 0.31, medium and large prey a = 0.22); the handling time was longest for the largest prey size (T-h = 29 s. small and medium prey T-h = 15 s). Thus, a large body size is advantageous for the bivalves over the whole density range. Knowledge of individual foraging behavior is needed to model predation mortality of bivalves. The consumption rates in the experiment were theoretically high enough to account for M. balthica mortality in the field. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Comparative functional responses analysis can be used under different abiotic contexts to improve understanding and prediction of the ecological impact of invasive species. Pterois volitans (Lionfish) [Linnaeus 1758] is an established invasive species in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, with a more recent invasion into the Mediterranean. Lionfish are generalist predators that impact a wide range of commercial and non-commercial species. Functional response analysis was employed to quantify interaction strength between lionfish and a generic prey species, the shrimp (Paleomonetes varians) [Leach 1814], under the contexts of differing temperature, habitat complexity and light wavelength. Lionfish have prey population destabilising Type II functional responses under all contexts examined. Significantly more prey were consumed at 26 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. Habitat complexity did not significantly alter the functional response parameters. Significantly more prey were consumed under white light and blue light than under red light. Attack rate was significantly higher under white light than under blue or red light. Light wavelength did not significantly change handling times. The impacts on prey populations through feeding rates may increase with concomitant temperature increase. As attack rates are very high at low habitat complexity this may elucidate the cause of high impact upon degraded reef ecosystems with low-density prey populations, although there was little protection conferred through habitat complexity. Only red light (i.e. dark) afforded any reduction in predation pressure. Management initiatives should account for these environmental factors when planning mitigation and prevention strategies.									20	0	0	0	20	0	20			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000412840700001

Species interactions relay the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on individuals to communities, and detailed understanding across these levels is crucial to predict ecological consequences of climate change. We provide a conceptual framework that links temperature effects on insect physiology and behaviour to altered species interactions and community dynamics. We highlight key features of this framework with recent studies investigating the impacts of warming climate on insects and other ectotherms and identify methodological, taxonomic and geographic biases. While the effects of increased constant temperatures are now well understood, future studies should focus on temperature variation, interactions with other stressors and cross-system comparisons.									12	0	0	0	8	0	12			2214-5745	2214-5753		WOS:000490898000014	31445412

The functional response of shrimp to 6 densities of flounder was determined at 2 temperatures (10 and 16degreesC). The behavioral mechanisms underlying the shrimp's functional response were quantified with visual observations and compared to the foraging parameters predicted by continuous-time functional response models. Shrimp consumption rates increased significantly with increasing flounder density, irrespective of water temperature. At low flounder densities, however, significantly more flounder were consumed at 16degreesC than at 10degreesC. Analysis of proportional mortality of flounder across prey density and general functional response models revealed a sigmoidal, Type III functional response at 10degreesC, and a hyperbolic, Type II functional response at 16degreesC. Model parameter estimates and visual observations of shrimp foraging behavior suggest that the variable functional responses at different temperatures are the result of cold temperatures decreasing predator activity at low flounder densities, and conversely, shrimp maintaining high attack rates at low flounder densities when exposed to warm temperatures. These findings indicate that shrimp are capable of driving flounder populations to local extinction during warm water conditions. The recent warming trend experienced in northwest Atlantic estuaries, and its impact on trophic dynamics, may therefore explain the failure of the winter flounder stocks to recover in these areas.									56	0	0	0	52	0	57			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000187934600019

In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small-over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming.									106	2	0	0	97	0	107			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000309253400001	23007078

Prey consumption increased with increases in temperature and prey density. Handling time decreased and successful attack rate increased with increased temperature. N. longispinosus was more voracious on larvae and nymphs than on adults of O. coffeae. Handling time was higher on adult females than on larvae. Rate of predation leveled off at temperatures greater than 25 degrees C. Functional responses to prey density at six temperatures and to each life stage of O. coffeae approximated the Holling type II model. The oviposition rate increased with prey consumption and temperature. On average, a predator consumed 1.62 adult female prey for every egg it laid. With a fixed number of prey available, predation rate per predator decreased with increased predator density.									7	0	0	0	6	1	10				1536-2442		WOS:000310727600002	23452011

Lateral connectivity of river main stems with off-channel habitats may play an integral role in sustaining Alaskan salmonid populations because off-channel habitats commonly provide greater growth opportunities than main stem habitats through greater macroinvertebrate productivity and warmer water temperatures. However, off-channel habitats may impose greater mortality risks to juvenile salmonids, as these habitats are typically more susceptible to drying and are often occupied by potential predators. We used a hierarchical Bayesian count model to describe juvenile Chinook salmon distributions throughout the Chena River, Alaska in main stem and off-channel habitats and employed diet, prey availability, and bioenergetic analyses to explain these habitat selection decisions from data collected in the summer of 2015. We found salmon to be most abundant in off-channel habitats as summer temperature increased, which suggested that salmon dispersed to off-channel habitats to take advantage of energetically favourable growth conditions as indicated by the higher prey biomass in benthic and diet samples collected within off-channel habitats. Our results could have significant implications for juvenile salmon under a warming Alaskan climate as access to productive off-channel habitats may be important to offset increased energetic costs as temperature warms.									5	0	0	0	5	0	6			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000458406900004

However, several studies have recently reported a different tendency as follows. Observed densities of chum salmon were higher in the vicinity of the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea than the eastern Bering Sea in September 2007, and Japanese chum salmon migrated to northern areas in the Bering Sea during summer 2009. The sea surface temperature (SST) in the Arctic marginal seas has increased since the mid1960s, and especially since 2000. We speculated that the SST increase directly promoted salmon northing from the Bering Sea to the Western Arctic. In this study, we estimated the potential habitat for chum salmon in the Western Arctic using a bioenergetics model coupled with a three-dimensional lower trophic ecosystem model (3-D NEMURO). "Potential habitat" was defined as "an area where chum salmon could grow (i.e., the growth rate was positive)". In the bioenergetics model, the growth rate of an individual chum salmon was calculated as a function of water temperature, salinity, and prey density, which were obtained from the 3-D NEMURO model results. To evaluate the habitat responses under a global warming scenario, we used the modeled monthly change of water temperature between 2005 (averaged from 2001 to 2010) and 2095 (averaged from 2091 to 2100) under the IPCC SRES-A1 B scenario. Our calculations, following the global warming scenario, suggested that the potential habitat for chum salmon would expand to the north due to the increase in water temperature and prey density. In contrast, south of 71 degrees N during summer, the potential habitat would shrink regionally because the water temperature exceeded the optimal condition. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Freshwater microcosms were used to test the effect of temperature on the life history traits of a prey species, the fairy shrimp Chirocephalus diaphanus (Anostraca), the abundance of a predator, the microcrustacean Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda), and on the interaction between them. When reared in the absence of predators, C.diaphanus survival was low at the highest temperature (25 degrees C) and greatly reduced at the lowest temperature (5 degrees C). It was reproductively most successful at an intermediate temperature (20 degrees C), suggesting that it may benefit from the increase in temperature predicted under future climate change scenarios. In the absence of other species, temperature would have to increase dramatically to affect C.diaphanus adversely.Heterocypris incongruens was more abundant and its predation on C.diaphanus greatest at higher temperatures, partially offsetting the positive effect of raised temperature on prey observed when the predator was absent. The net effect was that the optimal temperature for C.diaphanus when coexisting with its predator was lower than when it was in isolation. This means that currently predicted increases in temperature ultimately may be detrimental to C.diaphanus. Predation rates were generally enhanced by high temperature, prey size and prey density, with significant interaction between them. Thus, the positive effects of raised temperature on predation rate were additionally dependent upon prey characteristics, being strongest when prey were large and at high density and weakest when prey were small and at low density. Interactions with a natural enemy, in this case a predator, may alter how species respond to raised temperatures; prey size and density further modify the outcome of this interaction. This context dependency in the response of both predators and prey to temperature suggests that the ecological impacts of future climate change on trophic interactions may be difficult to predict.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000326021800004

Differential ecological impacts of invader and native predatory freshwater amphipods under environmental change are revealed by comparative functional responses								BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				17	6			1761	1770		10.1007/s10530-014-0832-9				JUN 2015	2015	Predicting the ecological impacts of damaging invasive species under relevant environmental contexts is a major challenge, for which comparative functional responses (the relationship between resource availability and consumer uptake rate) have great potential. Here, the functional responses of Gammarus pulex, an ecologically damaging invader in freshwaters in Ireland and other islands, were compared with those of a native trophic equivalent Gammarus duebeni celticus. Experiments were conducted at two dissolved oxygen concentrations (80 and 50 % saturation), representative of anthropogenic water quality changes, using two larval prey, blackfly (Simuliidae spp.) and mayfly (Baetis rhodani). Overall, Gammarus pulex had higher Type II functional responses and hence predatory impacts than Gammarus duebeni celticus and the functional responses of both predators were reduced by lowered oxygen concentration. However, this reduction was of lower magnitude for the invader as compared to the native. Further, the invader functional response at low oxygen was comparable to that of the native at high oxygen. Attack rates of the two predators were similar, with low oxygen reducing these attack rates, but this effect occurred more strongly for blackfly than mayfly prey. Handling times were significantly lower for the invader compared with the native, and significantly higher at low oxygen, however, the effect of lowered oxygen on handling times was minimal for the invader and pronounced for the native. Maximum feeding rates were significantly greater for the invader compared with the native, and significantly reduced at low oxygen, with this effect again lesser for the invader as compared to the native. The greater functional responses of the invader corroborate with its impacts on recipient macroinvertebrate communities when it replaces the native. Further, our experiments predict that the impact of the invader will be less affected than the native under altered oxygen regimes driven by anthropogenic influences.									30	0	0	0	26	0	30			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000354373500015

Embryos of oviparous elasmobranchs may be further challenged during development by rising temperatures and falling dissolved oxygen concentrations in their intertidal environment. However, the impact of climate change on survival and growth of oviparous elasmobranchs is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature and hypoxia on the growth and survival of small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) embryos by incubating eggs in normoxia 15 degrees C, normoxia 20 degrees C, hypoxia 15 degrees C, or hypoxia 20 degrees C. Incubation under the elevated temperature increased the embryonic growth rate, yolk consumption rate and Fulton's condition factor at hatching, whilst decreasing the total length and body mass of newly hatched sharks. Under low oxygen conditions (50% air saturation) the survival rate ofS. caniculaembryos dropped significantly and the temperature-induced increase in Fulton's condition factor was reversed. Together, these data demonstrate both the individual and compound effects of elevated temperature and hypoxia on the survival and growth during early ontogeny of a ubiquitous, coastal elasmobranch,S. canicula.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000539457800001	32383486

Elisa; Ffrench-Constant, Richard; Lowe, Chris; Olafsson, Jon S.; Padfield, Daniel; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel		Student Res Team						Temperature-driven selection on metabolic traits increases the strength of an algal-grazer interaction in naturally warmed streams								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				24	4			1793	1803		10.1111/gcb.14033				APR 2018	2018	Trophic interactions are important determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Because the metabolism and consumption rates of ectotherms increase sharply with temperature, there are major concerns that global warming will increase the strength of trophic interactions, destabilizing food webs, and altering ecosystem structure and function. We used geothermally warmed streams that span an 11 degrees C temperature gradient to investigate the interplay between temperature-driven selection on traits related to metabolism and resource acquisition, and the interaction strength between the keystone gastropod grazer, Radix balthica, and a common algal resource. Populations from a warm stream (similar to 28 degrees C) had higher maximal metabolic rates and optimal temperatures than their counterparts from a cold stream (similar to 17 degrees C). We found that metabolic rates of the population originating from the warmer stream were higher across all measurement temperatures. A reciprocal transplant experiment demonstrated that the interaction strengths between the grazer and its algal resource were highest for both populations when transplanted into the warm stream. In line with the thermal dependence of respiration, interaction strengths involving grazers from the warm stream were always higher than those with grazers from the cold stream. These results imply that increases in metabolism and resource consumption mediated by the direct, thermodynamic effects of higher temperatures on physiological rates are not mitigated by metabolic compensation in the long term, and suggest that warming could increase the strength of algal-grazer interactions with likely knock-on effects for the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic ecosystems.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000426504400029	29281766	
J	Amarasekare, Priyanga								Effects of temperature on consumer-resource interactions								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				84	3			665	679		10.1111/1365-2656.12320				MAY 2015	2015	Understanding how temperature variation influences the negative (e.g. self-limitation) and positive (e.g. saturating functional responses) feedback processes that characterize consumer-resource interactions is an important research priority. Previous work on this topic has yielded conflicting outcomes with some studies predicting that warming should increase consumer-resource oscillations and others predicting that warming should decrease consumer-resource oscillations. Here, I develop a consumer-resource model that both synthesizes previous findings in a common framework and yields novel insights about temperature effects on consumer-resource dynamics. I report three key findings. First, when the resource species' birth rate exhibits a unimodal temperature response, as demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies, the temperature range over which the consumer-resource interaction can persist is determined by the lower and upper temperature limits to the resource species' reproduction. This contrasts with the predictions of previous studies, which assume that the birth rate exhibits a monotonic temperature response, that consumer extinction is determined by temperature effects on consumer species' traits, rather than the resource species' traits. Secondly, the comparative analysis I have conducted shows that whether warming leads to an increase or decrease in consumer-resource oscillations depends on the manner in which temperature affects intraspecific competition. When the strength of self-limitation increases monotonically with temperature, warming causes a decrease in consumer-resource oscillations. However, if self-limitation is strongest at temperatures physiologically optimal for reproduction, a scenario previously unanalysed by theory but amply substantiated by empirical data, warming can cause an increase in consumer-resource oscillations. Thirdly, the model yields testable comparative predictions about consumer-resource dynamics under alternative hypotheses for how temperature affects competitive and resource acquisition traits. Importantly, it does so through empirically quantifiable metrics for predicting temperature effects on consumer viability and consumer-resource oscillations, which obviates the need for parameterizing complex dynamical models. Tests of these metrics with empirical data on a host-parasitoid interaction yield realistic estimates of temperature limits for consumer persistence and the propensity for consumer-resource oscillations, highlighting their utility in predicting temperature effects, particularly warming, on consumer-resource interactions in both natural and agricultural settings.									35	0	0	0	28	0	35			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000353405300010	25412342

Because many of the underlying mechanisms of foraging are temperature dependent in ectotherms, the distribution of ectothermic foragers between food patches may similarly depend on temperature because the difference in fitness rewards between these patches may change with temperature. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of Common Gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) between food patches can be explained by an IFD, but that conformance to an IFD weakens as temperature departs from the optimal temperature because fitness rewards, interference competition and the number of individuals foraging are highest at the optimal temperature. First, we determined the optimal temperature for foraging. Second, we examined group foraging at three temperatures and three density treatments. Search time was optimized at 27 degrees C, handling time at 29 degrees C and digestion time at 32 degrees C. Gartersnakes did not match an IFD at any temperature, but their distribution did change with temperature: snakes at 20 degrees C and at 30 degrees C selected both food patches equally, while snakes at 25 degrees C selected the low food patch more at low density and the high food patch more at high density. Food consumption and competition increased with temperature, and handling time decreased with temperature. Temperature therefore had a strong impact on foraging, but did not affect the IFD. Future work should examine temperature-dependent foraging in ectotherms that are known to match an IFD.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			0179-1613	1439-0310		WOS:000385572700007

Habitat conditions and physiological optima offer predictive information for IAS impacts in novel environments. Here, using meta-analysis and laboratory experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the impacts of IAS in the field are inversely correlated with the difference in their ambient and optimal temperatures. A meta-analysis of 29 studies of consumptive impacts of IAS in inland waters revealed that the impacts of fishes and crustaceans are higher at temperatures that more closely match their thermal growth optima. In particular, the maximum impact potential was constrained by increased differences between ambient and optimal temperatures, as indicated by the steeper slope of a quantile regression on the upper 25th percentile of impact data compared to that of a weighted linear regression on all data with measured variances. We complemented this study with an experimental analysis of the functional response (the relationship between predation rate and prey supply) of two invasive predators (freshwater mysid shrimp, Hemimysis anomala and Mysis diluviana) across relevant temperature gradients; both of these species have previously been found to exert strong community-level impacts that are corroborated by their functional responses to different prey items. The functional response experiments showed that maximum feeding rates of H. anomala and M. diluviana have distinct peaks near their respective thermal optima. Although variation in impacts may be caused by numerous abiotic or biotic habitat characteristics, both our analyses point to temperature as a key mediator of IAS impact levels in inland waters and suggest that IAS management should prioritize habitats in the invaded range that more closely match the thermal optima of targeted invaders.									31	0	0	0	29	0	31			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000351849700011	26214916

Subarctic freshwaters are sentinels for understanding both stressors because the effects of climate change are disproportionately strong at high latitudes and invasion of temperate species is prevalent. Here, we summarize the environmental effects of climate change and illustrate the ecological responses of freshwater fishes to these effects, spanning individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Climate change is modifying hydrological cycles across atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic components of subarctic ecosystems, causing increases in ambient water temperature and nutrient availability. These changes affect the individual behavior, habitat use, growth and metabolism, alter population spawning and recruitment dynamics, leading to changes in species abundance and distribution, modify food web structure, trophic interactions and energy flow within communities and change the sources, quantity and quality of energy and nutrients in ecosystems. Increases in temperature and its variability in aquatic environments underpin many ecological responses; however, altered hydrological regimes, increasing nutrient inputs and shortened ice cover are also important drivers of climate change effects and likely contribute to context-dependent responses. Species invasions are a complex aspect of the ecology of climate change because the phenomena of invasion are both an effect and a driver of the ecological consequences of climate change. Using subarctic freshwaters as an example, we illustrate how climate change can alter three distinct aspects of species invasions: (1) the vulnerability of ecosystems to be invaded, (2) the potential for species to spread and invade new habitats, and (3) the subsequent ecological effects of invaders. We identify three fundamental knowledge gaps focused on the need to determine (1) how environmental and landscape characteristics influence the ecological impact of climate change, (2) the separate and combined effects of climate and non-native invading species and (3) the underlying ecological processes or mechanisms responsible for changes in patterns of biodiversity.									19	0	0	0	19	0	21			2045-7758			WOS:000403884700004	28649324	
J	Sanford, E								Water temperature, predation, and the neglected role of physiological rate effects in rocky intertidal communities								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				42	4			881	891		10.1093/icb/42.4.881				AUG 2002	2002	Ecologists and physiologists working on rocky shores have emphasized the effects of environmental stress on the distribution of intertidal organisms. Although consumer stress models suggest that physical extremes may often reduce predation and herbivory through negative impacts on the physiological performance of consumers, few field studies have rigorously tested how environmental variation affects feeding rates. I review and analyze field experiments that quantified per capita feeding rates of a keystone predator, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, in relation to aerial heat stress, wave forces, and water temperature at three rocky intertidal sites on the Oregon coast. Predation rates during 14-day periods were unrelated to aerial temperature, but decreased significantly with decreasing water temperature. There was suggestive but inconclusive evidence that predation rates also declined with increasing wave forces. Data-logger records suggested that thermal stress was rare in the wave-exposed habitats that I studied; sea star body temperatures likely reached warm levels (>24degreesC) on only 9 dates in 3 yr. In contrast, wind-driven upwelling regularly generated 3 to 5degreesC fluctuations in water temperature, and field and laboratory results suggest that such changes significantly alter feeding rates of Pisaster. These physiological rate effects, near the center of an organism's thermal range, may not reduce growth or fitness, and thus are distinct from the effects of environmental stress. This study underscores the need to consider organismal responses both under "normal" conditions, as well as under extreme conditions. Examining both kinds of responses is necessary to understand how different components of environmental variation regulate physiological performance and the strength of species interactions in intertidal communities.

Development time from egg to adult ranged from 22.4 days at 20degreesC to 10.6 days at 35degreesC, and required 278 degree-days above a threshold estimated to be 9.11degreesC. Survival was highest at 25degreesC and lowest at 35degreesC. Longevity of females declined significantly with increasing temperatures, ranging from 120.7 days at 20degreesC to 46.6 days at 35degreesC. Mean generation time became shorter with increasing temperatures. The intrinsic rate of increase of individuals kept at 30degreesC was significantly greater than that of individuals kept at the other temperatures tested.

Searching rate of fourth instar larvae and adults was similar, but handling time was shorter for female adults. Results obtained in this study showed that the optimal temperature for population growth of E. nigmmaculatus was 30degreesC and this coccinellid predator may have potential as a biological control agent for H. pruni because of its feeding capacity.									12	0	0	0	13	0	13			0334-2123			WOS:000178564100002

However, the role of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity in species interactions is poorly understood, leaving a substantial gap in our knowledge of the impacts of global change on ecosystems. Using a cla-doceran-dragonfly system, we experimentally investigated the effects of thermal acclimation, acute temperature change and enrichment on predator functional response and metabolic rate. Using our experimental data, we next parameterized a population dynamics model to determine the consequences of these effects on trophic interaction strength and food-chain stability. We found that (1) predation and metabolic rates of the dragonfly larvae increase with acute warming, (2) warm-acclimated larvae have a higher maximum predation rate than cold-acclimated ones, and (3) long-term interaction strength increases with enrichment but decreases with both acclimation and acute temperatures. Overall, our experimental results show that thermal acclimation can buffer negative impacts of environmental change on predators and increase food-web stability and persistence. We conclude that the effect of acclimation and, more generally, phenotypic plasticity on trophic interactions should not be overlooked if we aim to understand the effects of climate change and enrichment on species interaction strength and food-web stability.									36	0	0	0	32	0	36			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000360998400010	25808556

Some walleye anglers have reported reductions in the quality of walleye fisheries since the introduction of smallmouth bass and attribute this to the consumption of young walleyes by smallmouth bass and competition for shared prey resources. We quantified the diets of walleyes and smallmouth bass in the lower reaches of Lake Sharpe (a Missouri River reservoir), calculated the diet overlap between the two predators, and determined whether they partitioned shared prey based on size. We also quantified walleye diets in the upper reach of the reservoir, which has a different prey base and allowed us to compare the growth rates of walleyes within Lake Sharpe. Age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum composed a substantial proportion of the diets of both predators, regardless of location, for most of the growing season; the patterns in shad vulnerability appeared to drive the observed patterns in diet overlap. Smallmouth bass appeared to consume a smaller size range of gizzard shad than did walleyes, which consumed a wide range. Smallmouth bass consumed Sander spp. in some months, but in very low quantities. Given that global climate change is expected to alter the population and community dynamics in Great Plains reservoirs, we also used a bioenergetics approach to predict the potential effects of limiting prey availability (specifically, the absence of gizzard shad and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax) and increased water temperatures (as projected from global climate change models) on walleye and smallmouth bass growth. The models indicated that the absence of rainbow smelt from the diets of walleyes in upper Lake Sharpe would reduce growth but that the absence of gizzard shad would have a more marked negative effect on both predators at both locations. The models also indicated that higher water temperatures would have an even greater negative influence on walleye growth; however, smallmouth bass growth was predicted to increase with higher temperatures. Fisheries managers should consider strategies to enhance the prey base or mitigate the effects of increased water temperatures that may occur in the future as a result of global climate change. Such proactive actions may alleviate potential future competition between walleyes and smallmouth bass resulting from changes in the fish community.									31	0	0	0	34	0	34			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000277947800011

Tests were performed in microcosms in climate-controlled rooms at five different temperatures. Daphnia magna, a common water flea, served as prey. On ave-rage D. villosus showed the highest consumption rate of Daphnia magna over the entire temperature range, followed in decreasing order by G. pulex, G. roeselii and G. fossarum. The predation rate of all species showed a distinct peak at 20 degrees C. Correction of predation rates for body size gave somewhat different results. D. villosus is then still the most predatory of all gammaridean species tested followed by G. pulex, G. fossarum and G. roeselii. The outcome of the Daphnia tests is consistent with results of other studies with different prey. This supports that the Daphnia test is a good and quick indicator of the predatory abilities in gammaridean species at varying temperatures, and allows the prediction of how changing temperature regimes influence invasion impacts [Current Zoology 57 (6): 836-843, 2011].									13	1	0	0	13	0	13			1674-5507			WOS:000298293800020

Five constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and six host densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64) were used during a 24-h period. At each temperature, 2-64 third-instar nymphs of A. gossypii were exposed to individual wasp mating pairs. A type II functional response model for both parasitoid wasps was fit separately for each temperature. The results showed that instantaneous attack rate (a) in A. colemani increased linearly as the temperature increases from 10 to 30 degrees C, but in A. matricariae, (a) increased almost linearly with temperature to reach a maximum at 25 degrees C, and then decreased at 30 degrees C, displaying an asymmetrical dome-shaped pattern. The highest instantaneous attack rate for A. colemani and A. matricariae were calculated 0.940 +/- 0.144 day(-1) at 30 degrees C and 0.687 +/- 0.157 day(-1) at 25 degrees C, respectively. Handling time (T-h) for A. colemani was inversely proportional to temperature and ranged from 0.093 +/- 0.026 day at 10 degrees C to 0.032 +/- 0.004 day at 30 degrees C, but in A. matricariae, (T-h) was between 0.078 +/- 0.015 day at 10 degrees C and 0.036 +/- 0.014 day at 20 degrees C. A. colemani achieved higher parasitism rate than A. matricariae at higher temperatures. This observation suggests that A. colemani maybe more effective for biological control of the cotton aphid during warmer periods.									64	9	0	0	69	0	81			1612-4758			WOS:000241612200002

The role of temperature in the prey capture probability of drift-feeding juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta)								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				20	3			393	399		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00470.x				SEP 2011	2011	Cold water temperatures are widely supposed to reduce the food intake of stream salmonids. Although cold temperatures have been documented to reduce swimming ability, digestion and gastric evacuation rates, little is known about how temperature influences the ability of fish to capture prey. We examined the effects of water temperature on the prey capture probability of drift-feeding juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a laboratory stream. Temperatures ranged between 5.7 degrees C and 14 degrees C. We found significant effects of water temperature on prey capture probability and capture manoeuvre time. The mean capture probability dropped from 96% at 14 degrees C to 53% at 5.7 degrees C. At 8 degrees C and higher temperatures, foraging performances did not differ much among treatments. We suggest that reduced swimming ability could be one of the most important mechanisms for the observed pattern of reduced prey capture probability at cold water temperatures, but prey detection limitations and predator avoidance may play a role. Our results will be of use for bioenergetics-based drift-foraging models, which to date have not incorporated a temperature-dependent prey capture function.									25	0	0	0	24	0	25			0906-6691			WOS:000293412600009

Natural prey composition was evaluated through correcting the apparent diet (the result of observations of the feeding behavior) by the handling time, which was determined by laboratory analysis. The apparent diet and the natural diet should generally differ because prey items that require a longer handling time will be observed with higher frequencies. Multiple regression equations were derived to relate the handling time to prey size, predator size and water temperature. A large discrepancy in the apparent versus natural diet of M. fusca was found in prey species composition and prey size. They foraged on at least 11 species of sessile and mobile prey including six limpet species, and mainly preyed on Siphonaria spp. and Lottia spp. in the field. By comparing the percentage of the natural diet to that of prey abundance in the field, M. fusca preferred Siphonaria spp. and Lottia spp. and did not select the other prey species. The selectivity of this predator was explained by optimal foraging theory and antipredator defenses of some limpet species. The relationships among attacking methods, handling time and prey selectivity are also examined.									11	0	0	0	9	0	12			0173-9565			WOS:000221230800003

Here, the effect of elevated water temperature and parasite exposure level was tested on parasite prevalence, abundance and burden, and on fish growth, using Pomphorhynchus laevis and its fish host Squalius cephalus. At 60 days post-exposure, prevalence was higher at the elevated temperature (22 degrees C) than ambient temperature (18 degrees C), with infections achieved at considerably lower levels of exposure. Whilst parasite number was significantly higher in infected fish at 22 degrees C, both mean parasite weight and parasite burden was significantly higher at 18 degrees C. There were, however, no significant relationships between fish growth rate and temperature, parasite exposure, and the infection parameters. Thus, whilst elevated temperature significantly influenced parasite infection rates, it also impacted parasite development rates, suggesting warming could have complex implications for parasite dynamics and host resistance.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0031-1820	1469-8161		WOS:000381218800013	27225942	
J	Huryn, Alexander D.; Benstead, Jonathan P.								Seasonal changes in light availability modify the temperature dependence of secondary production in an Arctic stream								ECOLOGY				100	6					e02690	10.1002/ecy.2690				JUN 2019	2019	Light and temperature are key drivers of ecosystem productivity, but synchrony of their annual cycles typically obscures their relative influence. The coupling of annual light-temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69 degrees N, annual water temperature range 4-7 degrees C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light-temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000474127300001	30854634

However, the processes governing early post-arrival mortality are complex and can result in minimum threshold temperatures for overwinter survival, which are greater than those predicted based upon physiological temperature tolerances alone. This 3.5 mo laboratory study monitored the early performance of a tropical damselfish Abudefduf vaigiensis that occurs commonly during austral summer along the SE Australian coast, under nominal summer and winter water temperatures, and compares results with a co-occurring year-round resident of the same family, Parma microlepis. Survivorship, feeding rate, growth and burst swimming ability (as a measure of predator escape ability) were all reduced for the tropical species at winter water temperatures compared to those in summer, whereas the temperate species experienced no mortality and only feeding rate was reduced at colder temperatures. These results suggest that observed minimum threshold survival temperatures may be greater than predicted by physiology alone, due to lowered food intake combined with increased predation risk (a longer time at vulnerable sizes and reduced escape ability). Overwinter survival is a significant hurdle in pole-ward range expansions of tropical fishes, and a better understanding of its complex processes will allow for more accurate predictions of changes in biodiversity as coastal ocean temperatures continue to increase due to climate change.									46	0	0	0	46	1	47			0171-8630			WOS:000267404000019

They also have been shown to attack pest thrips. It is unknown, however, whether phytoseiid mites can reduce high densities of Thrips flavidulus (Bagnall). We addressed this question by the study of functional and numerical responses. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential predation success of the adults of three predatory mites, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans), Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes), and Euseius nicholsi (Ehara & Lee), against the first-instar of T. flavidulus in a climatic chamber at five different temperatures. The results showed that the functional responses of those predators reflected the Holling type II functional response and were density dependent and positively related to temperature. For the three predatory mites, predation and successful attack rates increased with increasing temperature up to 26A degrees C, reducing afterward. Handling time had the opposite trend. Reproductive ability also increased with an increase in temperature and prey consumption.									8	3	0	0	9	0	11			1519-566X	1678-8052		WOS:000342213800007	27193954

Effects of within-season temperature variations on the early life history of two estuarine demersal fishes								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				99	1			79	94		10.1007/s10641-015-0455-8				JAN 2016	2016	Cultured naked goby (Gobiosoma bosc) and striped blenny (Chasmodes bosquianus) larvae were used to compare life history parameters for early and late periods within a long spawning season during which temperature increased by approximately 10 A degrees C. Hatch lengths, growth rates, larval period duration, settlement length, survivorship, and other metrics of these serial spawners were determined for larvae hatched during early and late time periods with ambient average weekly water temperatures of 20.8 (standard deviation +/- 2.1 A degrees C) and 29.0 (+/- 1.0), respectively. Cultured fishes provided parameter estimates in the absence of predation mortality and with constant prey availability. Four hypotheses were tested for each species: 1) total length at hatch is not related to temperature, 2) pelagic larval period (PLD) is negatively related to temperature, 3) growth rates and survivorship are positively related to temperature, and 4) flexion and settlement lengths are negatively related to temperature. For both gobies and blennies, hatch length decreased with increasing temperature, but was not significantly related to survivorship. Larval blennies retained the yolk-sac longer than gobies. At higher temperatures, striped blenny flexion length, settlement length, PLD, and instantaneous mortality significantly decreased while instantaneous growth in length increased. Naked goby flexion lengths, settlement lengths, PLD, and mortality rates also declined with increasing water temperatures while instantaneous growth rates increased with increasing water temperatures. Average growth in length did not change significantly with temperature for either species. Survivorship in both fishes was lowest during 0 to 6 days post hatch (dph) coincident with the yolk-sac and first feeding stages. Survivorship significantly increased with larval fish total length and age (dph) for both species and time periods. Average estimated striped blenny percentage survival increased by an order of magnitude (similar to 3 to similar to 32 %) with increasing temperature while average naked goby percentage survival increased from similar to 3 % (early) to similar to 11 % (late) over the 8.3 A degrees C temperature range examined. The observed life history parameter variation with seasonal temperature changes likely function to ensure survival to settlement for at least some cohorts within a year class as part of a bet-hedging life history strategy. Data from cultured fishes provide a baseline for future evaluation of demographics and rates from field collections.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000366502600008

Improving our understanding of how environmental and ecological factors mechanistically interact and influence larval fish growth and survival is necessary to better predict year-class strength and expected physiological and behavioural responses to climate warming. We use a state-dependent optimality model for the behaviour of larval Atlantic cod Gadus morhua to analyse trade-offs related to growth and survival. Temperature-dependent maximum growth rates and vertical profiles of temperature and stochastic prey availability are used as inputs within a mechanistic modelling framework that finds optimal behavioural strategies of vertical migration and foraging activity. The fitness criterion used is maximization of survival probability until the larvae reach a given body size (15 mm). Detailed descriptions of predation, physiology, growth and survival of larval cod emerge from simulations of the optimal strategies. The model shows that the effect of temperature on survival is complex. Increasing temperature may lead to faster growth and higher survival, but only when there is sufficient food. In poor food environments, higher temperatures make larvae more susceptible to predation as they take higher risks to satisfy their metabolic costs. Overall, these results suggest that larval Atlantic cod, especially those from warmer-water stocks, may experience reduced survival and recruitment in climate-change scenarios that predict both elevated temperatures and reduced food supply.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000356076000015

Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interaction strengths in the short and long term. Additionally, we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation. Together, these results suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects on predator-prey interactions and food-web stability.									214	3	0	0	197	1	216			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000279443800001

We examined the effects of water temperature and food resource gradients on the growth rate of zooplankton undergoing vertical migration in Lake Michigan. In three laboratory experiments, juvenile Daphnia mendotae, native herbivorous cladocerans, were incubated for 5 days at water temperatures associated with the epilimnion and deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) of Lake Michigan and were fed food resources collected directly from these regions. Growth rate strongly depended on water temperature, as Daphnia incubated at the epilimnetic temperature (21 degrees C) grew 42% faster than those at the DCM temperature (8 degrees C). Growth rate of Daphnia that alternated between the two temperatures every 12 h (0.108 day(-1)) was similar to the arithmetic average growth rate of the two water temperature treatment extremes (0.110 day(-1)), suggesting fluctuating temperatures alone do not substantially influence Daphnia growth. In contrast, food resources derived from different depths did not affect growth rate, nor was there a significant interaction between food resource origin and water temperature effects. Our results indicate that vertical migration will reduce growth rate, and hence zooplankton production, through reduced temperature, not from changes in resources. Consideration of the effects of vertical migration, especially given the known variability in this behavior, may substantially improve zooplankton production estimates in the Great Lakes.

Model analyses show that the stability of population dynamics and food web persistence increase with the strength of interference competition. Despite this critical importance for community stability, little is known about how external factors such as the environmental temperature affect intraspecific interference competition.2. We aimed to fill this void by studying the functional responses of two ground beetle species of different body size, Pterostichus melanarius and Poecilus versicolor. These functional response experiments were replicated across four predator densities and two temperatures to address the impact of temperature on intraspecific interference competition.3. We generally expected that warming should increase the speed of movement, encounter rates and in consequence interference among predator individuals. In our experiment, this expectation was supported by the results obtained for the larger predator, P. melanarius, whereas the opposite pattern characterized the interference behaviour of the smaller predator P. versicolor.4. These results suggest potentially nontrivial implications for the effects of environmental temperature on intraspecific interference competition, for which we propose an explanation based on the different sensitivity to warming of metabolic rates of both species. As expected, increasing temperature led to stronger interference competition of the larger species, P. melanarius, which exhibited a weaker increase in metabolic rate with increasing temperature. The stronger increase in the metabolic rate of the smaller predator, P. versicolor, had to be compensated by increasing searching activity for prey, which did not leave time for increasing interference.5. Together, these results suggest that any generalization how interference competition responds to warming should also take the species' metabolic response to temperature increases into account.									57	1	0	0	55	1	58			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000302613300002	22112157

Here we establish a phenological model for Daphnia, an aquatic keystone herbivore based on decadal data on water temperatures and the timing of Daphnia population maxima from Lake Constance, a large European lake. We tested this model with long-term time-series data from two lakes (Muggelsee, Germany; Lake Washington, USA), and with observations from a diverse set of 49 lakes/sites distributed widely across the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The model successfully captured the observed temporal variation of Daphnia phenology in the two case study sites (r(2) = 0.25 and 0.39 for Muggelsee and Lake Washington, respectively) and large-scale spatial variation in the NH (R-2 = 0.57). These results suggest that Daphnia phenology follows a uniform temperature dependency in NH lakes. Our approach - based on temperature phenologies - has large potential to study and predict phenologies of animal and plant populations across large latitudinal gradients in other ecosystems.									15	0	0	0	10	0	15			1932-6203			WOS:000309827300011	23071520

Each dinoflagellate species grows well at a certain optimal temperature but dies at very cold and hot temperatures. Thus, changes in water temperatures driven by global warming and extremely high or low temperatures can affect the distribution of dinoflagellates. Yihiella yeosuensis is a mixotrophic dinoflagellate that can feed on only the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia and the chlorophyte Pyramimonas sp. Furthermore, it grows fast mixotrophically but rarely grows photosynthetically. We explored the direct and indirect effects of water temperature on the growth and ingestion rates of Y. yeosuensis feeding on T. amphioxeia and the growth rates of T. amphioxeia and Pyramimonas sp. under 7 different water temperatures (535 degrees C). Both the autotrophic and mixotrophic growth rates of Y. yeosuensis on T. amphioxeia were significantly affected by temperature. Under the mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions, Y. yeosuensis survived at 10-25 degrees C, but died at 5 degrees C and >= 30 degrees C. The maximum mixotrophic growth rate of Y. yeosuensis on T. amphioxeia (1.16 d(-1)) was achieved at 25 degrees C, whereas the maximum autotrophic growth rate (0.16 d(-1)) was achieved at 15 degrees C. The maximum ingestion rate of Y. yeosuensis on T. amphioxeia (0.24 ng C predator(-1) d(-1)) was achieved at 25 degrees C. The cells of T. amplitoxela survived at 10-25 degrees C, but died at 5 and >= 30 degrees C. The cells of Pyramimonas sp. survived at 5-25 degrees C, but died at 30 degrees C. The maximum growth rate of T. amphioxeia (0.72 d(-1)) and Pyramimonas sp. (0.75 d(-1)) was achieved at 25 degrees C. The abundance of Y. yeosuensis is expected to be high at 25 degrees C, at which its two prey species have their highest growth rates, whereas Y. yeosuensis is expected to be rare or absent at 5 degrees C or >= 30 degrees C at which its two prey species do not survive or grow. Therefore, temperature can directly or indirectly affect the population dynamics and distribution of Y. yeosuensis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-2617	2093-0860		WOS:000574269300005		
J	Logan, J. David; Wolesensky, Wilmam								Accounting for temperature in predator functional responses								NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING				20	4			549	574						WIN 2007	2007	A rational mechanism that integrates temperature-mediated activity cycles into standard predator functional responses is presented. Daily temperature variations strongly influence times that predators can search for prey, and they affect the activity periods of prey, thereby modifying their detection by predators. Thus, key parameters in the functional response, the search time and the detection, become temperature-dependent. These temperature mediated responses are included in discrete-time population growth models, and it is shown how environmental temperature variations, such as those that may occur under global climate change, can affect population levels. As an illustration, a logistic growth model with a stochastic, temperature-dependent predation term is examined, and the response to both average temperature levels and temperature variability is quantified. We infer, through simulations, that predation and prey abundance are strongly affected by mean temperature, temperature amplitudes, and increasing uncertainty in predicting temperature levels and variation, thus confirming many qualitative conclusions in the ecological literature. In particular, we show that increased temperature variability increases oscillations in the system and leads to increased probability of extinction of the prey.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0890-8575	1939-7445		WOS:000251341200003

This paper develops a temperature-dependent, stage-based, discrete, cohort model of the population dynamics of an insect pest under pressure from a predator. Guided by experimental data, the model is applied specifically to predation of grasshoppers by rangeland lycosid spiders. The development rate of insect arthropods is strongly affected by temperature, and these temperature-dependent phenological effects couple with shifts in the daily activity periods for both prey and predator, thereby increasing or decreasing opportunities for interaction. The model addresses these effects quantitatively by introducing a temperature-dependent, joint-activity factor that enters the predator's functional response. The model also includes a prey mortality rate that is temperature-dependent through the prey development rate. The model is parameterized using field and experimental data for spiders and grasshoppers. We investigate the effect of the solar power index (sunlight), mean temperature, and temperature variation, as measured by amplitude, on the developmental times and survivorship, both with, and without, predation. We conclude that increasing variation in temperature results in a stronger relative effect on survivorship due to predation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was examined in petri dish arenas containing sweet pepper leaves infested with different densities of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The predator showed a type II functional response at three tested temperatures ranging from 19A degrees C to 27A degrees C. The theoretical maximum number of prey captured by the predator increased with temperature. Based on the random predator equation, the estimated attack rates ranged from 0.13 h(-1) at 19A degrees C to 0.35 h(-1) at 27A degrees C on a leaf area of 20-25 cm(2). There was no significant difference between the attack rates of the predator at 23A degrees C and 27A degrees C. Handling time significantly decreased as temperature increased from 19A degrees C (0.39 h) to 27A degrees C (0.24 h). This study shows that A. bipunctata displays high predation rates on M. persicae for a wide range of temperatures, indicating its potential for augmentative releases against this aphid pest. The limitations of the predictions generated by functional response experiments are discussed.									54	5	0	0	52	0	60			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000275536500006		
J	Velasco, L. A.								Effect of microalgal concentration and water temperature on the physiology of the Caribbean scallops Argopecten nucleus and Nodipecten nodosus								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				25	3			823	831						DEC 2006	2006	Argopecten nucleus and Nodipecten nodosus are two Caribbean scallops occurring in Colombia, which have recently been selected for artificial culture based on their high commercial value. As part of an effort to develop culture technology for these species, we studied the effects of food concentration and temperature on feeding rates (filtration, ingestion, and absorption), oxygen consumption, ammonium excretion and scope for growth in adults of the two scallop species. We tested the effects of four concentrations of the microalga Isochrysis galbana (10, 20, 40 and 60 cells mu L-1) at three water temperatures (20, 25 and 28 degrees C), at a constant salinity of 36 parts per thousand. The results showed that increases in food concentration induced increases in feeding rate, oxygen consumption and growth potential, but at values of 60 cells mu L-1 these variables decreased, indicating saturation of the digestive tract. The excretion rate increased at low food concentrations, particularly at the middle (25 degrees C) and/or at the highest temperature tested (28 degrees C). This suggested utilization of endogenous proteins as a supplementary energy source under these conditions. The increase in temperature had no significant effect on the feeding variables or on the scope for growth of A. nucleus, but raised the N. nodosus ones. All the physiological rates for the two species were similar except for oxygen consumption, which was greater in N. nodosus than in A. nucleus. Using values obtained for the algae concentrations, which produced the greatest growth potential. the optimal value for I. galballa for both the scallops was 40 cells mu L-1, whereas the optimal temperature for N. nodosus was 25 degrees C. There was no single optimal temperature for A. nucleus. which functioned equally well at between 20 degrees C and 28 degrees C.									12	0	0	0	12	3	14			0730-8000			WOS:000242839700004

In the 1980s, the lake's trophic state proceeded from oligotrophic to mesotrophic, which favoured cyprinids. The increased cyprinid density strengthened the competition pressure on perch (Perca fluviatilis) reducing the growth rates of young perch. The lake's trophic state shifted from mesotrophic back to oligotrophic in the 1990s as a result of effective treatment of sewage waters. The water temperature in Lake Pyhaselka rose from the beginning to the end of the monitoring period. The higher temperature favoured perch. In future, the warming may benefit pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) even more than perch. This will probably affect the perch population, as pikeperch prey effectively on perch.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1961-9502			WOS:000280888900003

In this study we analyse how offspring fitness constrains spawning phenology in a large migratory apex predator, the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The reproductive schedule of Atlantic bluefin tuna varies between spawning sites, suggesting plasticity to local environmental conditions. Generally, temperature is considered to be the main constraint on tuna spawning phenology. We combine evidence from long-term field data, temperature-controlled rearing experiments on eggs and larvae, and a model of egg fitness, and show that Atlantic bluefin tuna do not spawn to optimize egg and larval temperature exposure. The timing of spawning leads to temperature exposure considerably lower than optimal at all spawning grounds across the Atlantic Ocean. The early spawning is constrained by thermal inhibition of egg hatching and larval growth rates, but some other factors must prevent later spawning. Matching offspring with ocean productivity and the prey peak might be an important driver for bluefin tuna spawning phenology. This finding is important for predictions of reproductive timing in future climate warming scenarios for bluefin tuna.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000419973000001	29321292	
J	Bonaviri, Chiara; Graham, Michael; Gianguzza, Paola; Shears, Nick T.								Warmer temperatures reduce the influence of an important keystone predator								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				86	3			490	500		10.1111/1365-2656.12634				MAY 2017	2017	Predator-prey interactions may be strongly influenced by temperature variations in marine ecosystems. Consequently, climate change may alter the importance of predators with repercussions for ecosystem functioning and structure. In North-eastern Pacific kelp forests, the starfish Pycnopodia helianthoides is known to be an important predator of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Here we investigated the influence of water temperature on this predator-prey interaction by: (i) assessing the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of both species across a temperature gradient in the northern Channel Islands, California, and (ii) investigating how the feeding rate of P.helianthoides on S.purpuratus is affected by temperature in laboratory tests. On average, at sites where mean annual temperatures were <14 degrees C, P.helianthoides were common, S.purpuratus was rare and kelp was persistent, whereas where mean annual temperatures exceeded 14 degrees C, P.helianthoides and kelp were rare and S.purpuratus abundant. Temperature was found to be the primary environmental factor influencing P.helianthoides abundance, and in turn P.helianthoides was the primary determinant of S.purpuratus abundance. In the laboratory, temperatures >16 degrees C (equivalent to summer temperatures at sites where P.helianthoides were rare) reduced predation rates regardless of predator and prey sizes, although larger sea urchins were consumed only by large starfishes. These results clearly demonstrate that the effect of P.helianthoides on S.purpuratus is strongly mediated by temperature, and that the local abundance and predation rate of P.helianthoides on sea urchins will likely decrease with future warming. A reduction in top-down control on sea urchins, combined with other expected impacts of climate change on kelp, poses significant risks for the persistence of kelp forests in the future.									12	1	0	0	10	0	12			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000398826400009	28075025

A bioenergetics model for humpback chub was developed and used to examine how warmer water temperatures in the lower Colorado River (achieved through a temperature control device [TCD] at Glen Canyon Dam) might influence their growth rate and food requirements. Parameter values for humpback chub were developed by Monte Carlo filtering and fitting to laboratory growth. Parameter bounds were established from the literature for Gila species, random parameter sets were selected within these bounds, and the growth of modeled humpback chub was compared with criteria from a laboratory growth experiment at 24 degrees C. This method of parameter estimation could be applied to other imperiled fishes where physiological studies are impractical. Final parameter values were corroborated by comparison with the growth rates of humpback chub from independent field and laboratory studies. Simulations indicated that increasing water temperatures from approximately 9 degrees C to 16 degrees C during summer and fall, the change expected from the TCD, may have a minimal effect on humpback chub growth rate unless food availability also increases with temperature. To evaluate the effects of increased temperatures on humpback chub in the lower Colorado River, it will be essential to monitor their growth rate, the invertebrate community, and the predators of humpback chub, which are also influenced by temperature changes. Bioenergetics models for humpback chub and their predators should be helpful tools for identifying potential scenarios and evaluating the complex interactions resulting from a TCD.									32	0	0	0	32	0	32			0002-8487			WOS:000230411700015

Temperature regimes experienced by both female and male adult walleye in three basins of Lake Huron and in Lake Erie were determined by use of surgically implanted temperature loggers and acoustic telemetry. Temperatures experienced by walleye were higher in Lake Erie than in Lake Huron. Walleye from Lake Erie grew at nearly double the rate of walleye from Lake Huron, and mass at age for adult females averaged about 50% greater than that for adult males in both lakes. Food consumption rate for an average adult walleye in Lake Erie was nearly twice as high as that in Lake Huron. Interbasin and interlake variability in temperature regimes accounted for a moderate degree of variability in walleye growth. We concluded that the driver for faster growth in lake Erie compared with Lake Huron was higher food availability in Lake Erie compared with Lake Huron. The sex difference in temperature regimes explained 15% of the sex difference in Lake Erie walleye growth.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000445358100002

However, recent studies indicate that ambient communities can lower disease risk for hosts, for instance via predation on free-living stages of parasites (predation effect). Since general physiological theory suggests predation effects to be temperature-dependent, we hypothesized that increases in temperature may lead to reduced parasite infectivity via elevated consumption rates of free-living parasite stages (temperature-predation interaction). We experimentally investigated such interactions in three marine predators of infective parasite stages. Two species (the oyster Crassostrea gigas, and the barnacle Austrominius modestus) significantly reduced cercarial stages of the trematode Renicola roscovita in mussel hosts (Mytilus edulis), while the third (the crab Hemigrapsus takanoi) did not show a reduction of infective stages at all. In barnacles, cercarial consumption significantly interacted with temperature, with lowest infectivity at highest temperatures. Since these patterns reflected the known thermal responses of the three cercarial predators' feeding rates, parasite consumption rates may be predictable from temperature dependent feeding rates. Our results suggest that integrating temperature-predation interactions into studies on parasite transmission and on climate change effects is essential and that predators of free-living stages of parasites may play an important role in indirectly mediating disease risk under climate change.									22	0	0	0	18	0	23			2150-8925			WOS:000358433300008

Using a common garden experiment, we examined temperature-specific growth and survival responses of larvae among populations of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) from four regions of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Fish larvae from the four regions differed significantly in their growth and survival responses at high water temperatures 26 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, survival rates of larvae by Day 20 ranged from 0% in the Lachlan region to 82% in the southern region. Opposite to the geographical differences in survival, growth of larvae was highest in the Lachlan (14.8-15.4-mm standard length 95% CI) and lowest in the southern region (13.4-13.9-mm standard length 95% CI) at 26 degrees C where sufficient numbers survived for comparison. Geographical differences in growth and survival responses did not follow a consistent latitudinal gradient as observed for other species, but were closely linked with previously described genetic structure. Our results suggest that the upper thermal limit of M. peelii larvae is near common river temperatures in the MDB and that maintaining functional response diversity and underlying genetic diversity will be important for ensuring the resilience of this apex predator under future climate change.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000462534200001

Seasonal Patterns in White Crappies' Consumption and Growth: Influences of Varying Water Temperatures and Prey Availability								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				141	3			681	696		10.1080/00028487.2012.675898				2012	2012	Crappies Pomoxis spp. are popular sport fishes but often fail to achieve sizes that are acceptable to anglers. While many factors may contribute to episodes of suboptimal growth in crappies, insufficient densities of prey fish and high summer water temperatures (>27 degrees C) have been considered to be key underlying causes. We examined the influences of prey fish size, prey availability, and water temperature on the consumption and growth of white crappies P. annularis (ages 1-3) in three Missouri reservoirs over five successive years. Monthly growth rates were estimated using aging analyses, while consumption was estimated using a bioenergetics model. All age-groups grew fastest in the reservoir that was warmest but in which prey fish availability was the highest. Diet analyses coupled with bioenergetics modeling suggested that white crappies were able to maintain positive growth rates at temperatures exceeding 27 degrees C by maximizing consumption rates when adequate prey fish resources were available. When sufficient prey fish resources were unavailable, white crappies fed on invertebrates and often ceased growing or lost weight, even during periods with suitable water temperatures. Our study documents the importance of adequate prey fish resources for maintaining positive growth rates of white crappies, especially during periods of adverse temperature conditions.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000306462100012

To our knowledge, there is. very little information on the potential effects of both combined stressors on marine grazer-seaweed interactions. Here, we evaluated, for the first time several phenotypic responses (e.g periwinkle survival, condition index, consumption rates, seaweed photosynthetic activity and oxidative stress) of the temperate periwinkle Littorina obtusata (grazer) and the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (prey) to such climate change-related variables, for 15 days. Increased temperature (22 degrees C, pH 8.0) elicited a significant lethal effect on the periwinkle within a short-term period (mortality rate > 90%). Acidification condition (18 degrees C, pH 7.6) was the one that showed lower mortality rates (approximate to 20%) reflected by lower impact on periwinkle fitness and consumption rates. Under a scenario of increased temperature and lowered pH the antioxidant defences of L. obtusata seemed to be supressed increasing the risk of peroxidative damage. The seaweed evidenced signs of cellular damage under such conditions. These results suggest that: i) lower pH per se seems to benefit the interaction between grazer and seaweed while, ii) a combined scenario of increased temperature and lowered pH may be negative for the interaction, due to the unbalance between periwinkle mortality rates and consumption rates. But most importantly, since grazing often plays an important role on structuring natural communities, such predator-prey disturbances can elicit cascading effects on the remaining community structure and functioning of the temperate rocky-shore ecosystems.

Through this mechanism, environmental temperature affects individuals and populations of poikilotherms by determining rates of resource use, growth, reproduction, and mortality. Predictable variation in metabolic processes such as growth and reproduction could affect the strength of species interactions, but the community-level consequences of metabolic temperature dependence are virtually unexplored. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that plant herbivore interaction strength increases with temperature using a common species of marine macroalga (Sargassum filipendula) and the grazing amphipod Ampithoe longimana. Increasing temperature increased per capita interaction strength in two independent experiments and reversed a positive effect of temperature on plant growth. Temperature did not alter palatability of plant tissue to herbivores or average herbivore feeding rate. A predictable effect of temperature on herbivore-plant interaction strength could provide key information toward understanding local food web responses to changing temperatures at different spatial and temporal scales. Efforts to extend the effects of physiological mechanisms to larger scale patterns, including projections of the ecological effects of climate change, must be expanded to include the effects of changing conditions on trophic interactions.									198	1	0	0	186	0	199			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000263570800014	19323223

Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns will also remobilize and modify chemical partitioning. Holding millions of cubic yards of sediments contaminated with persistent legacy chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, the Laurentian Great Lakes are a laboratory for observing interactions between biological and chemical responses to climate change. They provide a wide range of habitat to a variety of species, from littoral forage fish to deep-water predators. In this paper, we couple bioenergetic and bioaccumulation models to investigate the biological and chemical effects of climate change in the Great Lakes. We consider three species: round goby, a warm-water invasive forage fish; mottled sculpin, a cool-water native forage fish; and lake trout, a cold-water native predator. Using our coupled models, we calculate the accumulation of a representative persistent chemical, PCB-77, under four climate scenarios for Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Predator-prey (lake trout-round goby) interactions and food availability (high-low) are incorporated into our simulations. For cool- to cold-water species (sculpin, lake trout) we find that warm temperatures limit growth. For warm-water species (round goby) cold temperatures limit growth. The impact of climate warming on growth depends on the winter lows as well as the summer highs of the scenario, in combination with the species' critical upper and lower thermal limits. We find conditions for high growth and consumption rates generally lead to high bioaccumulation. However, this can be confounded by predator-prey dynamics, as mismatches in the temperature preferences of predator and prey can lead to mismatches in relative growth and uptake rates. As predator-prey dynamics are expected to undergo substantial shifts with changing climate, these relative thermal sensitivities will be key in determining the implications of climate change for bioaccumulation, particularly in top predator species.									24	0	0	0	20	0	24			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000285878000007

Mesocyclops pehpeiensis showed preferences for B. havanaensis, B. rubens and M. macrocopa when offered mixed rotifer and cladoceran species. Functional response curves showed increased consumption with increasing density of B. rubens in the medium until about 160 ind. 40 ml(1) of prey, and thereafter reached an asymptote. In general, regardless of water temperature, prey consumption was higher in the absence of algae in the medium. Consumption was highest at 35 degrees C and declined with decreasing temperatures. Ingestion rates of the alga and cyanobacterium showed maxima at 25 degrees C. Our results also indicated that M. pehpeiensis is an omnivore, consuming phytoplankton and zooplankton.									12	0	0	0	13	0	13			0022-2933	1464-5262		WOS:000316104500030

We measured how changes in body size affect the trophic relationship between the sea star Pisaster ochraceus and its prey, the mussel Mytilus trossulus. We tested the effects of a wide range of predator and prey sizes on sea stars' prey-size preference, feeding rate, and prey tissue consumption. We found that preferred prey size increased with sea star size. Pisaster consumption rate (mussels consumed per day) and tissue intake rate (grams of tissue consumed per day) also increased with sea star size. Pisaster consumption rate, but not tissue intake rate, decreased with increasing mussel size. Juvenile sea stars preferred the most profitable prey sizes-that is, those that maximized tissue consumed per unit handling time. When adult sea stars were offered larger, more profitable mussels, tissue intake rates (grams per day) tended to increase, although this relationship was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that the Pisaster-Mytilus interaction depends on the sizes of both predator and prey, that predation rates are sensitive to even small changes in body size, and that shifts in size distributions may affect predator energetics and prey numbers differently depending on the factors that limit tissue consumption rates.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000357026300003	26124446

Larval development and consumption of second instar cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) increased linearly with constant temperatures between 10-30degreesC. Under fluctuating daily temperatures (10-25degreesC), development and consumption rates were equivalent to those found at a constant 25degreesC. Larvae consumed more aphids during later instars and a maximum consumption rate of approximately 10 aphids per day was recorded. Some aspects of larval behaviour are described.					54th Annual Conference of the New-Zealand-Plant-Protection-Society54th Annual Conference of the New-Zealand-Plant-Protection-Society	AUG 14-16, 2001AUG 14-16, 2001	New Zealand Plant Protect SocNew Zealand Plant Protect Soc	PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALANDPALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND	3	0	0	0	5	0	6			1175-9003		*************	WOS:000177719600048

Higher temperatures are expected to induce an increase in predation rates. However, little is known on how temperature influences close-range encounter of prey-predator interactions, such as predator's attack velocities. Based on the speed-accuracy trade-off concept, we hypothesized that the increase in predator attack velocity by increasing temperature reduces the accuracy of the attack, leading to a lower probability of capture. We tested this hypothesis on the dragonfly larvae Anax imperator and the zooplankton prey Daphnia magna. The prey-predator encounters were video-recorded at high speed, and at three different temperatures. Overall, we found that (1) temperature had a strong effect on predator's attack velocities, (2) prey did not have the opportunity to move and/or escape due to the high velocity of the predator during the attack, and (3) neither velocity nor temperature had significant effects on the capture success. By contrast, the capture success mainly depended on the accuracy of the predator in capturing the prey. We found that (4) some 40% of mistakes were undershooting and some 60% aimed below or above the target. No lateral mistake was observed. These results did not support the speed-accuracy trade-off hypothesis. Further studies on dragonfly larvae with different morphological labial masks and speeds of attacks, as well as on prey with different escape strategies, would provide new insights into the response to environmental changes in prey-predator interactions.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2045-7758			WOS:000430807200042	29721299

Warmer water temperatures will influence the intensity and nature of biotic interactions, including parasitism. To better understand the factors influencing a neascus-type parasitic infection known as black spot disease, we examined the relationship between infection rate in juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), abundance of another intermediate host (ramshorn snail, Planorbella trivolvis), and water temperature. We quantified infection patterns of trout at seven sites within the South Fork Eel River in northern California, visiting each site on three different occasions across the summer, and recording water temperature at each site. We also quantified infection patterns in trout captured from two tributaries to the South Fork Eel River. Overall, trout infection rates were highest in sites with the warmest temperatures. The abundance of ramshorn snails was positively related to both water temperature and black spot infection rates in juvenile trout. Both snail abundance and infection rates increased rapidly above a 23 A degrees C daily maximum, suggesting a threshold effect at this temperature. We suggest that warmer temperatures are associated with environmental and biotic conditions that increase black spot disease prevalence in threatened steelhead trout. A comparison of our results with similar data collected from a more northern latitude suggests that salmonids in California may be warm-adapted in terms of their parasite susceptibility.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000401455000009

Food organisms used in this experiments were Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros didymus and Prorocentrum dentatum. The size of mussels inhabiting higher midlittoral zone was smaller than those of lower midlittoral zone. Regardless of the kind of food organisms, filtration rates and ingestion rates of higher midlittoral mussels were higher than those of lower midlittoral mussels in experiment temperature conditions. The variation of filtration rate and ingestion rate showed same tendency with temperature. Filtration rates and ingestion rates increased with temperature, and recorded maximum values at 20-25℃ of temperature, and thereafter decreased gradually. Theoretical optimum temperatures showing maximum filtration rates and ingestion rates estimated from polynomial regression curves were also in the range of 20-25℃. Blue mussels showed different variation of filtration rate and ingestion rate with the kind of food organisms. Filtration rates and ingestion rate based on cell number were similar regardless of habitat location(tidal elevation) and food organisms. Ingestion rates based on carbon content showed very high values in case of P. dentatum beside I. galbana and C. didymus as food organism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-3480			KJD:ART002032592

During a 6-year monitoring period, we studied the dynamics and population demographic characteristics of the newly introduced mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii. The overall abundance of R. harrisii appeared to follow the boom and bust pattern with a rapid initial abundance increase and subsequent decline. The recruitment and growth of juveniles were correlated with the temperature during the larval period indicating that the increase in water temperature caused by climate change could have a positive effect on the recruitment and have potentially facilitated the establishment of R. harrisii in the northern Baltic Sea. The changes in the survival of reproductive females influence most the growth rate of the studied population. Hence, native predators feeding on benthic fauna such as fish could regulate the population growth of R. harrisii in the study area by reducing female survival. Although the population size seems to be stabilized at the monitoring locations, R. harrisii continues to expand its distribution range, and the rapid initial population increase is likely occurring at newly invaded sites.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000448688100021

Warming drives higher rates of prey consumption and increases rates of intraguild predation								OECOLOGIA				187	3			585	596		10.1007/s00442-018-4146-y				JUL 2018	2018	Warming due to climate change is expected to alter species interactions. These interactions are shaped by components of individual behavior, particularly foraging behaviors. However, few studies consider species' behavioral responses to warming to predict how species interactions will be affected by warming. We chose two complementary approaches to examine how climate warming may affect the behavior and interactions of aquatic intraguild predators. First, we measured behavioral responses to warming in six larval dragonfly species, expecting that feeding rate and activity would increase with temperature. Secondly, we conducted intraguild predation (IGP) trials with three species to understand how temperature affects IGP, and if species' behavioral responses to warming are indicative of the outcome of IGP interactions. Warming increased feeding rates by 42% on average across species but had no effect on activity rate. The magnitude of change in feeding rate was positively correlated with the maximum temperatures species experience across their ranges. Lastly, warming increased rates of IGP twofold, however, species' behavioral responses alone were not predictive of their susceptibility to become IG prey of other larvae at warmer temperatures. Our results provide evidence that IGP interactions may be greatly affected by future increases in temperature; however, activity responses to warming alone are weak predictors of the outcomes of these interactions. Future studies should consider other species' traits when forecasting the effects of climate change on species interactions.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000436242000002	29687229

Increases in the abundance of boring sponges that bioerode the calcified shells of oysters and other shelled organisrns have been attributed to increased salinization of estuarine ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that fouling by boring sponges will change the interaction strength between oysters and a common predator (stone crabs). We generated five oyster density treatments crossed with two sponge treatments (sponge and no sponge). We contrasted the interaction strength between stone crabs and fouled and non-fouled oysters by comparing the parameters of fitted functional response curves based on Rogers random predation model. We found that fouled oysters suffered higher predation from stone crabs, and that the increased predation risk stemmed from a reduction in the handling time needed to consume the fouled oysters. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the effects of abiotic changes on both the composition of ecological communities, and on the strengths of direct and indirect interactions among species. Global climate change is altering local ecosystems in complex ways, and the success of restoration, management, and mitigation strategies for important species requires a better appreciation for how these effects cascade through ecosystems.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2167-8359			WOS:000413260600003	29062602

Lobsters were fed on mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis during a period of 284 days. The activities of the lobsters fluctuated markedly throughout the present study, reflected their molting cycles as well as changes in water temperature. Molting occurred in summer and autumn. Lobsters showed low feed intake for about one month prior to molting, did not feed for 5-17 days just before molting, and resumed feeding 2-26 days after ecdysis. The feed intake of the lobsters increased rapidly in summer following ecdysis. When water temperature was lower than 11.8degreesC, lobsters did not ingest prey. Feed intake increased as water temperature increased, and decreased when water temperature reached 28degreesC or higher.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0021-5392	1349-998X		WOS:000185161200006

Especially agricultural systems are strongly affected by climate change due to low vegetation cover associated with high temperatures and drought. Nevertheless, the response of soil systems to climate change is little explored. We used microcosms with a simplified soil community to address effects of climate change using independent temperature and dryness gradients and addressed their effects on top-down control and litter decomposition. The community consisted of maize litter as a basal resource, fungi, springtails and as top predators mites and centipedes. As the body-size structure is of high importance for communities, we included differently-sized springtails and predator species. After seven weeks, the experiment was terminated, and the impact of climate change on direct feeding interactions and indirect effects across trophic levels was analysed. With increasing temperature and dryness, consumption rates increased, thereby amplifying the negative influence of consumer populations on their resources. Hence, these climate-change variables increased the top-down control of 1) predators (mainly mites) on springtails and 2) fungi on litter decomposition. In addition, we found that the climate-change variables strengthened trophic cascades from predators on fungi whose density was thus increasingly decoupled from top-down control by their springtail consumers. Their increased decomposition rates are of high importance for carbon cycling and may result in accelerated nutrient turnover. In conclusion, our results suggest that climate change may strongly influence the structure and functioning of soil systems by strengthening consumption rates and trophic cascades, which will have far reaching consequences for the nutrient turnover and productivity of agricultural ecosystems.									24	1	0	0	19	0	24			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000342754100008

INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND CONGENER PRESENCE ON HABITAT PREFERENCE AND FISH PREDATION IN BLUE (PARALITHODES PLATYPUS BRANDT, 1850) AND RED (P.

The Pribilof Islands stock of the blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus Brandt, 1850) in Alaska, USA is one of these recovery failures. To explore how environmental and ecological factors might interact to suppress this stock, we conducted a suite of laboratory experiments to assess the effects of temperature changes and the presence of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus Tilesius, 1815) on blue king crab habitat preference and fish predation survival. Age-0 blue king crabs exhibited plasticity in habitat preference mediated by changes in water temperature, as well as the presence and density of juvenile red king crabs. While blue king crabs are often associated with shell hash habitat, increases in water temperature, as well as the presence of red king crab at high densities, caused blue king crab juveniles to shift into habitats with an algal mimic present, a habitat type shown to reduce the predation efficacy of red king crabs. In contrast, red king crabs exhibited fewer changes in habitat preference with changes in water temperature and the presence of a congener. Blue king crabs are therefore behaviorally plastic, switching from strategies of predator avoidance when predator encounter rates are likely low, to predator deterrence strategies when encounter rates are higher. Fish predation trials further support the idea that blue king crabs are more focused on predator avoidance than are red king crabs. In fish predation trials run separately for the two crab species, blue king crabs had higher survival (60%) than red king crabs (33%) when exposed to fish predators. Our results indicate that age -0 blue king crabs can be less vulnerable to fish predation than red king crabs, but future research should assess how fish predation rates change when presented with higher densities of red and blue king crab in mixed assemblages as the observed habitat shifts could affect predation survival.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0278-0372	1937-240X		WOS:000371753400002

Our aim was to disentangle the roles and relevancies of different pressures in shaping fish communities in small streams of the Po plain (North Italy). Long term trend (1998-2018) of functional diversity of 31 fish communities was assessed and modeled in respect to three potential pressures: temperature increase, intensity of exotic fish invasion, and habitat quality degradation. Ecological traits mostly influenced by the pressures were also identified. Reduction of functional richness mostly due to local extinction or contraction of cold adapted predators, such as salmonids, was linked to increasing temperatures. Warming probably also led to a shift of generalist and dominant species, which became more abundant in streams hosting mixed communities of salmonids and cyprinids, and determined the increase of functional dispersion and uniqueness. Reduction of functional redundancy and increasing functional dispersion were both also related to the introduction of new ecological traits brought by expanding exotic species. Low functional overlap was found among native and exotic species, indicating that the invasion process was mainly controlled by competitive interactions and/or resource opportunism. Functional response to habitat quality was not clearly evident. In conclusion, the impact of temperature increase and exotic species on fish functional diversity was effective, idiosyncratic and mediated by the scale of analysis and by the intensity of pressures.

J	Ryer, Clifford H.; Ottmar, Michele; Spencer, Mara; Anderson, Janet Duffy; Cooper, Daniel								TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT GROWTH OF EARLY JUVENILE SOUTHERN TANNER CRAB CHIONOECETES BAIRDI: IMPLICATIONS FOR COLD POOL EFFECTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN BERING SEA								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				35	1			259	267		10.2983/035.035.0128				APR 2016	2016	Temperature strongly influences the growth of crustaceans and directly controls distribution. Despite being commercially important, there are no data on temperature effects upon growth in newly settled southern Tanner crab Chionoecetes bairdi. Recently settled crabs were reared through three consecutive molts, both individually and in groups, at four different temperatures; 2 degrees C, 6 degrees C, 9 degrees C, and 12 degrees C. Survival was higher for crabs grown individually (92%) than those in groups (66%) owing to cannibalism, particularly during molting. There were no temperature effects on survival. Growth rate (mm/day) increased linearly with temperature, a product of exponential decline in intermolt period with increasing temperature and a molt increment that was relatively constant across temperatures. Growth rate, intermolt period, and growth increment did not differ between crabs grown singly or in groups. These data suggest that growth in 0 y aged southern Tanner crabs is strongly inhibited at temperatures less than 2 degrees C. A small mesh beam trawl survey was conducted in the southeast Bering Sea during September 2012, a year when a cold pool (<2 degrees C bottom water) dominated the middle shelf. Southern Tanner crab less than 12mm(carapace width) were concentrated just north of the Alaska Peninsula and along the outer shelf where bottom water was more than 2 degrees C, but largely absent from the middle shelf. In contrast, adult southern Tanner crabs were widely distributed across the middle and outer shelves. It was hypothesized that early juvenile southern Tanner growth is inhibited by cold pool conditions, prolonging vulnerability to predation, and reducing survival. In the future, if sea temperature rises and sea ice is diminished, less frequent and less intense cold pool events may lead to increased persistence of thermally suitable juvenile southern Tanner crab habitat across the southeastern Bering Sea middle shelf region.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000376743800028

However, projections of climate impacts will require a better mechanistic understanding of ecological and behavioral responses to climate change and climate variation. For vertebrate animals, there is an absence of whole-system manipulative experiments that express natural variation in predator and prey behaviors. Here we investigate the effect of elevated water temperature on the physiology, behavior, growth, and survival of fish populations in a multiple whole-lake experiment, by using 17 lake-years of data collected over 2 years with differing average temperatures. We found that elevated temperatures in excess of the optimum reduced the scope for growth through reduced maximum consumption and increased metabolism in young rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Increased metabolism at high temperatures resulted in increased feeding activity (consumption) by individuals to compensate and maintain growth rates similar to that observed at cooler (optimum) temperatures. However, greater feeding activity rates resulted in greater vulnerability to predators that reduced survival to only half that of the cooler year. Our work therefore identifies temperature-dependent physiology and compensatory feeding behavior as proximate mechanisms for substantial climate-induced mortality in fish populations at the scale of entire populations and waterbodies.									49	0	0	0	45	0	50			0027-8424			WOS:000247114100032	17535908

In Europe, the native pentatomid predator Picromerus bidens (Linnaeus) has been considered a potential alternative to the North American pentatomid Podisus maculiventris (Say) for the control of lepidopteran, coleopteran and hymenopteran defoliator pests. In the current study, prey consumption and developmental duration of the predatory stages of P. bidens and P. maculiventris were investigated at three temperatures (18, 23 and 27 degrees C) in the laboratory using caterpillars of Spodoptera littoralis as prey. Development time from second to fifth instar was longer for P. bidens than for P. maculiventris, taking on average 17-44 and 14-32 days, respectively, at the different temperatures. Total nymphal consumption of fourth instar S. littoralis caterpillars indicated a greater voracity of P. bidens as compared with P. maculiventris at both the low and high temperatures tested (18 and 27 degrees C). At 23 degrees C, however, the predation rate of P. maculiventris nymphs exceeded that of P. bidens nymphs. Effect of temperature on the functional response of P. bidens to densities of fourth instar Spodoptera exigua was assessed on potted green bean plants. Female adults of P. bidens exhibited a type II functional response at 18 and 23 degrees C but a type III response at 27 degrees C. Searching efficiency was not affected by temperature but handling time decreased from 4.2 to 1.4 h as temperature increased from 18 to 23 degrees C. However, the predator spent twice as much time handling prey at 27 degrees C (2.9 h) than at 23 degrees C. This study indicates high predation rates of P. bidens at a wide range of temperatures and suggests that the species may be a valuable asset for the biological control of defoliating caterpillars, provided that obstacles to its mass production can be overcome.									21	1	0	0	24	1	24			0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000241874700005	17092360

BIOLOGY LETTERS				3	2			185	188		10.1098/rsbl.2006.0588				APR 22 2007	2007	Sandeels are known to be negatively affected by climate change in a number of ways. This study investigated whether these changes are affecting the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a species which consumes sandeels. Porpoise diet was examined in spring (March-May), a critical time of year for survival when sandeels are important prey, from 1993 to 2001 to provide baseline information on the proportion of sandeels consumed. When data from spring 2002 and 2003 were compared to these baseline data, the diet was found to be substantially different, with a significant and substantially smaller proportion of sandeels being consumed in March and May. There were also differences in the number of porpoises starving between the two time periods (33% in spring 2002 and 2003 died of starvation, but only 5% in the baseline period). This suggests that a lower proportion of sandeels in the diet of porpoises in spring increases the likelihood of starvation. Therefore, we suggest that the negative effects of climate change on sandeel availability may have serious negative effects on harbour porpoise populations in the North Sea by increasing the likelihood of starvation in spring.									51	1	0	0	47	0	56			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000244947700022	17251125

Under some conditions, warming should increase top-down control, and trophic transfer rates, leading to declines in prey populations. We tested this prediction in the Galapagos Islands, an equatorial upwelling region, where water temperatures are highly variable and nutrient availability is thought to control primary production and standing algal biomass. We used grazing assays, field surveys, and a herbivore exclusion experiment to test the hypothesis that grazing rate and algal biomass are, in part, regulated by temperature via the temperature-dependence of herbivory. Grazing rates were greater during the warm season for urchins and other consumers (including fishes, turtles, and iguanas). Field surveys at 10 sites over 5 years found that temperature was strongly negatively related to macroalgal cover. The results of the exclusion experiment indicate that herbivores had a large effect on macroalgal biomass, even during intense upwelling. Our results suggest that in shallow subtidal habitats across the Galapagos archipelago, grazing pressure increases with temperature, potentially resulting in reduced algal biomass when upwelling is weak and greater algal biomass when upwelling is strong and water is cold; an alternative explanation for widely observed association between upwelling intensity and algal biomass.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6				2296-7745		WOS:000457366100001

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of zooplankton biomass (as a measure of density), fish biomass, light intensity and water temperature on the attack rate and swimming characteristics (i.e. swimming speed and angle of turn) of juvenile (1+) brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) in field enclosures. We used a portable underwater camera system in a series of pelagic enclosures to quantify the feeding behaviour of brook charr over a gradient of natural conditions.2. In simple linear or non-linear regression models we found (i) that attack rate and angle of turn were positively related to water temperature, (ii) that attack rate and swimming speed were positively related to zooplankton biomass and light intensity and (iii) that attack rate was positively related to swimming speed. In multiple regression models, fish biomass, light intensity and variance of the angle of turn accounted for 87% of the variation in attack rate. Light intensity and water temperature accounted for 86% of the variation in swimming speed. Fish gut fullness and attack rate accounted for 83% of the variation in the variance of the angle of turn executed by fish.3. The increase in the number of attacks as zooplankton biomass increases conforms to the general positive functional response observed in other fish species. Our results also support the hypothesis that swimming speed increases with prey biomass. We did not observe a plateau in attack rate as zooplankton biomass increased. As our experiments were performed under natural biotic and abiotic conditions, factors other than zooplankton biomass might affect or limit this response, such as water temperature and light intensity.4. Because zooplankton biomass was correlated with water temperature and light intensity, it was not possible to evaluate the independent contribution of these factors on the attack rate and swimming characteristics (swimming speeds and angle of turn) of brook charr. However, this study highlighted the impact of these factors on the feeding behaviour of juvenile brook charr when feeding in the pelagic habitat under natural conditions, and their importance in future models of optimal foraging and fish habitat quality.									21	0	0	0	19	0	21			0046-5070			WOS:000178848300010

Medusae of A. aurita (2.24 to 32.0 g wet weight) with an initial excess food supply were kept at 1 of 4 temperatures (5.1, 10.0, 16.4 and 19.0 degrees C). Daily weight-specific growth rate (G) for each individual medusa was calculated from growth of the subumbrellar area, which was estimated from image analysis of video recorded medusae. Average value of G increased significantly with temperature, and ranged from 0.053 d(-1) at 5 degrees C to 0.15 d(-1) at 16.5 degrees C. The laboratory results were compared to in situ growth rates calculated from field observations of change in size of medusae from Gullmarsfjorden, western Sweden, 1993 to 1996. Specific growth rates in situ ranged from 0.11 to 0.16 d(-1). Growth rates calculated from simulations of growth, based on laboratory-determined temperature-specific growth rates and surface water temperature in Gullmarsfjorden, were similar to or lower than in situ specific growth rates. In situ growth of A. aurita ceased in summer. This is suggested to be due to more energy being allocated to reproduction than somatic growth, food shortage, or a genetically determined cessation of somatic growth after reproduction.									30	1	0	0	23	0	32			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000072100100014

In laboratory experiments, shrimp feeding rates on flounder eggs were positively correlated with temperature and shrimp size. Immunological assays of shrimp stomach contents indicated that 7.2% of shrimp collected from the Niantic River (Connecticut) had flounder eggs in their stomachs. Incidence of egg predation was highest in February (20%) and decreased continuously into early April (1.2%). In a deterministic model simulating predator-induced mortality of flounder eggs during a spawning season, shrimp consumed 0.4%-49.7% of the total flounder spawn. Variations in shrimp population abundance and size structure accounted for the greatest variability in egg mortality. Water temperature during the spawning season presumably alters the population dynamics of early-stage flounder. In a long-term survey, the number of yolk-sac flounder larvae in warm years (>= 4.3 degrees C) was depressed at high egg densities, indicating strong compensatory processes that increased egg mortality and limited the abundance of larvae. Failure of flounder to produce strong year-classes of larvae during warm years, possibly resulting from altered trophic dynamics, may explain the inability of stocks to recover from previous overexploitation.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000231599300012

Influence of prey size and environmental factors,on predation by Podisus maculiventris (Hemiptera : Pentatomidae) on viburnum leaf beetle (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae)								CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST				140	2			192	202						MAR-APR 2008	2008	Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions to determine the influence of the relative sizes of predator and prey, temperature, presence of refugia, size of the search area, and host-plant species on the predation performance of Podisus maculiventris (Say) nymphs against viburnum leaf beetle, Pyrrhalta viburni (Paykull), a new landscape pest in North America that feeds on the foliage of species of Viburnum L. (Caprifoliaceae). Predator handling time was positively correlated with body mass of the prey for all instars of P. maculiventris, but the rate of increase of handling time relative to prey mass decreased as predator age increased. Temperature was positively correlated with predation rates, but the presence of refugia did not have an impact on predation. The influence of host-plant species and size of the search area was tested on southern arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum L.) and American cranberrybush (Viburnum opulus L. var. americanum Aiton). There was a significant interaction between plant species and size of the search area, the species effect becoming significant as leaf surface area increased. In the case of southern arrowwood a negative correlation between size of the search area and predation rate was also detected. The identification of these factors adds valuable knowledge for using P maculiventris as a biological-control agent against P. viburni.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0008-347X	1918-3240		WOS:000255098000007

Larval anchovy were caught from May to November. The range in standard length (SL) of the larval anchovy was 10-35 mm, and larvae of SL 20-25 mm dominated numerically, accounting for more than 40% of all anchovy larvae. Daily growth rates for the last five days before catch increased from May to July, decreased or were stagnant in August and September, increased again in October, and decreased in November. Seawater temperature and density of copepod nauplii were correlated with the daily growth rate. In this study, the relationship between growth rate and temperature showed a skewed dome shape, with an optimum temperature for growth of around 23 A degrees C. These results in summer of 2008 suggest that the growth rate of Japanese anchovy increased with increasing temperature for temperatures < 23 A degrees C, but growth was limited by prey availability and/or other factors, such as low dissolved oxygen, at higher temperatures. Recent environmental improvements in nutrient inputs to Osaka Bay are discussed in relation to larval growth rate.									1	0	0	0	2	0	2			0919-9268	1444-2906		WOS:000427098900021

A higher temperature would directly affect the growth rates of lake organisms; however, the growth responses of lake herbivores to increased temperatures may be complex. Under limited nutrient supplies, for example, increased temperature may accelerate the growth of phytoplankton but consequently decrease their nutrient content, which may in turn reduce herbivore growth. Thus, temperature-driven declines in food nutrient content may offset the positive effects of warming on herbivore growth depending on the trophic condition of habitats. We examined this hypothesis by laboratory experiments that simultaneously manipulated temperature and stoichiometric interactions between green algae (Scenedesmus) and a planktonic herbivore (Daphnia) under various phosphorous conditions. The following experiments were performed with Scenedesmus and Daphnia at the same temperatures (12, 16, 20 and 248 degrees C). In the first experiment, Scenedesmus were grown in semi-batch cultures at four different phosphorus supply rates with a fixed dilution rate (i.e., algal loss rate). In the second experiment, algae were grown at four different dilution rates with a fixed phosphorus supply level. Then, the steady-state algae were harvested daily and fed directly to juvenile Daphnia to measure their specific growth rates in both experiments. Increased temperature accelerated Daphnia growth in both experiments. However, the effect of temperature decreased with decreasing phosphorus supply rate and dilution rates, although algae were sufficiently abundant. This was because the algal phosphorus: carbon ratio decreased with increasing temperature, especially when phosphorus availability for algae was small due to low phosphorus supply or dilution rates. The results clearly showed for the first time that direct stimulation of herbivore growth by warming can be offset by poor food stoichiometry. We suggest that in lakes with low algal growth rates due to low nutrient inputs or in lakes with low algal loss rates due to a shortage of algal grazers, warming may indirectly slow herbivore growth despite increased algal biomass.									9	1	0	0	10	0	10			2150-8925			WOS:000208810800007		
J	Mehner, T				Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008	Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X			Influence of spring warming on the predation rate of underyearling fish on Daphnia - a deterministic simulation approach								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				45	2			253	263		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00551.x				OCT 2000	2000	1. According to previous field studies in the biomanipulated Bautzen reservoir (Germany), a midsummer decline of the dominating zooplankter, Daphnia galeata, was suggested to be initiated by a simultaneous occurrence of low fecundity of the daphnids and a selective feeding of underyearling fish on mature daphnids. The timing of both processes was assumed to be triggered by spring water temperature. However, the field data were not appropriate for testing whether yearly differences in spring warming are strong enough to control the predation rate of underyearling fish on daphnids.2. By combining field data on fish growth, feeding and population mortality, the daily uptake of Daphnia by a virtual population of underyearling perch (Perca fluviatilis) was simulated, in addition, the daily predatory mortality of mature daphnids was calculated independently. Scenarios with a warm and a cold spring were compared. Furthermore, the delayed warming of a pelagic zone of a lake versus a littoral one was simulated. Sensitivity of the simulation to changes in five parameters was tested.3. In both the warm spring scenario and the littoral warming scenario, more daphnids in general and more mature daphnids in particular were eaten, compared with the cold spring and pelagic scenarios. The predatory mortality of mature daphnids was driven by the increasing gape size of growing fish such that in warmer years the fish reach earlier the size at which they can eat mature daphnids.4. The simulation was most sensitive to changes in daily mortality rate of the fish and to the size at maturity of the daphnids. Since at least the fish mortality is also temperature-dependent via the growth rates of fish, the predation rate of perch on D. galeata in Bautzen reservoir is substantially increased during a warm spring. This underlines the assumption that even a slight global warming may have a decisive influence on food web processes due to the fine-scaled patterns of trophic interactions in lakes.

The temperature dependance of these processes-which are the underlying mechanisms of ecological dynamics-is often thought to be exponential or unimodal, generally supported by short-term experiments. However, ecological dynamics unfold over many generations. Our goal was to empirically document shifts in predator-prey cycles over the full range of temperatures that can possibly support a predator-prey system and then to uncover the effect of temperature on the underlying mechanisms driving those changes.Methods: We measured the population dynamics of the Didinium-Paramecium predator-prey system across a wide range of temperatures to reveal systematic changes in the dynamics of the system. We then used ordinary differential equation fitting to estimate parameters of a model describing the dynamics, and used these estimates to assess the long-term temperature dependance of all the underlying mechanisms.Results: We found that predator-prey cycles shrank in state space from colder to hotter temperatures and that both cycle period and amplitude varied with temperature. Model parameters showed mostly unimodal responses to temperature, with one parameter (predator mortality) increasing monotonically with temperature and one parameter (predator conversion efficiency) invariant with temperature. Our results indicate that temperature can have profound, systematic effects on ecological dynamics, and these can arise through diverse and simultaneous changes in multiple underlying mechanisms. Predicting the effects of temperature on ecological dynamics may require additional investigation into how the underlying drivers of population dynamics respond to temperature beyond a short-term, acute response.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000541398400012	32596054

To predict the effects of climate change, it is important to know whether productivity is linked to temperature, and whether species' traits affect responses to climate change. To address these objectives, we analysed monitoring data from the Finnish constant effort site ringing scheme collected in 1987-2013 for 20 common songbird species together with climatic data. Warm spring temperature had a positive linear relationship with productivity across the community of 20 species independent of species' traits (realized thermal niche or migration behaviour), suggesting that even the warmest spring temperatures remained below the thermal optimum for reproduction, possibly due to our boreal study area being closer to the cold edge of all study species' distributions. The result also suggests a lack of mismatch between the timing of breeding and peak availability of invertebrate food of the study species. Productivity was positively related to annual growth rates in long-distance migrants, but not in short-distance migrants. Across the 27-year study period, temporal trends in productivity were mostly absent. The population sizes of species with colder thermal niches had decreasing trends, which were not related to temperature responses or temporal trends in productivity. The positive connection between spring temperature and productivity suggests that climate warming has potential to increase the productivity in bird species in the boreal zone, at least in the short term.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000426320400025	29350284

We determined how temperature, population structure, and age-specific consumption influenced walleye growth and consumption during 1986-1995. For each year, we used individual-based bioenergetics modeling to compare growth and consumption by walleye in Lake Erie's western or central basin with those of walleye moving seasonally between basins. Population structure strongly affected walleye growth and consumption but had little influence on interbasin growth rate comparisons. Based on water temperature alone, growth and consumption by western basin walleye were generally lower than for central basin or migratory populations and were more limited by summer water temperatures. In simulations combining effects of population structure, temperature, and age-specific consumption, migratory walleye grew most rapidly, taking advantage of temperature-related growth peaks in both basins. Estimates of walleye predatory demand declined with population size from 1988 through 1995. With natural feedbacks, predatory demand interacts with prey production, limiting walleye reproductive potential when prey availability is low. However, immediate impact on predatory inertia is limited, complicating our ability to predict how predatory demand and prey availability interact in Lake Erie.									31	0	0	0	31	0	33			0706-652X			WOS:000081027900001

While the detrimental effects of summer heat waves have been widely studied, little is known about the impacts of winter warming on marine species in temperate regions. Many species benefit from low winter temperature-induced reductions in metabolism, as these permit conservation of energy reserves that are needed to support reproduction in spring. Here, we used a unique outdoor mesocosm system to expose a coastal predator-prey system, the sea starAsteriasand the blue musselMytilus, to different winter warming scenarios under near-natural conditions. We found that the body condition of mussels decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. Sea star growth also decreased with increasing temperature, which was a function of unaltered predation rates and decreased mussel body condition.Asteriasrelative digestive gland mass strongly declined over the studied temperature interval (catwofold). This could have severe implications for reproductive capacity in the following spring, as digestive glands provide reserve compounds to maturing gonads. Thus, both predator and prey suffered from a mismatch of energy acquisition versus consumption in warmer winter scenarios, with pronounced consequences for food web energy transfer in future oceans.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000553111800006	32673558

They are highly variable with regards to vegetation structure and physico-chemical features that potentially mediate outcomes of biotic interactions. Multiple environmental variables and their emergent impacts on the relationship between prey consumption rate by a predator and prey density (functional response), however, are rarely assessed. Here, we investigated the combined effects of temperature and habitat complexity on the functional response of the freshwater predatory notonectid Enithares sobria on the cladoceran prey organism Daphnia longispina. A Type II functional response was observed for E. sobria predating on D. longispina and while temperature and habitat complexity had no effect on the response type, these environmental variables interacted with consequences for the magnitude of the functional responses. Overall, structural complexity favored the predator as greater consumption was observed in the most complex habitat treatment. Temperature effects were also evident although these effects were not unidirectional with regard to treatment factor gradients as predators were the most successful at intermediary temperatures. Furthermore, there was a complex interplay between habitat complexity and temperature, with attack rates being greatest at low and high complexities within intermediate temperatures, while at zero complexity attack rates were greatest at the lowest temperature. The effect of habitat on handling times was only evident in the low temperature treatments which decreased steadily with each increase in complexity. Through the application of functional responses the synergistic effects of multiple environmental drivers on predator-prey interaction outcomes have been highlighted, adding insight into how interactions among species may be affected by natural or artificially induced environmental variability.									31	0	0	0	29	0	31			2150-8925			WOS:000374896300019		
J	Holsman, Kirstin K.; Aydin, Kerim								Comparative methods for evaluating climate change impacts on the foraging ecology of Alaskan groundfish								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				521				217	235		10.3354/meps11102				FEB 17 2015	2015	Climate change is expected to strongly impact Alaskan (USA) marine ecosystems, particularly those of the northern Bering Sea. To understand how climate change may alter predator demand for prey resources, we quantified the relationship between temperature and allometric rates of prey consumption for 3 major groundfish predators: walleye pollock Gadus chalco grammus, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, and arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias. We contrasted regional patterns in foraging rates of more than 120000 fish collected annually from 1981 to 2011 from the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and Aleutian Islands (AI). From field observations, we estimate that juveniles and adults of each species eat 1.15 to 3.94 and 0.84 to 3.13 times their body weight (BW) yr(-1), respectively (i.e. 0.2 to 1.2% BW d(-1)), with arrowtooth in all 3 regions and adult EBS Pacific cod exhibiting the highest rates. If historical patterns signify future conditions, we estimate that a 2 degrees C projected increase in water temperature would cause 26 and 14% increases in daily rations of adult EBS pollock and Pacific cod, respectively, whereas we predict a 37% decline in the daily rations of EBS arrowtooth. Similarly, we predict that GOA pollock, Pacific cod and arrowtooth rations would increase markedly (70, 34, and 65%, respectively). Although daily ration of AI arrowtooth may increase by 31%, our models predict 41 and 3% declines in AI pollock and Pacific cod rations, respectively. These results portend (sometimes counterintuitively) region-and species-specific shifts in Alaska groundfish predator for aging rates and trophodynamic interactions concomitant with climate change.									16	0	0	0	10	0	16			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000349996200016

We predicted that climate warming and CO 2-enrichment should strengthen trophic cascades by reducing the relative efficiency of predation-resistant herbivores, if herbivore consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. This weakens the insurance effect of herbivore diversity. We tested this prediction using experimental ocean warming and acidification in seagrass mesocosms. Meta-analyses of published experiments first indicated that consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. The experiment then showed that three common herbivores together controlled macroalgae and facilitated seagrass dominance, regardless of climate change. When the predation-vulnerable herbivore was excluded in normal conditions, the two resistant herbivores maintained top-down control. Under warming, however, increased algal growth outstripped control by herbivores and the system became algal-dominated. Consequently, climate change can reduce the relative efficiency of resistant herbivores and weaken the insurance effect of biodiversity.									53	5	0	0	47	0	57			1461-023X			WOS:000305943000012	22676312

Production of a small number of large eggs maximizes female fitness under poor food conditions, as does a large number of small eggs under rich food conditions. Gnathopogon caerulescens (Honmoroko) spawns over a wide range of water temperature from spring to summer. Thus, we determined whether or not egg size varied with water temperature and how egg size influenced hatchling size at different water temperature. Changes in egg size strongly correlated with seasonal changes in water temperature around the lake, regardless of time and area. An experiment using eggs from the lake indicated that hatchling size has a significant positive relationship with egg size in water temperatures of 24 A degrees C. On the other hand, a lower incubation temperature, similar to that likely to be encountered at the beginning of the spawning season, resulted in a smaller hatchling size, eggs requiring a longer time to hatch. At the beginning of the spawning season, therefore, egg size may have a lesser impact on hatching size in the natural environment of Honmoroko because of the relatively lower temperatures. Although fish larvae below a certain threshold of effective body size are generally not expected to have a high early survival rate due to, for example, a lower competitive ability or a high susceptibility to predation, seasonal egg size variation in Honmoroko may be adaptive so as to enhance the likehood of early survival by establishing an effective body size under changing water temperature conditions.									10	0	0	0	11	0	11			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000350567300017

Mean daily food intake (MDI; g d(-1)) and relative daily food intake (RDI; g g(-1) d(-1)) increased with temperature from 2.4 to 10.8 degrees C and decreased at 23.4 degrees C. Temperatures of maximum daily food intake values were 13.6 degrees C for MDI and 14.4 degrees C for RDI. No correlation between food intake values and burbot weight was observed. RDI values were used to estimate annual food consumption of burbot population.

In this study, we investigated how rising temperatures alter larval interactions between a naturally range-expanding dragonfly, Crocothemis erythraea, and a native northern European species, Leucorrhinia dubia. Initial studies revealed that C.erythraea grow up to 3.5 times faster than L.dubia at temperatures above 16 degrees C. As a result, we hypothesised that divergent temperature responses would lead to rapid size differences between coexisting larvae and, consequently, to asymmetric intraguild predation at higher ambient temperatures. 2.Mortality and growth rates were measured in interaction treatments (with both species present) and non-interaction controls (one species present) at four different temperature regimes: at an ambient temperature representative of central Germany, where both species overlap in distribution, and at temperatures increased by 2, 4 and 6 degrees C. 3.The mortality of C.erythraea did not differ between treatment and control. In contrast, mortality of L.dubia remained similar over all temperatures in the controls, but increased with temperature in the presence of the other species and was significantly higher there than in the controls. We concluded that L.dubia suffered asymmetric intraguild predation, particularly at increased temperature. Reduced growth rate of L.dubia in the interaction treatment at higher temperatures also suggested asymmetric competition for prey in the first phase of the experiment. 4.The results imply that the range expansion of C.erythraea may cause reduction in population size of syntopic L.dubia when temperature rises by more than 2 degrees C. The consequences for future range patterns, as well as other factors that may influence the interaction in nature, are discussed.									16	0	0	0	17	0	19			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000316286700007

Many of these systems are dominated by lake trout, which act as keystone predators. For arctic Alaska Toolik Lake, we have a 16-yr record of physical, chemical, and biological data. Our temperature data show a 3 degrees C increase in mean July epilimnetic temperatures. An individual-based bioenergetics model for young-of-year (YOY) lake trout in the lake was used to examine the effects of climate warming on growth of YOY lake trout. Our simulation models predicted that with a July temperature increase, YOY lake trout would need to consume >8-fold more food (>10-fold with seasonally increased temperatures) to achieve the same end-of-year size as historically surviving YOY lake trout. We have observed no increase in food availability in the lake, and recent analysis shows that primary productivity has actually decreased. If recent changes in the lake foreshadow a long-term trend, our model results suggest that YOY lake trout will not survive their first winter. Such changes, coupled with other current anthropogenic impacts in the arctic, may disrupt lake trout control of the trophic structure in arctic lakes.

Postprandial ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption rates were determined after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours. The 48-h post-feeding weight-specific ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption rates increased until 4 h post-feeding, decreased to 18 h post-feeding, and remained relatively stable until 48 h post-feeding. The highest weight-specific ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption rates were 215 +/- 19.8 mu g NH3-N g(-1) h(-1) and 1,778 +/- 55.6 mu g O-2 g(-1) h(-1) 2-4 h post-feeding at 13 degrees C. The higher (P<0.05) resting ammonia and oxygen consumption at 16 degrees C 12-h post-feeding indicate that this temperature is not appropriate for inducing higher growth of rotifer-fed pacific cod larvae.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			1303-2712	2149-181X		WOS:000309697800009

The Effects of Reproductive Status and Water Temperature on the Caloric Intake of Tursiops truncatus								AQUATIC MAMMALS				46	4			382	394		10.1578/AM.46.4.2020.382				2020	2020	Several studies have examined diurnal consumption patterns and energy requirements of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), yet little is known about how these values change with respect to reproductive status and small-scale changes in water temperature. This study describes a comparative assessment of the caloric intake of three populations of resident Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, all housed in ambient seawater facilities, with respect to sex, reproductive state, and water temperature. Weekly caloric intake, based on catch-specific caloric values of each dietary component, was calculated for five adult males and eight adult females with repeated measurements on animals in the following reproductive states over the course of 12 to 24 months: males (n = 5), pregnant/lactating (n = 2), pregnant/non-lactating (n = 7), non-pregnant/lactating (n = 6), and non-pregnant/non-lactating (n = 7). Although food was provisioned, rate and magnitude of provisioning was driven by appetitive responses exhibited by each individual dolphin. Males exhibited a significantly higher caloric load than non-preg,nantlnon-lactating, females. Among females, lactating females (pregnant arid non-pregnant) exhibited significantly higher consumption values when compared to females in all other reproductive states, highlighting the energetic cost of lactation. Additionally, there was an inverse relationship between mean monthly caloric intake and mean monthly water temperature, capturing the influence of temperature on the energetic demands of small odontocetes. These data can be utilized to estimate the carrying capacity of wild habitats, to improve management, arid to serve as a baseline for the strategic development of provisioning protocols in managed care.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-5427			WOS:000548356400005

Elatobium abietinum is an important pest of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), causing defoliation of trees, and is predicted to become more abundant in response to climatic change, reducing spruce productivity. Populations are also moderated by invertebrate predators, though the extent to which this might be modified under a changing climate is unclear. Elatobium abietinum is preyed upon by the coccinellid species Aphidecta obliterata (a spruce specialist) and Adalia bipunctata (a generalist), populations of which naturally occur in spruce plantations. This study sought to investigate the effect of different intensities and frequencies of drought on the consumption rate of the aphids by the two coccinellids. In Petri dish trials, severe drought stress increased the consumption rates of 3rd instar aphids by both adult and larval coccinellids. Moderate intermittent stress tended to result in a reduced consumption rate for larval coccinellids only, suggesting an age-dependent response. The findings of this study suggest that, under drought conditions, a prey-mediated effect on predator consumption, and, therefore, biocontrol efficacy, is likely, with drought intensity and frequency playing an important role in determining the nature of the response.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2075-4450		WOS:000392274800003

In cases of size-specific predation, environmental influences on the growth rate of one or both species can determine predation rates. For example, warming increases top-down control of food webs, although this depends on resource availability for prey, as increased resources may allow prey to reach a size refuge. Moreover, because the magnitude of inducible defenses depends on predation rates and resource availability for prey, temperature and resource levels also affect phenotypic plasticity. To examine these issues, we manipulated the presence/absence of predatory Hynobius retardatus salamander larvae and herbivorous Rana pirica tadpoles at two temperatures and three basal resource levels. and measured their morphology, behavior, growth and survival. Prior work has shown that both species express antagonistic plasticity against one another in which salamanders enlarge their gape width and tadpoles increase their body width to reach a size-refuge. We found that increased temperatures increased predation rates, although this was counteracted by high basal resource availability, which further decreased salamander growth. Surprisingly, salamanders caused tadpoles to grow larger and express more extreme defensive phenotypes as resource levels decreased under warming, most likely due to their increased risk of predation. Thus, temperature and resources influenced defensive phenotype expression and its impacts on predator and prey growth by affecting their interaction strength. Our results indicate that basal resource levels can modify the impacts of increased temperatures on predator-prey interactions and its consequences for food webs.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000358089400021	25820751

While increased temperatures are a key aspect of urbanization ("urban heat islands"), we have very limited knowledge whether this generates differentiation in thermal responses between rural and urban populations. In a common garden experiment, we compared the thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rate and mortality in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella from three urban and three rural populations. TPCs for growth rate shifted vertically, consistent with the faster-slower theoretical model whereby the cold-adapted rural larvae grew faster than the warm-adapted urban larvae across temperatures. In line with costs of rapid growth, rural larvae showed lower survival than urban larvae across temperatures. The relatively lower temperatures hence expected shorter growing seasons in rural populations compared to the populations in the urban heat islands likely impose stronger time constraints to reach a certain developmental stage before winter, thereby selecting for faster growth rates. In addition, higher predation rates at higher temperature may have contributed to the growth rate differences between urban and rural ponds. A faster- slower differentiation in TPCs may be a widespread pattern along the urbanization gradient. The observed microgeographic differentiation in TPCs supports the view that urbanization may drive life-history evolution. Moreover, because of the urban heat island effect, urban environments have the potential to aid in developing predictions on the impact of climate change on rural populations.									22	0	0	0	19	0	22			1752-4571			WOS:000414952000010	29151861

However, previous research in amphibians and other ectothermic vertebrates suggests that some morphological traits are generally insensitive to environmental inductions. We conducted a literature survey to examine the allometric responses in relative hind leg length and head shape of post-metamorphic anuran amphibians to induced environmental (temperature, resource level, predation and desiccation risk) variation operating during the larval phase in 44 studies using 19 species. To estimate and compare plastic responses across studies, we employed both an index of plasticity and effect sizes from a meta-analysis. We found contrasting trait responses to different environmental cues. Higher temperatures increased development more than growth rate and induced smaller heads but not overall shifts in hind leg length. In contrast, an increment in resource availability increased growth more than development, with a parallel increase in hind leg length but no change in head shape. Increases in predation risk decreased both development and growth rates and slightly reduced relative hind leg length, but there was no change in head shape. Pond desiccation induced quick development and low growth rates, with no changes in morphology. Across environments, both hind leg and head shape plasticity were positively correlated with growth rate plasticity. However, plasticity of developmental rate was only correlated with head shape plasticity. Overall, these results suggest that environmental trends predicted by global warming projections, such as increasing pond temperature and accelerating pond desiccation, will significantly influence hind leg and head morphology in metamorphic frogs, which may affect performance and, ultimately, fitness.									66	1	1	0	66	0	69			0936-577X	1616-1572		WOS:000280830000004

The response of communities, driven by the direct effects of ocean change on individual species as well the cascade of indirect effects, has received far less study. We used several rocky intertidal species including crabs, whelks, juvenile abalone, and mussels to determine how feeding, growth, and interactions between species could be shifted by changing ocean conditions. Our 10 wk experiment revealed many complex outcomes which highlight the unpredictability of community-level responses. Contrary to our predictions, the largest impact of elevated CO2 was reduced crab feeding and survival, with a pH drop of 0.3 units. Surprisingly, whelks showed no response to higher temperatures or CO2 levels, while abalone shells grew 40 % less under high CO2 conditions. Massive non-consumptive effects of crabs on whelks showed how important indirect effects can be in deter mining climate change responses. Predictions of species outcomes that account solely for physiological responses to climate change do not consider the potentially large role of indirect effects due to species interactions. For strongly linked species (e.g. predator-prey or competitor relationships), the indirect effects of climate change are much less known than direct effects, but may be far more powerful in reshaping future marine communities.									16	0	0	0	12	0	16			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000401800100001

HYDROBIOLOGIA				798	1			119	126		10.1007/s10750-015-2436-5				SEP 2017	2017	Filamentous cyanobacteria disturb food collection in Daphnia by mechanical interference with the filtering apparatus by the long trichomes. The intensity of this interference depends on the water temperature and the Daphnia body size. However, Daphnia are capable of breaking down the filaments, therefore improving the palatability of the cyanobacteria. The main objective of this study was to test whether the shortening of cyanobacterial filaments and the ensuing clearance rate of Daphnia would increase at higher temperatures to a greater degree in small-bodied Daphnia species than in large-bodied one. Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted in order to measure variation in the length of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii trichomes and to calculate clearance rate. The filament length and the cyanobacteria clearance rate by Daphnia were calculated following their exposure to grazing by large-bodied D. pulicaria and small-bodied D. longispina in 20, 24, and 28A degrees C. Rising temperature did not affect the intensity of breakage of C. raciborskii trichomes by D. pulicaria and caused decrease in clearance rate of this species, whereas for D. longispina, the temperature increase enhanced both filament breakage and clearance rate. We suggest that these temperature-related changes may affect relative competitive performance of Daphnia species in the presence of cyanobacteria.					10th International Symposium on Cladocera10th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2014SEP 28-OCT 03, 2014	Charles Univ, Dept EcolCharles Univ, Dept Ecol	Lednice, CZECH REPUBLICLednice, CZECH REPUBLIC	7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000404686800012

Consumer functional responses provide a useful tool to examine relationships between consumption rates and ecologically relevant prey densities, whilst also accounting for abiotic factors that likely influence consumption rates. We investigated how temperature influences the consumer functional response of the amphipodGammarus lacustristowards the cercariae of three freshwater trematodes (Diplostomum,ApatemonandTrichobilharzia). Amphipods displayed different functional responses towards the parasites, with Type II responses forDiplostomumand Type I responses forApatemonprey. Temperature did not alter the consumption rate of the amphipod predator.Trichobilharziawas likely consumed at similar proportions asDiplostomum; however, this could not be fully evaluated due to low replication. Whilst Type II responses of invertebrate predators are common to various invertebrate prey types, this is the first time a non-filter feeding predator has been shown to exhibit Type I response towards cercarial prey. The prey-specific consumption patterns of amphipods were related to cercarial distribution in the water column rather than to the size of cercariae or temperature influence. The substantial energy flow into food webs by non-host consumer organisms highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that modulate functional responses and direct predation in the context of parasitic organisms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0932-0113	1432-1955		WOS:000566692600001	32845358

Here, we used long-term data from natural predator-prey interactions between white sharks Carcharodon carcharias and Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus in False Bay, South Africa, paired with environmental monitoring to examine potential relationships between temperature variability and shark predation rates on seals. Based on generalized linear modelling of a dataset of 941 shark attacks on seals collected over 15 years (1999-2013) during the austral winter (May-September) season, we found water temperature was included as a significant predictor of daily and monthly variability in predation rates. However, the signal of temporal variability over the season emerged as a more predominant predictor. Moreover, inter-annual variability in predation rate appeared linked to other environmental factors (wind, water visibility, and the occurrence of El Nino and La Nina events) rather than water temperature. These data suggest that water temperatures on an intra-annual scale might contribute to predation patterns in white sharks either directly or indirectly (e.g. due to associated changes in prey availability), but do not implicate water temperature as a primary driver in this scenario, or at an interannual scale. It is possible that (1) the metabolic demand of white sharks may be modulated against temperature variability by their partially endothermic nature, and (2) the predation patterns of white sharks on seals are the result of a complex interplay between ambient physical conditions and broader oceanographic, biological, and ecological factors.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000426256700011

Correlations have suggested that growth of Daphnia, a major consumer of phytoplankton in freshwaters, is limited by a low content of the polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in natural phytoplankton and thus by food quality. Here we used the EPA-free green alga Chlamydomonas klinobasis and Daphnia magna to test for such food quality effects. The alga was grown in continuous cultures at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C and, different from other studies, dilution rates accounted for the effects of temperature on algal growth. This resulted in a maximum content of total fatty acids, of total PUFAs, of n-3 PUFAs and of alpha-linolenic acid when grown at 20 degrees C, whereas at 15 degrees C the lowest content of n-6 PUFAs and a threefold higher n-3/n-6 ratio than at 20 and 25 degrees C were observed. Unexpectedly the PUFA content did not show a maximum at 15 degrees C. Growth experiments with D. magna were performed at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. With C. klinobasis grown at 20 degrees C, Daphnia somatic growth rates increased with temperature. When the alga was raised at the same temperature as Daphnia, somatic growth rates of Daphnia increased with temperature, and supplementation indicated EPA-limitation at 15 degrees C only. At 15 and at 25 degrees C, Daphnia growth was significantly higher on C. klinobasis raised at the respective temperature than on the same alga grown at 20 degrees C. Hence, estimation of temperature effects on Daphnia growth requires to grow the food at the same temperature. At 15 degrees C Daphnia newly built biomass had the highest content in total PUFAs and in a-linolenic acid, whereas the EPA-content was highest at 20 degrees C. The content of n-6 PUFAs increased with temperature, which lead to the highest ratio of n-3/n-6 PUFAs at 15 degrees C. This reflects increased PUFA-assimilation but decreased EPA-synthesis in Daphnia at lower temperatures. The results indicate that only if both algal food and consumer are grown at the same temperature, food quality effects of global warming can be more precisely predicted.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			2296-701X			WOS:000451661400001

Decadal-scale variation in diet forecasts persistently poor breeding under ocean warming in a tropical seabird								PLOS ONE				12	8					e0182545	10.1371/journal.pone.0182545				AUG 23 2017	2017	Climate change effects on population dynamics of natural populations are well documented at higher latitudes, where relatively rapid warming illuminates cause-effect relationships, but not in the tropics and especially the marine tropics, where warming has been slow. Here we forecast the indirect effect of ocean warming on a top predator, Nazca boobies in the equatorial Galapagos Islands, where rising water temperature is expected to exceed the upper thermal tolerance of a key prey item in the future, severely reducing its availability within the boobies' foraging envelope. From 1983 to 1997 boobies ate mostly sardines, a densely aggregated, highly nutritious food. From 1997 until the present, flying fish, a lower quality food, replaced sardines. Breeding success under the poor diet fell dramatically, causing the population growth rate to fall below 1, indicating a shrinking population. Population growth may not recover: rapid future warming is predicted around Galapagos, usually exceeding the upper lethal temperature and maximum spawning temperature of sardines within 100 years, displacing them permanently from the boobies' island-constrained foraging range. This provides rare evidence of the effect of ocean warming on a tropical marine vertebrate.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000408355800028	28832597

During these outbreaks, predator densities increase rapidly, and can cause large reductions in prey populations or shifts in prey size structure. However, unexpected interactions may occur at high predator densities, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of how increased predator density affects predator -prey dynamics. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, outbreaks of southern oyster drill, Stramonita haemastoma (Linnaeus, 1767), occur during high salinity events, and can greatly reduce eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791), populations. A large outbreak of drills occurred from 2013 to 2015 in Apalachicola Bay, FL which corresponded with an oyster fishery collapse in that bay. To improve our mechanistic understanding of predation during such a high -density outbreak, laboratory experiments based on field observations were used to quantify the prey size selection by drills and the drill functional response, as a function of drill abundance. Drills fed on medium-sized oysters (50-75 mm) more often than small and larg, tr-sized oysters, and often formed aggregations during feeding events. However, despite this aggregative response, there was a negative relationship between per capita feeding rates and drill abundance. Indeed, the Crowley -Martin functional response model had the most parsimonious fit to the data, suggesting that predator -predator inhibition reduced attack rates and increased handling times. Due to an increase in regional drought conditions and water usage in the southeastern United States, drill outbreaks will likely increase in frequency and duration. A greater understanding of how predation rates change with predator densities during outbreaks will improve predictions of oyster mortality, and strengthen the scientific framework for oyster fishery decisions.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000427664700008

Prey sizes used were those demonstrated previously to be preferentially consumed by the respective predators. Consumption rate of small (5-9 mm shell height, SH) scallops by sea stars was not significantly different at 40 and 8 degrees C, but was significantly higher at 15 (d)egrees C (Q(10) = 6.9). Similarly, consumption rate of large (19-23 mm SH) scallops by crabs was not significantly different at 3 degrees and 8 degrees C, but was significantly higher at 15 degrees C (Q(10) = 2.1) Increased predator activity, as indicated by increased time spent searching for prey, increased predator searching movement velocities (which, for sea stars, resulted in increased encounter rates with scallops), and shorter prey handling times, explained part of the increased predation rate by sea stars and most of that by crabs. Predation fate by sea stars also increased with temperature because of decreased effectiveness of the scallops' escape response, as evidenced by a significantly higher probability of capture upon encounter at 15 degrees C than at 4 degrees and 8 degrees C, although the probability of sea stars capturing scallops was very low (< 0.1) at all experimental temperatures. The probability of crabs capturing encountered scallops was higher (> 0.3) and independent of temperature. The probability of sea stars and crabs consuming captured scallops was similar to 1 and temperature independent.									54	5	0	0	54	0	60			0022-0981			WOS:A1994PM46900003

Diet of larval Red Salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) examined using a nonlethal technique								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				41	4			741	745		10.1670/07-019.1				DEC 2007	2007	Stream salamanders may play important roles as predators within streams, but we know little about actual predation by stream salamanders on other organisms. Because larval stream salamanders are more abundant within streams than adults, feed and forage throughout the year, and may spend multiple years in streams before transformation, larvae may play a more important role than adults in trophic interactions within streams. We conducted a study using larval Red Salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) to determine (1) the prey composition of larval salamanders, (2) whether feeding rates are affected by stream water temperature, (3) whether larval size affects the diversity of prey items, and (4) whether nonlethal stomach flushing is an effective technique for examining the diet of larval salamanders. We found that larvae consumed a wide diversity of prey items including individuals of the families Chironomidae (36.52% of prey items) and Sphaeriidae (15.17%) as well as terrestrial prey (7.87%) and other salamanders (2.25%). We also found that feeding rates were negatively correlated with stream water temperature, and larger larvae consumed a wider diversity of prey items than smaller individuals. Our results also suggest that nonlethal stomach flushing did not affect survivorship. These findings suggest that larval Red Salamanders are generalist predators that can play important trophic roles in stream ecosystems.									18	0	0	0	18	0	19			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000251700700022

For three tributaries with contrasting thermal regimes, a bioenergetics model was used to evaluate how feeding rate and energy density of prey influenced seasonal growth and stage-specific survival of juvenile O. mykiss. Sensitivity analysis examined target levels for feeding rate and energy density of prey during the growing season that improved survival to the smolt and adult stages in each tributary. Simulated daily growth was greatest during warmer months (1 July to 30 September), whereas substantial body mass was lost during cooler months (1 December to 31 March). Incremental increases in annual feeding rate or energy density of prey during summer broadened the temperature range at which faster growth occurred and increased the growth of the average juvenile to match those that survived to smolt and adult stages. Survival to later life stages could be improved by increasing feeding rate or energy density of the diet during summer months, when warmer water temperatures accommodated increased growth potential. Higher growth during the summer period in each tributary could improve resiliency during subsequent colder periods that lead to metabolic stress and weight loss. As growth and corresponding survival rates in fresh water are altered by shifting abiotic regimes, it will be increasingly important for fisheries managers to better understand the mechanisms affecting growth limitations in rearing habitats and what measures might maintain or improve growth conditions and survival.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000384310000015	27397641

The effects of temperature, food concentration, population density, and photoperiod on Daphnia carinata fitness were examined using life-table experiments in a full factorial design. The high temperature enhanced fitness at the high food concentration, but depressed it at the low food concentration. The temperature-food interactions were significant in the four combinations of two population densities and two photoperiods. The temperature-population density interactions were significant in the two combinations of two photoperiods and the high food concentration, in which the high population density masked the temperature effects. The temperature-photoperiod interaction was only significant in one combination with the low population density and the low food concentration, in which the long day length weakened the temperature effects. Such complicated interactions suggest that multiple ecological variables need to be taken into account simultaneously when assessing temperature effects on zooplankton in nature.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0270-5060	2156-6941		WOS:000329776400003		
J	Iles, Alison C.								Toward predicting community-level effects of climate: relative temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates								ECOLOGY				95	9			2657	2668		10.1890/13-1342.1				SEP 2014	2014	Predicting the effects of climate change on ecological communities requires an understanding of how environmental factors influence both physiological processes and species interactions. Specifically, the net impact of temperature on community structure depends on the relative response of physiological energetic costs (metabolism) and energetic gains (ingestion of resources) that mediate the flow of energy throughout a food web. However, the relative temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates have rarely been measured for multiple species within an ecological assemblage and it is not known how, and to what extent, these relative scaling differences vary among species. To investigate the relative influence of these processes, I measured the temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates for a suite of rocky intertidal species using a multiple regression experimental design. I compared oxygen consumption rates (as a proxy for metabolic rate) and ingestion rates by estimating the temperature scaling parameter of the universal temperature dependence (UTD) model, a theoretical model derived from first principles of biochemical kinetics and allometry. The results show that consumer metabolic rates (energetic costs) tend to be more sensitive to temperature than ingestion rates (energetic gains). Thus, as temperature increases, metabolic rates tend to increase faster relative to ingestion rates, causing the overall energetic efficiencies of these rocky intertidal invertebrates to decline. Metabolic and ingestion rates largely scaled in accordance with the UTD model; however, nonlinearity was evident in several cases, particularly at higher temperatures, in which alternative models were more appropriate. There are few studies where multiple rate dependencies are measured on multiple species from the same ecological community. These results indicate that there may be general patterns across species in the temperature scaling of biological rates, with important implications for forecasting temperature effects on ecological communities.									30	0	0	0	30	0	30			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000342340200027		
J	Visconti, Anna; Manca, Marina; De Bernardi, Riccardo								Eutrophication-like response to climate warming: an analysis of Lago Maggiore (N. Italy) zooplankton in contrasting years								JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY				67	2			87	92		10.4081/jlimnol.2008.87				2008	2008	Global mean surface temperatures are increasing. All ecosystems are likely to be affected and there is much interest at present in predicting the effects. In freshwater environments, we expect to observe, among other things, effects similar to those observed under eutrophication, such as increases in zooplankton population density and biomass as a result of enhanced population growth rates. Lago Maggiore underwent rapid eutrophication during the 60s and 70s, with a return to oligotrophy during the 80s and the 90s. Thus, it provides a case study to lest the hypothesized eutrophication-like effects of recent climate warming. More specifically, we compare zooplankton biomass and density during the exceptionally warm years of the recent oligotrophic phase with values during the non-warm years of oligotrophy, and during years of the mesotrophic phase. This permits an analysis of zooplankton biomass and density with respect to temperature increase compared with the effects of eutrophication. Zooplankton population density and biomass sharply increased in 2003, the warmest Year of the last century, as a result of Cladocera, particularly Daphnia, attaining values typical of the mesotrophic phase. These values were exceptional compared to typical values and were strongly different from those attained during cooler years since re-oligotrophication. Meat annual values of zooplankton density and biomass recorded in 2003 were fully comparable to typical values during the mesotrophic period. This observation confirms the hypothesis of an overall eutrophication-like effect of climate warming. Seasonal trends, characterized by an earlier start of population growth, arc consistent with the effects of an increase in water temperature, as observed in laboratory experiments on the reproductive and growth strategies of Daphnia.									35	0	2	0	33	0	37			1129-5767	1723-8633		WOS:000261475800002

However, it is unclear how the effects will quantitatively differ between the plant-herbivore and herbivore-carnivore interface. To test how warming could differentially affect rates of herbivory and carnivory, we studied trophic interaction strength in a food chain comprised of green algae, herbivorous rotifers and carnivorous rotifers at 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. We found significant warming-induced changes in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous rotifers, but these responses occurred at different parts of the entire temperature gradient. The strongest response of the per capita herbivore's ingestion rate occurred due to an increase in temperature from 15 to 20 degrees C (1.9 fold: from 834 to 1611 algal cells per h(-1)) and of the per capita carnivore's ingestion rate from 20 to 25 degrees C (1.6 fold: from 1.5 to 2.5 prey h(-1)). Handling time, an important component of a consumer's functional response, significantly decreased from 15 to 20 degrees C in herbivorous rotifers. In contrast, it decreased from 20 to 25 degrees C in carnivorous rotifers. Attack rates significantly and strongly increased from 10 to 25 degrees C in the herbivorous animals, but not at all in the carnivores. Our results exemplify how the relative forces of top-down control exerted by herbivores and carnivores may strongly shift under global warming. But warming, and its magnitude, are not the only issue: If our results would prove to be representative, shifts in ectotherm interactions will quantitatively differ when a 5 degrees C increase starts out from a low, intermediate or high initial temperature. This would imply that warming could have different effects on the relative forces of carnivory and herbivory in habitats differing in average temperature, as would exist at different altitudes and latitudes.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1932-6203			WOS:000336656000011	24797506

However, beyond tolerance and reproductive thresholds, little is known about temperature dependence of invaders' performance, particularly in the light of competitive attributes of functionally similar native species. We used experimentally derived energy budgets and field temperature data to determine whether anticipated warming will asymmetrically affect the energy budgets of the globally invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid crustacean Hemimysis anomala and a functionally similar native competitor (Mysis salemaai) whose range is currently being invaded. In contrast to M.salemaai, which maintains a constant feeding rate with temperature leading to diminishing energy assimilation, we found that H.anomala increases its feeding rate with temperature in parallel with growing metabolic demand. This enabled the invader to maintain high energy assimilation rates, conferring substantially higher scope for growth compared to the native analogue at spring-to-autumn temperatures. Anticipated warming will likely exacerbate this energetic asymmetry and remove the winter overlap, which, given the seasonal limitation of mutually preferred prey, appears to underpin coexistence of the two species. These results indicate that temperature-dependent asymmetries in scope for growth between invaders and native analogues comprise an important mechanism determining invasion success under warming climates. They also highlight the importance of considering relevant spectra of ecological contexts in predicting successful invaders and their impacts under warming scenarios.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000370959300011	26618450

We studied the incremental effects of chronic exposure (>60 d; effects measured bimonthly) to three temperature regimes typical of the range of conditions experienced by Sacramento River fall-run Chinook salmon during juvenile rearing and smoltification (13-16degreesC, 17-20degreesC, and 21-24degreesC; diel fluctuations of 0.5-3degreesC were allowed within these limits). Our laboratory experiments demonstrated that Chinook salmon can readily survive and grow at temperatures up to 24degreesC. However, juveniles reared at 21-24degreesC experienced significantly decreased growth rates, impaired smoltification indices, and increased predation vulnerability compared with juveniles reared at 13-16degreesC. Fish reared at 17-20degreesC experienced similar growth, variable smoltification impairment, and higher predation vulnerability compared with fish reared at 13-16degreesC. These results improve our understanding of the range of juvenile Chinook salmon responses to elevated temperatures and should assist biologists and resource decision makers in coordinating water management and salmon conservation decisions.									68	0	0	0	64	1	73			0275-5947			WOS:000220169400021

MARINE BIOLOGY				166	6					73	10.1007/s00227-019-3521-5				JUN 2019	2019	The effect of temperature on predator-prey dynamics has the potential to be an important factor regulating ecological interactions and is becoming increasingly common due to climate-change-driven range shifts and species introductions. Here, we use mesocosm experiments to evaluate the thermal sensitivity of burst swimming (a proxy for prey escape ability) and mortality rates of cohorts of introduced tropical and resident temperate marine fishes in the presence of a local temperate predator. Increasing temperature (17-21-25 degrees C) resulted in a reduction in predation rates (by Hypoplectrodes maccullochi, family Serranidae) on the tropical prey species (Abudefduf vaigiensis, family Pomacentridae) which were more warm adapted, whereas predation rates on the temperate prey species (Atypichthys strigatus, family Kyphosidae) remained unchanged over the 17-21 degrees C range (25 degrees C not tested). These changes were linearly related to predator-prey burst swimming ratios, which decreased with increasing temperature for the tropical prey but remained largely unchanged for the temperate prey. By demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of predator-prey interactions, our work highlights the importance of linking physiology with ecology to understand the consequences of climate-driven range shifts and species introductions.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000467561000006

The experiment was run for 60 days using 15 cement tanks with water temperatures of 18, 22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C in a completely randomized design with three replications. The pearl cichlids (n = 4 per tank) were distributed in tanks with heaters, which increased the water temperature by 1 degrees C h(-1), in a room held at 17 degrees C. The snails were selected (up to 3 mm) and distributed among the tanks (n = 32 per tank). The period of exposure to predation was 18 h, and the index of predation was significantly lower at 18 degrees C. Temperatures between 26 and 34 did not result in significant differences in predation. It was conclude that the pearl cichlids prey efficiently on snails at temperatures of 26 degrees C and above.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0718-560X	0717-7178		WOS:000347406200010		
J	Sanford, E								The feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators (Pisaster ochraceus and Nucella canaliculata) under water temperatures simulating episodic upwelling								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				273	2			199	218	PII S0022-0981(02)00164-8	10.1016/S0022-0981(02)00164-8				JUL 17 2002	2002	Although most upwelling regions are marked by strong fluctuations in water temperature, few studies have examined how episodic cold-water events affect the physiology and ecology of benthic marine invertebrates. I tested the hypothesis that upwelling-related variation in water temperature regulates the feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) and the whelk Nucella canaliculata (Duclos, 1832). Sea stars and whelks were maintained in laboratory tanks at a constant 9 degreesC, a constant 12 degreesC, and a treatment that simulated the Oregon coast upwelling regime by cycling between 14-day periods of 12 and 9 degreesC. Early in the experiments, sea stars and whelks held at 9 degreesC consumed about 30% fewer mussels (Mytilus trossulus) than those in warmer tanks. Despite lower consumption by whelks in colder tanks, 9 and 12 degreesC individuals attained the same final size. Similarly, sea stars in 9 degreesC tanks showed greater growth per gram of mussel tissue consumed than individuals held at 12 degreesC. These results suggest that reduced consumption under colder conditions was balanced by reduced metabolic costs. Moreover, there appeared to be an energetic advantage to living in the temperature regime characteristic of intermittent upwelling. Sea stars alternately exposed to 12 and 9 degreesC had a significantly higher growth rate, conversion efficiency, and storage of reserves in the pyloric caeca than individuals in the constant 12 degreesC tanks. Whelks maintained under fluctuating temperatures tended to grow faster than those held at constant 12 or 9 degreesC, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.069). These results suggest that benthic consumers experiencing cyclic temperatures may feed intensely during periods of warmer water while benefiting from reduced metabolic costs during cold-water intrusions. Because the fecundity of Pisaster and Nucella is a function of energy stored during the upwelling season, interannual variability in upwelling patterns could alter the reproductive output of these species.

Juvenile COTS and Acropora spp. were exposed to three temperatures (26, 28, 30 degrees C) and three pH levels (NIST scale: 8.0, 7.8, 7.6) in a flow-through cross-factorial experiment. Increased temperature and acidification had independent positive effects on growth and feeding of juvenile COTS. They grew faster and were larger under these conditions, but weighed less at low pH. Accelerated growth of juvenile COTS under ocean acidification conditions was decoupled from skeletogenesis with increased size largely due to development of soft tissue. Juveniles reared at 30 degrees C also had the greatest number of spines. To assess the recovery of Acropora spp. following sublethal COTS predation in warm and acidified conditions, corals that had been preyed on by the juveniles for 1 week were removed and held in experimental conditions to monitor their growth and survival. The stress from warming and predation had an interactive effect in reduction in coral growth. Mortality of corals was highest following predation and in the 30 degrees C treatments. There was no direct effect of acidification on growth or survival of Acropora spp. following predation. It appears that COTS juveniles may benefit from near-future warming and acidification. Thus, changing climate may increase the threat of this predatory starfish to coral reefs.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000441845500014

We examined effects of water temperature on the community structure of a three trophic level food chain (predatory fish, herbivorous caddisfly larvae and periphyton) in boreal streams. We used laboratory experiments to examine (i) the effects of water temperature on feeding activities of fish and caddisfly larvae and on periphyton productivity, to evaluate the thermal effects on each trophic level (species-level experiment), and (ii) the effects of water temperature on predation pressure of fish on abundance of the lower trophic levels, to evaluate how temperature affects top-down control by fish (community-level experiment).2. In the species-level experiment, feeding activity of fish was high at 12 degrees C, which coincides with the mean summer temperature in forested streams of Hokkaido, Japan, but was depressed at 3 degrees C, which coincides with the mean winter temperature, and also above 18 degrees C, which coincides with the near maximum summer temperatures. Periphyton productivity increased over the range of water temperatures.3. In the community-level experiments, a top-down effect of fish on the abundance of caddisfly larvae and periphyton was clear at 12 degrees C. This effect was not observed at 3 and 21 degrees C because of low predation pressure of fish at these temperatures.4. These experiments revealed that trophic cascading effects may vary with temperature even in the presence of abundant predators. Physiological depression of predators because of thermal stress can alter top-down control and lead to changes in community structure.5. We suggest that thermal habitat alteration can change food web structure via combinations of direct and indirect trophic interactions.									74	0	0	0	67	2	76			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000230576500003

No significant difference was observed in the specific growth rate in body weight of both smallmouth bass and largemouth bass between the ponds with water flowing and those without water flowing when prey fish were given. The ratio of growth rate of smallmouth bass to largemouth bass was significantly larger in the experimental periods when the water temperature in the ponds was relatively low (21.5-24.0degreesC). When no prey fish was given, largemouth bass showed a significantly larger reduction in the growth rate in ponds with water flowing, although no significant difference was observed in the growth rate of smallmouth bass between the ponds with water flowing and those without water flowing. The results show that smallmouth bass has a relatively higher adaptability to water flow and low water temperature than largemouth bass.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0021-5392	1349-998X		WOS:000225145900014

These streams spanned a range of environmental conditions, which allowed us to use bioeneractics modeling to determine the relative effects of forest cover, stream temperature, season, and fish age on food consumption and growth efficiency. Evidence of seasonal shifts in reliance on aquatic versus terrestrial food sources was detected among forest cover categories and fish ages, although these categories were not robust indicators of O. mykiss condition and growth efficiency. Consumption estimates were generally less than 20% of maximum consumption, and fish lost weight in some streams during summer low-flow conditions when stream temperatures exceeded 15 degrees C, Current 100-year climate change projections for California threaten to exacerbate negative growth patterns and may undermine the productivity of this steelhead population, which is currently not listed as endangered or threatened. To demonstrate the potential effect of global warming on fish growth. we ran three climate change scenarios in two representative streams. Simulated temperature increases ranging from 1.4 degrees C to 5.5 degrees C during the summer and from 1.5 degrees C to 2.9 degrees C during the winter amplified the weight loss: estimated average growth for age-1 fish was 0.4-4.5 times lower than normal (low to high estimated temperature increase) in the warm stream and 0.05-0.8 times lower in the cool stream. We conclude that feeding rate and temperature during the summer currently limit the growth and productivity of steelhead and rainbow trout in low-order streams in the South Fork Trinity River basin and predict that climate change will have detrimental effects on steelhead growth as well as on macroinvertebrate communities and stream ecosystems in general.									39	0	0	0	39	0	42			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000268501100006		
J	Knutsen, I; Salvanes, AGV								Temperature-dependent digestion handling time in juvenile cod and possible consequences for prey choice								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				181				61	79		10.3354/meps181061				1999	1999	The paper combines experimental work with modelling. The aim was to estimate the temperature-dependent digestion handling time, which is defined as the time taken to digest the whole prey or the whole stomach contents, and to examine potential consequences of prey digestibility on prey choice. A surface-dependent digestion model that reflects the geometric shape of a piscivore prey was applied to experimental data representing the weight of prey remaining undigested at various points in time from the time at which the prey was first ingested. The fish used were juvenile cod fed different meal sizes of two-spotted goby Gobiusculus flavescens Fabricius at 4 temperatures. It is assumed that prey digestion is a surface process in which digestive enzymes attack progressively deeper into a prey of known size and shape so that the average digestion rate would be proportional to prey radius. This process is characterized by the digestion velocity d(s) (cm h(-1)) and the digestion handling time. d(s) was estimated for various meal sizes and temperatures. Next, these estimates were used to obtain a standardized temperature-dependent function: d(s) = d(s0)[e((ln3.41/10)T)], Of which the standardized digestion velocity estimate at 0 degrees C, d(s) = 0.0026 cm h(-1). The d(s) relation expresses the digestion velocity over a 10-fold meal size increase for a temperature range within natural seasonal variation for the cod. The digestion velocity d(s) was constant for a 10-fold difference in meal size within the temperature range. However, the digestion handling time increased with increasing meal size, but decreased with increasing temperature. It was demonstrated that predictions from a modified prey choice model which incorporates the effect of digestion differ from predictions from classical models which do not account for prey digestion.									24	1	0	0	23	1	25			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000080772700006

In previous work we established that increasing temperature led to a destabilization of the population dynamics of the invertebrate carnivore Mesostoma ehrenbergii and its prey Daphnia pulex, which ultimately resulted in the local extinction of Daphnia at higher temperatures. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the population-level phenomena: (1) quantitative changes in carnivore vital rates with Increasing temperature led to stronger functional and numerical response and (2) qualitative changes in the dynamic allocation of energy to reproduction by the predator with increasing temperature introduces inverse density dependence in the predator's response.2. The growth of individual M. ehrenbergii was monitored under various food conditions to determine the effect of two temperatures (18 and 24 degrees C) and five food levels on rates of growth, prey consumption and reproduction and on reproductive allocation patterns.3. The first mechanism was supported by both higher consumption rates (stronger functional response) and faster growth rates with earlier age at maturity and shorter generation time (stronger numerical response).4. Evidence for mechanism two was also provided by an alteration of the reproductive allocation pattern with temperature. Viviparous (subitaneous) eggs were more likely to be produced by this carnivore at low food levels at 24 degrees C, while at 18 degrees C, high food levels were required before individuals made this switch. This shift actually introduces inverse density dependence in the predator's numerical response which is highly destabilizing.5. Based on the results of this study, the differential effect of M. ehrenbergii on the dynamics and structure of its D. pulex prey populations can be attributed to changes in both physiological rates and reproductive allocation patterns with temperature.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0269-8463			WOS:A1997WR93700014		
J	Schmitz, Oswald J.; Rosenblatt, Adam E.; Smylie, Meredith								Temperature dependence of predation stress and the nutritional ecology of a generalist herbivore								ECOLOGY				97	11			3119	3130		10.1002/ecy.1524				NOV 2016	2016	Prey at risk of predation may experience stress and respond physiologically by altering their metabolic rates. Theory predicts that such physiological changes should alter prey nutrient demands from N-rich to C-rich macronutrients and shift the balance between maintenance and growth/reproduction. Theory further suggests that for ectotherms, temperature stands to exacerbate this stress. Yet, the interactive effects of predation stress and temperature stress on diet, metabolism, and survival of ectotherms are not well known. This knowledge gap was addressed with a laboratory study in which wild juvenile grasshoppers were collected, assigned to one of three groups, and raised at three different temperatures. All grasshoppers had access to equal quantities of two diets composed of opposite carbohydrate:protein ratios. Half of the individuals in each temperature group were exposed to predation risk cues from spider predators, while the other half were kept in risk free conditions. Grasshoppers consumed more carbohydrates when exposed to predation risk, but consumption favored greater protein intake as temperature increased. Moreover, the difference in carbohydrate intake between risk cue and risk free treatments diminished as temperature increased. Furthermore, variability between individual consumption patterns both within and between treatments decreased markedly as temperature increased, suggesting that higher temperatures promote more consistent individual consumption behaviors. Grasshoppers grew faster and larger as temperature increased, which translated into higher survival rates at higher temperatures. Warmer grasshoppers also did not alter their metabolic rates in response to predation risk cues, in contrast to colder grasshoppers. Digestive efficiency increased with temperature as well -- further indicating that lower temperatures were much more stressful than higher temperatures for grasshoppers. The study shows that physiological responses of ectothermic herbivores to predation stress are highly plastic and temperature dependent, with higher temperatures promoting increased protein intake, growth, development, survival, and digestive efficiency relative to colder temperatures. These findings help to reconcile why dietary responses (proportion of protein vs. carbohydrate intake) to predation stress may vary among different prey taxa studied previously.									30	0	0	0	28	0	30			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000387228200022	27870021

In marine intertidal systems, seawater temperature, low tide emersion temperature, and pH can drive variation in traits and affect species interactions. In western North America, Nucella dogwhelks are intertidal drilling predators of the habitat-forming mussel Mytilus californianus. Nucella exhibit local adaptation, but it is not known to what extent environmental factors and genetic structure contribute to variation in prey selectivity among populations. We surveyed drilled mussels at sites across Oregon and California, USA, and used multiple regression and Mantel tests to test the effects of abiotic factors and Nucella neutral genetic relatedness on the size of mussels drilled across sites. Our results show that Nucella at sites characterized by higher and less variable temperature and pH drilled larger mussels. Warmer temperatures appear to induce faster handling time, and more stable pH conditions may prolong opportunities for active foraging by reducing exposure to repeated stressful conditions. In contrast, there was no significant effect of genetic relatedness on prey size selectivity. Our results emphasize the role of climate in shaping marine predator selectivity on a foundation species. As coastal climates change, predator traits will respond to localized environmental conditions, changing ecological interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000512043400021	31932922

During 1933-1996, oceanic, coastal, and freshwater indices of climate were highly correlated, and an index for the Columbia River Basin suggested that climate shifts may have occurred about 1946, 1958, 1969, and 1977. Summer water temperature varied as much as 2 degreesC between climate periods. We used a bioenergetics model for northern squawfish, the most important piscivore, to predict that predation on salmonids would have been 26-31% higher during two periods with relatively warm spring-summer water temperatures (1933-1946, 1978-1996) than during an extremely cold period (1947-1958). Predicted predation rates of northern squawfish were 68-96% higher in the warmest year compared with the coldest year. Predation rates of smallmouth bass and walleye on juvenile salmonids varied among climate periods similar to rates predicted for northern squawfish. Climatic effects need to be understood in both freshwater and nearshore marine habitats, since growth rates of salmon populations are especially sensitive to mortality during early life stages.									71	1	0	0	66	0	78			0706-652X			WOS:000170811300014

Evidence suggests widespread non-additive effects between multiple drivers; most of this evidence, however, is based on species-level responses, which is problematic because community responses to environmental change also depend on species interactions. To address this knowledge gap, this study experimentally manipulated two physical drivers and examined the responses of a predator-prey interaction. The two drivers tested are fundamental in intertidal systems: air and water temperatures. The two species were the intertidal dogwhelk, Nucella ostrina, and its barnacle prey, Balanus glandula. The objective was to test alternative hypotheses that air and water warming have additive vs. non-additive effects on the whelk-barnacle interaction. A 14-day mesocosm experiment was conducted in which animals were subjected to one of four temperature treatments: ambient (no temperature manipulation; water 12 degrees C, air 13 degrees C), warm water (15 degrees C), warm air (27 degrees C), or combined (water 15 degrees C, air 27 degrees C). There were two key findings. First, air and water warming non-additively affected interaction strength: warm water mitigated a 35% decrease in mean whelk feeding rate caused by warm air. Second, air warming had contrasting effects on individual growth rates of predator and prey. While whelk growth decreased by similar to 60% in warm air, barnacle growth increased by 47%. These findings suggest that combined air and water warming will benefit barnacle populations more than their whelk predators. This study highlights the value of integrating species performances and interactions to understand how multiple physical drivers may affect community structure.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000429377700005

Effects of water temperature on growth of razorback sucker larvae								WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST				68	1			15	20		10.3398/1527-0904(2008)68[15:EOWTOG]2.0.CO;2				MAR 2008	2008	I conducted laboratory experiments and fit a response surface regression model to evaluate growth of endangered razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) tip to 37 days post-hatch. Fish growth at ad libitum ration was positively related to water temperature, and larvae reared at 25.5 degrees C grew about twice as fast in length and 4 times as fast in weight as those at 16.5 degrees C. Growth was intermediate at 19.5 degrees C and 22.5 degrees C. Time required for razorback sticker larvae to exceed 25 mm total length (TL), a potentially important threshold for reduced predation, was 30 days (post-hatch) at 25.5 degrees C, 33 days at 22.5 degrees C, 36 days at 19.5 degrees C, and 41 days at 16.5 degrees C. Time to exceed 25 mm TL increased to 52 days tinder a low growth rate of 0.29 mm.d(-1). Faster growth rates could reduce the time that razorback sucker larvae are vulnerable to predation by abundant and co-occurring small-bodied fish and invertebrate predators in nursery areas. Growth of razorback sticker larvae could be enhanced if flow re-regulation at Flaming Gorge Dam and downstream levee removal restored connections between the Green River and its floodplain and increased availability of warm and productive wetlands.									20	0	0	0	18	0	20			1527-0904			WOS:000255106600003

Effects of Climate-Related Stream Factors on Patterns of Individual Summer Growth of Cutthroat Trout								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				148	1			21	34		10.1002/tafs.10106				JAN 2019	2019	Coldwater fishes are sensitive to abiotic and biotic stream factors, which can be influenced by climate. Distributions of inland salmonids in North America have declined significantly, with many of the current strongholds located in small headwater systems that may serve as important refugia as climate change progresses. We investigated the effects of discharge, stream temperature, trout biomass, and food availability on summer growth of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri, a species of concern with significant ecological value. Individual size, stream discharge, sample section biomass, and temperature were all associated with growth, but had differing effects on energy allocation. Stream discharge had a positive relationship with growth rates in length and mass; greater rates of prey delivery at higher discharges probably enabled trout to accumulate reserve tissues in addition to structural growth. Temperature effects were positive but not significant, and support in growth models was limited, likely due to the cold thermal regimes of the study area. The strength of the discharge effect on growth suggests that climate adaptation strategies for coldwater fishes that focus solely on thermal characteristics may be misleading and highlights the importance of considering multiple factors, including hydrologic regimes, in conservation planning.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000456212400002		
J	Poeckl, Manfred								Success of the invasive Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus by life history traits and reproductive capacity								BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				11	9	SI		2021	2041		10.1007/s10530-009-9485-5				NOV 2009	2009	Dikerogammarus villosus originates from the Ponto-Caspian basin. In the Austrian stretch of the River Danube it was not found before 1989, and not before 1992 in the Bavarian Danube. It very quickly spread to Germany, the Netherlands, and France via the so called "Southern Corridor". The invader also migrates via the "Central Corridor", reaching as far west as the Vistula River. The species has been reported from a number of lakes. Reasons for the quick spread and high abundance are, beside others, its life history traits. A population of this invasive species was studied from 2002 to 2004 in the Austrian stretch of the Danube. The following life-history traits are important in the invasion success: long reproductive period, early sexual maturity, short generation time, a life span not exceeding 1 year (up to three generations and 14 cohorts being present at the same time), high growth rates resulting in large body size, short duration of embryonic development, large numbers of comparatively small eggs in the brood pouch, large reproductive capacity, and optimal timing to release the maximum number of neonates per female in May/June (maximising rapid growth at high summer temperatures and at times of plentiful food), increasing mating privilege for large specimens of both sexes with decreasing water temperatures during winter. These life cycle characteristics together with its predatory behaviour and its ability to cope with variation in oxygen, temperature and salinity, give this invader a potential to become distributed in freshwater ecosystems of the temperate climate zone all over the world. Additionally, several indications seem to prove the tendency that biological invasion and global warming have a positive feed-back on each other. This combined scenario is a huge threat to the indigenous aquatic fauna, and might contribute to bio-monotony.					15th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)15th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)	SEP 23-27, 2007SEP 23-27, 2007		Nijmegen, NETHERLANDSNijmegen, NETHERLANDS	46	0	0	0	47	0	49			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000270646300004

Indeed, numerous studies have documented how climate stressors affect species distributions and population persistence. However, relatively few studies have investigated how multiple climate stressors might affect species. In this study, we investigate the impacts of how two climate change factors affect an important foundation species. Specifically, we tested how ocean acidification from dissolution of CO2 and increased sea surface temperatures affect multiple characteristics of juvenile eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica). We found strong impacts of each stressor, but no interaction between the two. Simulated warming to mimic heat stressed summers reduced oyster growth, survival, and filtration rates. Additionally, we found that CO2-induced acidification reduced strength of oyster shells, which could potentially facilitate crab predation. As past studies have detected few impacts of these stressors on adult oysters, these results indicate that early life stages of calcareous marine organisms may be more susceptible to effects of ocean acidification and global warming. Overall, these data show that predicted changes in temperature and CO2 can differentially influence direct effects on individual species, which could have important implications for the nature of their trophic interactions.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2045-7758			WOS:000403273000017	28616177

ECOLOGY LETTERS				19	1			45	53		10.1111/ele.12541				JAN 2016	2016	Herbivory is more prevalent in the tropics than at higher latitudes. If differences in ambient temperature are the direct cause for this phenomenon, then the same pattern should be visible in a seasonal gradient, as well as in experiments manipulating temperature. Using N-15 stable isotope analyses of natural populations of the copepod Temora longicornis we indeed observed seasonal differences in the trophic level of the copepod and a decrease in trophic level with increasing temperature. In a grazing experiment, with a mixed diet of the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina and the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina, T. longicornis preferred the cryptophyte at higher temperatures, whereas at lower temperatures it preferred the non-autotrophic prey. We explain these results by the higher relative carbon content of primary producers compared to consumers, in combination with the higher demand for metabolic carbon at higher temperatures. Thus, currently increasing temperatures may cause changes in dietary preferences of many consumers.									45	3	0	0	43	1	47			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000368073000007	26567776

While field observations on organismic responses to heatwaves are emerging, experimental evidence is rare and almost lacking for shorter-scale environmental variability. For two major invertebrate predators, we simulated sinusoidal temperature variability (+/- 3 degrees C) around todays' warm summer temperatures and around a future warming scenario (+4 degrees C) over two months, based on high-resolution 15-year temperature data that allowed implementation of realistic seasonal temperature shifts peaking midpoint. Warming decreased sea stars' (Asterias rubens) energy uptake (Mytilus edulis consumption) and overall growth. Variability around the warming scenario imposed additional stress onto Asterias leading to an earlier collapse in feeding under sinusoidal fluctuations. High-peak temperatures prevented feeding, which was not compensated during phases of stress release (low-temperature peaks). In contrast, increased temperatures increased feeding on Mytilus but not growth rates of the recent invader Hemigrapsus takanoi, irrespective of the scale at which temperature variability was imposed. This study highlights species-specific impacts of warming and identifies temperature variability at the scale of days to weeks/months as important driver of thermal responses. When species' thermal limits are exceeded, temperature variability represents an additional source of stress as seen from future warming scenarios.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000560323100002	32321937

We performed CO2 perturbation experiments to investigate the effects of ocean acidification on the trophic interaction between the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus and the herbivorous isopod Idotea baltica. We predicted faster growth of F. vesiculosus at elevated CO2-concentrations and higher carbon content of the algal tissue. We expected that I. baltica has different consumption rates on algae that have been grown at different CO2 levels and that the isopods remove surplus carbon metabolically by enhanced respiration. Surprisingly, growth of F. vesiculosus as well as the C:N-ratio of the algal tissue were reduced at high CO2-levels. The changes in the elemental composition had no effect on the consumption rates and the respiration of the herbivores. An additional experiment showed that consumption of F. vesiculosus by the isopod Idotea emarginata was independent of ocean acidification and temperature. Our results could not reveal any effects of ocean acidification on the per capita strength of the trophic interaction between F. vesiculosus and its consumers. However, reduced growth of the algae at high CO2-concentrations might reduce the capability of the seaweed to compensate losses due to intense herbivory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the isolated and combined 7-day effects of increased temperature (+ 4 degrees C) and pCO(2) (similar to 1000 mu atm) on the trophic interaction Ulva sp./Trochus histrio, by assessing: i) topshells' survival and condition index; ii) grazer consumption rates, nutritional composition and interaction strength expressed as a dynamic index. No survival differences were observed whilst body condition varied significantly. Topshells under high pCO(2) displayed poor performance, concomitant with lower consumption of macroalgae. Individuals exposed to increased temperature had better physical condition, thus stimulating herbivory, which in turn was negatively correlated with carbon and nitrogen contents. The dynamic index was temperature- and pCO(2)(-) interactively dependent, suggesting lower grazing pressure under single acidification. Despite some limitations inherent to a short-term exposure, this study provides new insights to accurately predict tropical species' phenotypic responses in a changing ocean.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-326X	1879-3363		WOS:000457512500037	30660276

In Patagonia, Argentina, predicted increase in precipitation together with rapidly melting glaciers increase the surface runoff, and thereby the transport of suspended solids to recipient lakes. Suspended solids affect the visual conditions in the water which in turn restricts visual foraging. The native fish Aplochiton zebra Jenyns, and its filter-feeding cladoceran prey, Daphnia commutata Ekman, were subjected to foraging experiments at three turbidity levels. A. zebra foraging rate was substantially reduced at naturally occurring turbidity levels and the filtering rate of D. commutata was reduced at the highest turbidity level. This indicates that Daphnia may be partly released from predation from A. zebra at the same time as it can maintain relatively high feeding rates as turbidity increases. Lower foraging rates at the same time as the metabolic demand increases, through increased temperatures, may result in larger effects on A. zebra than could be expected from increases in turbidity or temperature alone. Turbidity may, as an indirect effect of climate change, decrease planktivore foraging rates and thereby alter the interaction strength between trophic levels.									15	1	0	0	16	1	17			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000286393300006		
J	Cannon, RJC								The implications of predicted climate change for insect pests in the UK, with emphasis on non-indigenous species								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				4	7			785	796		10.1046/j.1365-2486.1998.00190.x				OCT 1998	1998	Recent estimates for global warming predict increases in global mean surface air temperatures (relative to 1990) of between 1 and 3.5 degrees C, by 2100. The impact of such changes on agricultural systems in mid- to high-latitude regions are predicted to be less severe than in low-latitude regions, and possibly even beneficial, although the influence of pests and diseases is rarely taken into account. Most studies have concluded that insect pests will generally become more abundant as temperatures increase, through a number of inter-related processes, including range extensions and phenological changes, as well as increased rates of population development, growth, migration and overwintering. A gradual, continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 will affect pest species directly (i.e. the CO2 fertilization effect) and indirectly (via interactions with other environmental variables). However, individual species responses to elevated CO2 vary: consumption rates of insect herbivores generally increase, but this does not necessarily compensate fully for reduced leaf nitrogen. The consequent effects on performance are strongly mediated via the host species. Some recent experiments under elevated CO2 have suggested that aphids may become more serious pests, although other studies have discerned no significant effects on sap-feeding homopterans. However, few, if any of these experiments have fully considered the effects on pest population dynamics. Climate change is also considered from the perspective of changes in the distribution and abundance of species and communities. Marked changes in the distribution of well-documented species - including Odonata, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera - in northwestern Europe, in response to unusually hot summers, provide useful indications of the potential effects of climate change. Migrant pests are expected to respond more quickly to climate change than plants, and may be able to colonize newly available crops/habitats. Range expansions, and the removal of edge effects, could result in the increased abundance of species presently near the northern limits of their ranges in the UK. However, barriers to range expansions, or shifts, may include biotic (competition, predation, parasitism and disease), as well as abiotic, factors. Climatic phenomena, ecosystem processes and human activities are interactive and interdependent, making long-term predictions extremely tenuous. Nevertheless, it appears prudent to prepare for the possibility of increases in the diversity and abundance of pest species in the UK, in the context of climate change.									217	16	0	0	191	2	241			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000076557700008

Moreover, higher mean temperatures and increased frequency of climatic extremes are expected to induce different responses across trophic levels, potentially disrupting predator-prey interactions. Using field observations, we examined the response of an aphid host-parasitoid system to variation in temperature. Temperature was positively associated with attack rates by parasitoids, but also with a non-significant trend towards increased attack rates by higher-level hyperparasitoids. Elevated hyperparasitism could partly offset any benefit of climate warming to parasitoids, and would suggest that higher trophic levels may hamper predictions of predator-prey interactions. Additionally, the mechanisms affecting host-parasitoid dynamics were examined using controlled laboratory experiments that simulated both temperature increase and drought. Parasitoid fitness and longevity responded differently when exposed to each climatic variable in isolation, compared to the interaction of both variables at once. Although temperature increase or drought tended to positively affect the ability of parasitoids to control aphid populations, these effects were significantly reversed when the drivers were expressed in concert. Additionally, separate warming and drought treatments reduced parasitoid longevity, and although temperature increased parasitoid emergence success and drought increased offspring production, combined temperature and drought produced the lowest parasitoid emergence. The non-additive effects of different climate drivers, combined with differing responses across trophic levels, suggest that predicting future pest outbreaks will be more challenging than previously imagined.									59	5	0	0	54	0	65			1932-6203			WOS:000315637900093	23472147

Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), an imperiled species along the west coast of North America, undertake extensive coastal migrations and occupy estuaries during the summer and early fall. Warm water and abundant prey in estuaries may afford a growth opportunity. We applied a bioenergetics model to investigate how variation in estuarine temperature, spawning frequency, and duration of estuarine residence affect consumption and growth potential for individual green sturgeon. We assumed that green sturgeon achieve observed annual growth by feeding solely in conditions represented by Willapa Bay, Washington, an estuary annually frequented by green sturgeon and containing extensive tidal flats that harbor a major prey source (burrowing shrimp, Neotrypaea californiensis). Modeled consumption rates increased little with reproductive investment (< 0.4%), but responded strongly (10-50%) to water temperature and duration of residence, as higher temperatures and longer residence required greater consumption to achieve equivalent growth. Accordingly, although green sturgeon occupy Willapa Bay from May through September, acoustically-tagged individuals are observed over much shorter durations (34 d + 41 d SD, N = 89). Simulations of < 34 d estuarine residence required unrealistically high consumption rates to achieve observed growth, whereas longer durations required sustained feeding, and therefore higher total intake, to compensate for prolonged exposure to warm temperatures. Model results provide a range of per capita consumption rates by green sturgeon feeding in estuaries to inform management decisions regarding resource and habitat protection for this protected species.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000417067100004

Variation in the strength of predator-prey interactions often can be attributed to predator mass and prey mass, or abiotic factors like temperature. However, even when accounting for these factors, there remains a considerable amount of unexplained variation that may be attributed to other traits. We compiled functional response data from the literature to investigate how predator mass, prey mass, prey type (taxonomic identity), temperature, and prey defenses (hard vs soft integument) contributed to the variation found in the predator-prey interactions between freshwater cyclopoid copepods and their prey. Surprisingly, our results indicate that prey identity (taxonomic group) and defenses (hard vs soft integument) are more important for generating variation in interaction strengths than body mass and temperature. This suggests that allometric functions can only take us so far when attempting to better understand variation in individual predator prey interactions, and that we must evaluate how other traits influence interaction strengths. Identifying additional factors such as prey defenses may enable us to better predict potential changes in the structure and function of planktonic and other food webs by better accounting for the variation in the interactions between generalists and their many prey types.									30	1	0	0	28	0	29			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000368829300022	26552379

Larvae were starved for greater-than-or-equal-to 8 h prior to the experiment and only allowed to feed for less-than-or-equal-to 10 min during the experiment in order to minimize the influence of gut processing or satiation on feeding behaviour. Prey consumption (mug min-1) increased exponentially and prey capture success (%) increased logarithmically with mean walleye length. Prey consumption and attack rate (strikes min-1) increased significantly with increasing temperature. The effect of temperature on capture success was slight (2% increase from 15 to 22-degrees-C) and not significant. Walleye showed positive electivity for medium-sized prey (0.3-0.6 mm body width, mostly Ceriodaphnia quadrangula), negative electivity for small prey (< 0.3 mm, mostly cyclopoid copepods) and neutral electivity for large prey (greater-than-or-equal-to 0.6 mm, mostly Daphnia sp.). Neither prey species electivity nor prey size electivity were significantly affected by temperature. However, prey size electivity did show a fairly large effect size with respect to temperature and we suggest that this relationship should be examined further. These results indicate that temperature affects prey capture in walleye larvae primarily by influencing attack rate.									22	0	0	0	21	0	22			0378-1909			WOS:A1994NN69200008		
J	Hakala, T; Viitasalo, M; Rita, H; Aro, E; Flinkman, J; Vuorinen, I								Temporal and spatial variation in the growth rates of Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras L.) larvae during summer								MARINE BIOLOGY				142	1			25	33		10.1007/s00227-002-0933-3				JAN 2003	2003	It has been suggested that larval survival determines the year-class strength in most marine fish species. During their growth and development, the ability of the larvae to catch prey and avoid predation will increase. However, the factors affecting short-term changes in the growth of Baltic Sea herring have been little studied in the field. We collected Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras L.) larvae from five different towing areas in the Archipelago Sea (SW Finland) during May and June 1989, right after the main spawning season. Twenty thousand two hundred and ten larvae were analysed and the area-specific growth rate (i.e. increase in standard length) was estimated by tracing the larval cohorts from the length-frequency data. This represents the first Baltic herring study with daily sampling during a long study period. The growth rate was related to environmental factors, such as temperature, number of zooplankters, and wind speed and direction. Large variation in larval growth rate occurred between areas: lowest and highest growth rates were 0.18 and 0.52 mm(.)day(-1). Temperature was an important variable controlling larval-fish growth rate. An increase of one 1degreesC in average water temperature corresponded to an increase in growth rate of 0.043 mm(.)day(-1). This may have been caused either by a direct temperature effect (changes in metabolic rate) or by the indirect effect of changes in food availability. We also found the densest herring populations in the areas with highest average water temperature. However, temperature and larval growth rate both increased towards the inner archipelago.									18	0	0	0	13	0	18			0025-3162			WOS:000181017900003

Interaction strengths in turn influence the fate of pairwise interacting populations and the stability of food webs. Understanding the mechanisms relating individual phenotypic variation to interaction strengths is thus central to assess how trait variation affects population and community dynamics. We incorporated nonheritable variation in attack rates and handling times into a classical consumer-resource model to investigate how variation may alter interaction strengths, population dynamics, species persistence, and invasiveness. We found that individual variation influences species persistence through its effect on interaction strengths. In many scenarios, interaction strengths decrease with variation, which in turn affects species coexistence and stability. Because environmental change alters the direction and strength of selection acting upon phenotypic traits, our results have implications for species coexistence in a context of habitat fragmentation, climate change, and the arrival of exotic species to native ecosystems.									25	0	0	0	23	0	25			2045-7758			WOS:000342846600017	25478159

These predators have flexible feeding behaviours and often feed on large prey items. Digestion times of large prey are usually longer than handling times, and gut processing limits feeding rate at high prey density. Optimizing the gut content mix can therefore be an important behavioural strategy. Here, we develop a foraging model that incorporates gut processing and use the model to disentangle internal and external limitations on feeding in the omnivorous cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae). We extend the traditional definition of prey profitability to consider prey digestive quality, which we quantify for prey of Northeast Atlantic cod populations. We find an important role for gut limitation; within a range of ecologically relevant temperatures and prey densities, predicted feeding rates were strongly reduced compared to feeding constrained by external factors only, and the optimal diet composition under gut limitation differed from predictions from traditional foraging theory. Capelin, a main prey of Northeast Arctic cod, had the highest digestive quality of all prey across ecosystems, but the cold temperatures in the Barents Sea strongly limited feeding rate by slowing down digestion. Baltic cod fed on a higher proportion of poor-quality prey compared to the other populations, contributing to its slow growth in relation to water temperature. Gut limitation is particularly important to consider in foraging models for fish with many alternative prey species or fish occupying cold waters where digestion is slow.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1467-2960	1467-2979		WOS:000492163700001

To study the feeding ecology of juvenile herring we investigated prey availability and herring diets within four nursery areas from May 1996 to March 1998. Quality of nurseries was evaluated with respect to zooplankton community structure and variables affecting that community. Zooplankton distribution was significantly influenced by seasonal and annual environmental factors among bays in Prince William Sound. The diets of juvenile herring were examined and related to prey availability. Prey densities, incidence of feeding, and prey taxa richness increased during the spring months and were minimal during the winter. Prey selection was highest during the winter months when prey availability was lowest. Lower zooplankton densities in the fall of 1997 than in 1996 were correlated to warmer water temperatures. Consequently, feeding by juvenile herring decreased in the fall and winter of 1997-1998. Increased temperatures may be responsible for higher growth rates and higher winter survival of juvenile herring observed that year in Prince William Sound.

ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				71	8			2186	2197		10.1093/icesjms/fsu094				OCT 2014	2014	The southern-most stock of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), a cold temperate species of the Northwest Atlantic, has not recovered from overfishing despite continued restrictive measures, and appears to be contracting northward. We regressed larval and settled juvenile abundance (after accounting for adult and larval contribution to variation, respectively) on temperature over several decades from collections in New Jersey, the United States, at the southern edge of their range to determine if increasing temperatures during the first year of life were responsible for this contraction. A significant stock-recruitment relationship at both stages was moderate, explaining 27.5% of the variance for larvae on adults and 20.6% for juveniles on larvae. There was no significant effect of average monthly temperature in explaining variance of the residuals for larvae, or of degree day on explaining the abundance of residuals for juveniles over a months-long settlement period. However, in both cases, residuals were widely distributed at cold temperatures, while they were always low at warm temperatures. Thus, years in which spring temperatures were warm (5-7 degrees C for February, 7-9 for March, and 11-20 for May) always experienced poor recruitment. This threshold effect may result from an intersection with predators in response to temperature, and this may play a more important role than heat stress in determining recruitment success.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000343317100019

Despite the threat of climate change, the upper thermal tolerance of these species has been little studied. In this paper, we determine the lethal and sub-lethal thermal responses of year-0 juvenile red and blue king crab. Crab were exposed to a range of temperatures for 24 h to determine the lethal temperature at which mortality was 50% (LT50). Feeding rations were determined at sub-lethal temperatures for both species. Finally, crab were held for 45 days at sub-lethal temperatures and growth and long-term mortality rates were measured. The LT(50)s of red and blue king crab were 24.3 and 21.3 degrees C, respectively. Feeding ration peaked between 12 and 17 degrees C for red king crab and between 5 and 10 degrees C for blue king crab. The growth rate of red king crab decreased at temperatures above 12 degrees C, while blue king crab exhibited very low growth rates at temperatures 12 degrees C and above. Increased mortality in the 45-day experiment occurred for red king crab at 20 degrees C and blue king crab at 17 degrees C. This study suggests that, within their current distribution, the juveniles of both species could withstand warming of several degrees and not be thermally stressed; however, more research into the effect of increased temperature variability and other response variables, such as resting and active respiration, is needed. In addition, increased temperature could affect other life-history stages differently or have indirect effects, such as altered species interactions and food availability.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000406280200006

Warming of subtropical coastal waters accelerates Mnemiopsis leidyi growth and alters timing of spring ctenophore blooms								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				502				105	115		10.3354/meps10739				2014	2014	Shifts in the size, frequency, or timing of gelatinous zooplankton blooms in response to climate variability and climate change have become a concern in many coastal marine ecosystems worldwide. When abundant, gelatinous zooplankton can induce trophic cascades as well as alter energy flows to upper-level consumers. To quantify the role water temperature plays in regulating bloom development of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in subtropical coastal waters, we experimentally determined the effects of increases in temperature and rates of warming on growth rate (mg C d(-1)). Conditions were representative of those occurring during late winter and early spring (January to April) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. M. leidyi growth rates increased exponentially with temperature (9, 13, 16, and 22 degrees C) and rates of warming (+1, +2, and +3 degrees C wk(-1)). A biologically important temperature threshold (15.0 degrees C, delineating negative and positive growth) as a proxy measure for bloom initiation was applied to a time-series of sea surface temperature (1975 to 2013) from Mobile Bay (Alabama, USA) and indicated climate-related warming of northern Gulf of Mexico has likely advanced the timing of the spring M. leidyi bloom over the past 39 yr. Results have implications for ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management since larger ctenophore blooms, occurring earlier in the year, would be expected to intensify potential competitive and predatory interactions between M. leidyi, zooplankton, and planktivorous juvenile fish utilizing nearshore waters as nursery habitat during the late winter and early spring.									10	0	1	0	9	0	11			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000334670700008

We documented the thermal limits of larvae of three amphibian species native to Hong Kong, and their introduced, invasive predator, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0-21.6 degrees C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions. This could mean a reduction in their capacity to deal with other stressors such as pollution and predators, and that G. affinis may have an advantage over native amphibians.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4565			WOS:000466820900020	30975413

These represent most of the ranges in bloater size and temperature likely to be encountered in Lake Michigan. Bloaters were raised from eggs in the laboratory and acclimated to test temperatures for 22-23 d prior to the experiments. Maximum daily consumption rates were determined by feeding the fish surplus amounts of brine shrimp Artemia sp. at 4-h intervals for 24 h. Specific daily ration increased with temperature up to 16-degrees-C for all size-groups. At 12 and 16-degrees-C, the maximum daily ration of small bloaters (about 1 g) exceeded 120% of body weight per day (based on wet weight; equivalent to 79%/d based on dry weight); the maximum daily ration of large bloaters (over 100 g) ranged between 5 and 12%/d (2-7%/d based on dry weight). As percentage of maximum consumption at 16-degrees-C, consumption rates averaged 82% at 12-degrees-C, 45% at 8-degrees-C, and 28% at 4-degrees-C. These results can be described by the equation: C(max) = 1.61 . W-0.138. F(T), where C(max) is specific maximum consumption rate (g.g-1.d-1), W is fish weight (g), and F(T) is a dome-shaped temperature dependence function with an optimum temperature of 16.8-degrees-C (R2 = 0.957, N = 27).									20	0	0	0	17	0	20			0002-8487			WOS:A1994NT40400006

We created a biophysical individual-based model which included the effects of body size and temperature on development, growth and mortality rates of eggs, larvae and juveniles of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) in the North Sea. Temperature-dependent mortality rates in our model were based on the consumption rate of predators of cod early-life stages. The model predicted 35%, 53% and 12% of the total mortality to occur during the egg, larval and juvenile stages, respectively. A comparison of modeled and observed body size suggested that the growth of survivors through their first year of life is high and close to the growth rates in adlibitum feeding laboratory experiments. Furthermore, our model indicates that experiencing warmer temperatures during early life only benefits young cod (or theoretically any organism) if a high ratio exists between the temperature coefficients for the rate of growth and the rate of mortality. During the egg stage of cod, any benefit of developing more rapidly at warmer temperatures is largely counteracted by temperature-dependent increases in predation pressure. In contrast, juvenile (age-0) cod experiences a higher cumulative mortality at warmer temperatures in the North Sea. Thus, our study adds a new aspect to the growth-survival' hypothesis: faster growth is not always profitable for early-life stages particularly if it is caused by warmer temperatures.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000373924300001		
J	MALLOY, KD; TARGETT, TE								FEEDING, GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF JUVENILE SUMMER FLOUNDER PARALICHTHYS-DENTATUS - EXPERIMENTAL-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				72	3			213	223		10.3354/meps072213				JUN 1991	1991	Laboratory experiments were conducted on juvenile summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus (41 to 80 mm total length) to determine low temperature tolerance (2 to 3-degrees-C) at 10, 20, and 30 parts per thousand salinity, and to measure feeding rate, assimilation efficiency, growth rate and growth efficiency at 2, 6, 10, 14, 18-degrees-C and 10, 20 and 30 parts per thousand salinity. There was 100 % survival at temperatures above 3-degrees-C, suggesting that juvenile summer flounder are able to survive most winter water temperatures encountered in north/central Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) estuaries. Mortality was 42 % after 16 d at 2 to 3-degrees-C, and was highest in fish < 50 mm TL (1 g). Mean specific growth rates were not significantly different between 2 and 10-degrees-C (mean = 0.14 % d-1), and these rates were not significantly different from zero. Mean growth rate increased to 2.4 % d-1 at 14-degrees-C and 3.8 % d-1 at 18-degrees-C. Ad libitum feeding rate showed a similar relationship to temperature. Mean assimilation efficiency (60.1 %) was not affected by temperature. Mean growth efficiency (K1) was significantly lower at 6-degrees-C (-23.1 %) than at 14 and 18-degrees-C (18.4 and 22.1 %, respectively), and was highly variable. Salinity had no significant effect on any parameters measured, suggesting that factors other than salinity are controlling spatial distributions. Mortality resulting from acute exposure to low temperature probably occurs during one 2 to 4 wk period each winter. Recruitment success from north/central MAB estuaries may be lower in years with late winter cold periods (i.e. March vs December) due to increased numbers of fish being exposed to lethal low temperatures. Additional mortality probably results from low growth rates caused by sub-optimal temperatures (i. e. < 10-degrees-C) throughout the spring. The annual contribution of new recruits from northern estuaries appears to be dependent on winter temperature regime, particularly on the magnitude and timing of temperature minima.									90	9	0	0	86	0	100			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1991FR47100002

However, the feeding behavior of this species remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the influence of water temperature, habitat type, light intensity and photoperiod on the predatory performance of dark sleepers against juvenile demersal mrigal carp [Cirrhinus mrigala(Hamilton, 1822)] in the laboratory. Our results showed that both the prey consumption and the feeding rate of dark sleepers increased significantly with increases in water temperature (22-34 degrees C) and stabilized between 26-34 degrees C. Additionally, both the prey consumption and the feeding rate were higher in vegetated habitats than those in open areas at 22-30 degrees C, although no significant differences were detected. The prey consumption and the feeding rate of dark sleepers increased significantly with decreased light intensity (0-1350 lx) and shortened light duration (0-14 h), indicating that this fish prefers feeding in dark environments. These results will help elucidate the influence of environmental variables on this species' predatory performance and create suitable protocols for its culture.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0270-5060	2156-6941		WOS:000567920500001

In experiments with Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula feeding on zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha in outdoor cages, we measured changes in food consumption and diving behaviour in relation to water temperature (3-22 degrees C). Water efflux and daily energy expenditure (DEE) were measured using doubly-labelled water. Tufted Ducks swallow mussels whole and crush the shells in the gizzard. Due to the low flesh content of mussels, daily mussel consumption was extremely high in winter (up to 3 times the duck body mass of 600 g). Water efflux was 6.5 to 13 limes higher than allometrically predicted, with a maximum of 1.1 1 d(-1). Because of high water turnover rates, DEE estimates from doubly-labelled water measurements were variable, but on average agreed with DEE estimates obtained from food consumption and time-energy budgets (ca. 5% higher values). DEE increased with lower temperatures from 2.5 (summer, 20 degrees C) to more than 4 times the basal metabolic rate (winter, 3 degrees C). Costs of thermoregulation and heating up ingested mussels (as estimated from the theoretical caloric heat) primarily explained the high DEE in winter. At lower temperatures, dive duration was shorter and less time was spent selecting small mussels at the bottom, while more larger mussels were brought up and were ingested at the water surface. Thereby, the energy costs of crushing shells probably increased in favour of reducing diving costs. The narrow margins of the energy budget, wherein feeding costs must be balanced, imply that food availability and water temperature are important attributes to winter distributions of diving ducks.									22	0	0	0	22	0	23			0908-8857			WOS:000080855100008

While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short (<1-2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long-term changes in mean annual temperature might change aphid-parasitoid population cycles, a question which we further pursued with laboratory experiments. To quantify temperature-dependent demographic parameters, we used short-term (<1 generation) experiments conducted at 20 degrees C and 27 degrees C. The higher temperature increased aphid and parasitoid development rates, adult aphid life span and fecundity, and parasitoid attack rates. We then conducted multi-generation population-level laboratory experiments to reveal the effects of temperature (20 degrees C vs. 27 degrees C) on population dynamics. We fit the resulting time series data using a nonlinear age-structured state-space model to estimate population-level processes that could not be estimated in short-term laboratory experiments. Using the model, we parsed out the demographic rates that had the largest impacts on aphid-parasitoid population cycles. This analysis showed that there were frequent contrasts in the effects of temperature operating through different demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate decreased cycle amplitude, while the increase in parasitoid attack rate increased cycle amplitude: There were also striking interactions among demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate could either increase or decrease the cycle period depending on the values of other demographic rates. Although these complexities make predictions difficult, overall they suggest that increasing long-term mean temperature will decrease the period, increase the amplitude, and tend to destabilize pea aphid-A. ervi dynamics.									20	1	0	0	15	0	20			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000340081900005

Several studies have assessed the value of restored tidal wetlands for juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., but few have used integrative measures of salmon performance, such as habitat-specific growth potential, to evaluate restoration. Our study took place in the Nisqually River delta, Washington, where recent dike removals restored tidal flow to 364 ha of marsh-the largest tidal marsh restoration project in the northwestern contiguous United States. We sampled fish assemblages, water temperatures, and juvenile Chinook Salmon diet composition and consumption rates in two restored and two reference tidal channels during a 3-year period after restoration; these data were used as inputs to a bioenergetics model to compare Chinook Salmon foraging performance and growth potential between the restored and reference channels. We found that foraging performance and growth potential of juvenile Chinook Salmon were similar between restored and reference tidal channels. However, Chinook Salmon densities were significantly lower in the restored channels than in the reference channels, and growth potential was more variable in the restored channels due to their more variable and warmer (2 degrees C) water temperatures. These results indicate that some-but not all-ecosystem attributes that are important for juvenile Pacific salmon can recover rapidly after large-scale tidal marsh restoration.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000345706800011

Oyster drill prey selection was assessed in terms of prey (oyster) size and shell thickness. Drills fed on oysters with thinner shells 86% of the time and selectively preyed on smaller (1 g wet weight) oysters during colder months and larger (10 g wet weight) oysters during warmer months. Analysis of U. cinerea seasonal feeding patterns showed virtually no feeding during winter months (January to March) and a significant increase to over 1 gram of prey tissue per week during summer (July to September). A nine month experiment compared feeding rates of U. cinerea at two different temperature levels: ambient seawater (control) and temperatures elevated 4 degrees C above ambient. Oyster drills showed a 60% increase in feeding rate in the warmer treatment, especially during late summer, fall and early winter. Both temperature manipulation and annual feeding experiments revealed a significant temperature dependence of U. cinerea feeding rates. Seasonal or long-term seawater temperature changes related to climate change could strongly affect the predator-prey relationship between U. cinerea and its prey. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These forests are not only subject to the direct negative effects of ocean climate change, but also to a combination of unknown indirect effects associated with changing ecological landscapes. Here, we used mesocosm experiments to test the direct effects of ocean warming and acidification on kelp biomass and photosynthetic health, as well as climate-driven disparities in indirect effects involving key consumers (urchins and rock lobsters) and competitors (algal turf). Elevated water temperature directly reduced kelp biomass, while their turf-forming competitors expanded in response to ocean acidification and declining kelp canopy. Elevated temperatures also increased growth of urchins and, concurrently, the rate at which they thinned kelp canopy. Rock lobsters, which are renowned for keeping urchin populations in check, indirectly intensified negative pressures on kelp by reducing their consumption of urchins in response to elevated temperature. Overall, these results suggest that kelp forests situated towards the low-latitude margins of their distribution will need to adapt to ocean warming in order to persist in the future. What is less certain is how such adaptation in kelps can occur in the face of intensifying consumptive (via ocean warming) and competitive (via ocean acidification) pressures that affect key ecological interactions associated with their persistence. If such indirect effects counter adaptation to changing climate, they may erode the stability of kelp forests and increase the probability of regime shifts from complex habitat-forming species to more simple habitats dominated by algal turfs.									32	0	0	0	31	0	32			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000390218300030	27392308

For ectotherms, life history strategies are highly dependent on temperature, among other environmental conditions. With projected increases in global temperatures, understanding the success of organisms under warmer conditions is critical. Due to the difficulty of establishing long-term heating studies on whole lake systems, there is little empirical evidence addressing the potential changes in life history strategies of fish in situ in response to future climate warming predictions. Here, we study early growth rates, size-at-maturation, maximum adult size, and lifespan of bluegill sunfish in three lakes in Illinois from 2013 to 2017 that experience above-ambient temperatures year-round due to artificial heating by electrical power plant cooling systems and compare these to populations in three nearby ambient lakes. Temperature changes in the heated lakes are within the range of temperature increases predicted by the year 2100. We find evidence that life history strategies and population demographics are substantially affected by warmer environments. Heated populations showed 22% faster first-year growth, 23% shorter lifespans, greater rates of maturation at small body sizes, and over a 4-fold reduction in the relative number of individuals that reach large sizes. Changes in life history strategies, including lifespan and maximum sizes, will be evident across many fish species under warmer conditions in the future and further research should aim to address how these changes will affect trophic interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000558613600001		
J	Riessen, Howard P.								Water temperature alters predation risk and the adaptive landscape of induced defenses in plankton communities								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				60	6			2037	2047		10.1002/lno.10150				NOV 2015	2015	Water temperature influences many biological processes in zooplankton, including those that affect interactions with predators. These relationships help shape the impact of predation and the development of prey defenses. Many freshwater zooplankton develop induced morphological defenses in response to the presence of various invertebrate predators, a phenomenon that often has a seasonal pattern (cyclomorphosis) in which defenses are enhanced during summer when temperatures are highest. Here, I examine this relationship of water temperature to predation risk and the development of induced defenses by developing a life history model for the common pond-dwelling water flea, Daphnia pulex and its response to predation by larvae of the phantom midge, Chaoborus, which involves the induction of defensive neck spines in the presence of predator kairomones. The model analyzes the influence of water temperature on Daphnia instar development time and body size, and on the encounter rate between Daphnia and Chaoborus, all of which affect the vulnerability of Daphnia to this gape-limited ambush predator. It then assesses the costs and benefits of neck spine development, and thus its fitness consequences, in different temperature environments. Higher water temperatures increase predation risk for Daphnia, resulting in greater fitness advantages in producing induced defenses, but only at relatively high predator densities. This effect is greater at higher levels of food resources for the prey. These results demonstrate the importance of water temperature in influencing predation in plankton communities and help explain the phenomenon of cyclomorphosis in zooplankton, in which induced morphological defenses are limited to summer.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000363888400013

There are indications that these species respond to qualitative and phenological changes in the zooplankton. If so, the climate-induced alterations of the local copepod communities that we see in temperate and arctic regions may influence the energy flux in marine food chains. In order to investigate how different processes contribute to the relationship between copepod size and fish growth, we merged 2 mechanistic models from relevant data: (1) a model of the bioenergetics and stomach filling/evacuation dynamics, and (2) a Holling type II functional response model that encompasses visual range from basic principles. The model predicts that going from a situation where large Calanus copepods (2 mm) dominate the prey field of lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus in the central North Sea to a situation where only relatively small (1 mm) and less energy-rich copepods are available roughly halves the energy intake of sandeels even if prey biomass concentration remains constant. Visual constraint on foraging was the most important factor, followed by handling time limitation and prey energy content. These limitations became stronger with increasing fish length, showing that copepod size and energy content have a strong effect on the specific growth potential of these fish.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000349302600016		
J	Bashevkin, Samuel M.; Pechenik, Jan A.					Bashevkin, Samuel/0000-0001-7406-7089			The interactive influence of temperature and salinity on larval and juvenile growth in the gastropod Crepidula fornicata (L.)								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				470				78	91		10.1016/j.jembe.2015.05.004				SEP 2015	2015	Sea surface temperatures have been rising and are predicted to continue rising in coming years because of global warming. In addition, salinity has been decreasing in high latitudes and is expected to continue decreasing due to altered precipitation patterns and glacial melting caused by climate change. Many marine organisms that are adapted to the present conditions may be drastically affected by these oceanic changes. Early life stages (larvae and juveniles) should be especially susceptible, since they do not yet have the fully developed morphological defenses of adults. This study investigated the effects of reduced salinity (20 compared to a control of 30) and altered temperature (15, 20, 25, and 29 degrees C) on the growth, percent inorganic content (representing shell calcification), and feeding rates of larvae and juveniles of the widespread coastal snail Crepidula fornicata. Both larval and juvenile growth rates were significantly depressed at low salinity and lower temperatures. In addition, the salinity that snails were exposed to as larvae significantly impacted their juvenile growth rates in 4 out of 6 treatments, an example of latent effects. The magnitude and direction of this effect were strongly impacted by temperature and parentage. Juvenile feeding rates were significantly depressed following a rapid change in salinity but then gradually recovered to near initial levels over 3 h. There was little difference in the percent inorganic content of juveniles but for larvae that had been reared at 20 degrees C, percent inorganic content was 27% lower for those reared at a salinity of 20 compared with those reared at 30. In conclusion, the early life stages of C. fornicata may experience more favorable conditions in a warmer future: growth rates will increase, probably making larvae and juveniles less vulnerable to size-specific predation. Conversely, in regions where salinity is decreasing, C. fornicata larvae and juveniles will likely grow more slowly, thereby increasing predation risk by forcing them to spend more time at more vulnerable smaller sizes. Thus, the future of C fornicata and their potential to continue invading new habitats will depend greatly on the specific salinity and temperature conditions they will be exposed to throughout larval and juvenile development.

The potential predation impact ofA. coeruleaon zooplankton was investigated. Population clearance potential and residence time (t(1/2)) for copepods were calculated from laboratory clearance rates and measurements of jellyfish size and abundance from May to August 2009 in Jiaozhou Bay. Clearance rates varied widely with prey organisms, but they were not significantly different among various prey concentrations. Medusae captured rotifers, fish larvae and hydromedusae more efficiently than fish eggs, copepods and chaetognaths. Ephyrae captured rotifers and hydromedusae more efficiently than fish larvae and copepods. Clearance rate linearly increased with the cross sectional area ofA. coerulea(size from 0.3 to 7.1 cm). Water temperature also had a marked effect on clearance rate and this was related to the increased beat frequency as water temperature increased. In early May 2009,A. coeruleapotentially cleared the volume of water in the Bay less than 0.001 times a day, but this value was estimated to be more than 0.3 times a day in July. Thet(1/2)for copepods was less than 6 d in June and July. Abundances of copepods, hydromedusae and chaetognaths were extremely low in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2010 (jellyfish non-bloom years). Large predation pressure by theA. coeruleapopulation occurred to control zooplankton communities in Jiaozhou Bay.A. coerulea, when present at a high population level, can be a keystone species in Jiaozhou Bay and control the trophic structure here.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2096-5508	2523-3521		WOS:000551529700023

We assessed the effects of temperature on the growth rates of all three species with the objective of developing a model with four differential equations based on the experimental data. The following hypotheses were tested at a theoretical level: Firstly, temperature changes can affect the dynamic behavior of a system by temperature-dependent parameters and interactions and secondly, food web response to temperature cannot be derived from the single species temperature response. The main outcome of the study is that temperature changes affect the parameter range where coexistence is possible within all three species. This has significant consequences on our ideas regarding the evaluation of effects of global warming.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000310586900006

But with species redistributions associated with climate change, the response by endemic predators within an AIGP context to changing biotic-abiotic conditions over time (i.e. seasonal and decadal) has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, little is known on AIGP dynamics in ecosystems undergoing rapid directional change such as the Arctic. Here, we investigate the flexibility of AIGP among two predators in the same trophic guild: beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), by season and over 30 years in Cumberland Sound-a system where forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) have recently become more available. Using stable isotopes, we illustrate different predator responses to temporal shifts in forage fish availability. On a seasonal cycle, beluga consumed less Greenland halibut and increased consumption of forage fish during summer, contrasting a constant consumption rate of forage fish by Greenland halibut year-round leading to decreased AIGP pressure between predators. Over a decadal scale (1982-2012), annual consumption of forage fish by beluga increased with a concomitant decline in the consumption of Greenland halibut, thereby indicating decreased AIGP pressure between predators in concordance with increased forage fish availability. The long-term changes of AIGP pressure between endemic predators illustrated here highlights climate-driven environmental alterations to interspecific intraguild interactions in the Arctic.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000416597400006	29118241

The smallmouth bass were allowed to feed voluntarily after 24-48 h of starvation and stomachs were pumped at intervals of 1-4 h until 90% of the stomach contents were evacuated (E90). Evacuation approximated an S-shaped curve over time, and a sigmoid model was developed to predict evacuation at varying water temperatures, total meal weights, predator sizes, and prey number. The rate of evacuation increased with increasing water temperature, meal weight, or predator size. The E90 increased with larger meal weights but decreased with increasing temperature or predator size. E90 ranged between 4 and 95 h, depending upon conditions. E90 was slower than those estimated previously for another predator of salmon, the stomachless northern squawfish (Ptychocheilus oregonensis).									27	0	0	0	26	0	28			0706-652X			WOS:A1991FP95300022

In an effort to improve our understanding of the life history characters that facilitated this unprecedented invasion, we performed a mark-release-recapture study with 36 tagged individuals to document life history characteristics of the Red Sea lionfish, Pterois miles, in its native habitat. Monthly growth rates of juveniles ranged from 4.0 to 10.8mmmonth(-1) independent of water temperature. Highest juvenile growth rates (>9.0mmmonth(-1)) occurred between May and August when water temperature increased from 22.5 to 28.0 degrees C, while growth rates dropped sharply between August and September when water temperature was consistently high. Adult lionfish had relatively constant growth rates of 4-6mmmonth(-1). Despite high site fidelity of some individuals, recapture success gradually declined from 83 to 3% during the 15-month study period. Thus, the consistent population density of 95 fish ha(-1) likely reflected a well-balanced exchange of individuals with adjacent reef habitats. To identify biotic constraints that may limit native lionfish populations, interactions with seven potential predatory and/or competitive grouper species were also investigated. Significantly, fewer lionfish were encountered in micro-habitats, where the Red Sea groupers Aethaloperca rogaa and Cephalopholis miniata resided. In addition, the presence of large groupers (>250mm TL) was significantly correlated with reduced numbers of lionfish, while small groupers (250mm TL) appeared to have no impact. Our field observations suggest that the biotic interactions (e.g., habitat competition, and depredation) between grouper species and lionfish may play a role in lionfish distribution. This study provides new insights into the growth and ecology of lionfish in their native habitats to help illuminate links to their documented success in the invaded range.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000447655800001

We re-analyze literature data and present our own results on growth rates of larvae of 14 species of Libellulidae reared at different temperatures. Temperature response curves (TRC) were fitted in order to estimate two relevant components of the thermal reaction, namely the optimum temperature for growth (T-opt) and the increase of growth rate with temperature (Q(10)). We also examined what is known about the thermal minimum (T-min) and the thermal maximum (T-max) for growth to delimit the thermal ranges of odonates. All information indicates that larval growth is generally warm adapted, with species-specific variation of T-opt of 21-31 degrees C, T-min of 8-12 degrees C, and T-max of up to 44 degrees C (the latter being the upper lethal limit, the true T-max for growth remains unknown). The values of Q(10) distinguish some more specialized species, mostly with high T-opt and of tropical origin, and others being more thermal generalists, often being temperate species and/or from lotic habitats. We examine some biotic and abiotic factors affecting the temperature response of growth and we discuss the temperature response in the light of global warming.									21	0	1	0	24	0	25			1388-7890	2159-6719		WOS:000353767400003		
J	Sreenivasan, Ashwin; Heintz, Ron								Estimation of the relationship between growth, consumption, and energy allocation in juvenile pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) as a function of temperature and ration								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY				132				154	161		10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.04.004				OCT 2016	2016	Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) are generalist predators in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and are an important predator on other commercially important species. Efficient management of this species can benefit by knowing how these fish adapt to changing environmental conditions, with a focus on how growth and condition are affected by changes in temperature and diet. We conducted a feeding study to understand the relationship between growth, ration, and temperature, and how these factors interact to affect energy allocation strategies. Since growth and condition of juveniles can determine recruitment into the population, this study focused on growth and consumption of age 1+Pacific cod held over 4 temperature treatments (4 degrees C, 8 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 16 degrees C) and 3 ration levels (unlimited ration, medium ration, and low ration). We also compared cellular nucleic acid (RNA/DNA) ratios, an instantaneous growth index, total-body lipid, and proximate composition between fish. At 4 degrees C, 8 degrees C, and 12 degrees C, fish at medium and low rations had higher growth rates relative to fish at high rations. Higher food consumption appears to negatively affect digestive ability, assimilation efficiency, and nutrient utilization. RNA/DNA was clearly correlated with growth rates at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C, but this relationship did not hold at higher temperatures. A secondary growth study was conducted to test the reliability of the growth/consumption models derived from the main growth study. Temperature influenced energy reserves (lipid) while tissue growth (protein) was influenced by ration level. Average lipid values were higher at 4 degrees C than at 8 degrees C or 12 degrees C, suggesting a predisposition to heightened lipid synthesis at colder temperatures. Longer durations of warmer water temperature in the GOA could consequently affect energy allocation strategies, with dietary changes in the field potentially amplifying this effect in cold and warm years. This energy allocation strategy could be detrimental with warmer temperatures predicted in the GOA.

To this effect, we coupled a size structured population model for the consumer and a quality structured resource model for its main resource, leaf litter standing stock. We introduced temperature dependence of processes and a lumped internal energy storage for reproduction and energy reallocation. One-year's field data on body length frequencies of G. pulex, in-stream leaf litter standing stock, leaf fall and temperature were used to calibrate the model for parameters not yet determined in independent experiments. The model reproduced the seasonal pattern of both dynamics acceptably. Independently measured feeding rates of G. pulex were used to confirm the simulated relationship between resource and consumer. Such, we revealed the contribution of temperature and food response to changes in population density. Temperature effects of mortality and reproduction roughly concur with each other, while the energy response of reproduction is pivotally distinct. In the face of model application for projection of climate change effects, further attention should particularly be paid to the specific temperature response of G. pulex and to the contribution of non-shredding decomposition (physical abrasion and microbial colonization) to loss of leaf litter standing stock.

J	OBRIEN, CJ								POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF JUVENILE TIGER PRAWNS PENAEUS-ESCULENTUS IN SOUTH QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				104	3			247	256		10.3354/meps104247				FEB 1994	1994	A 2 yr study of the prawn population on a south Queensland seagrass bed between September 1988 and September 1990 provided information on the settlement, emigration, growth and mortality of juvenile brown tiger prawns (= shrimp) Penaeus esculentus. Prawns were sampled with a beam trawl at 2 wk intervals. In 1988/89 and 1989/90 respectively, 10 and 9 cohorts of small juveniles (2 to 3 mm carapace length, CL) settled between September and July; peaks in the settlement occurred from September to November and February to March, Carapace length-frequency analysis was used to estimate the rates of growth and mortality of these cohorts. Growth of P. esculentus juveniles was strongly influenced by water temperature. Growth rates increased from 0.03 to 2.1 mm CL wk(-1) with increasing temperature and can be described by the equation: GR = 0.00044e(0.317) where GR = growth rate (mm CL wk(-1)) and T = water temperature (degrees C). Weekly instantaneous natural mortality rates were estimated for a maximum of 10 wk after settlement and ranged from M = 0.06 to 0.29, or 5.8 to 25.2 %. Cohorts which settled in the summer (December to February) tended to have higher mortality rates. Overall, the mortality rates were lower than reported for other species of Penaeus and this was attributed to little fish predation due to the low natural density of P. esculentus and the lush seagrass cover in this area. As the mortality rates appear to be independent of water temperature and relatively low, the production of adult P. esculentus in the Moreton Bay fishery will be strongly influenced by the number and size of cohorts of juveniles settling in the nursery areas and their growth.									40	0	0	0	39	0	41			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1994MV57400004		
J	Ahti, Pauliina A.; Kuparinen, Anna; Uusi-Heikkila, Silva								Size does matter - the eco-evolutionary effects of changing body size in fish								ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS				28	3			311	324		10.1139/er-2019-0076				SEP 2020	2020	Body size acts as a proxy for many fitness-related traits. Body size is also subject to directional selection from various anthropogenic stressors such as increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, fisheries, as well as natural predators. Changes in individual body size correlate with changes in fecundity, behaviour, and survival and can propagate through populations and ecosystems by truncating age and size structures and changing predator-prey dynamics. In this review, we will explore the causes and consequences of changing body size in fish in the light of recent literature and relevant theories. We will investigate the central role of body size in ecology by first discussing the main selective agents that influence body size: fishing, increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, and predation. We will then explore the impacts of these changes at the individual, population, and ecosystem levels. Considering the relatively high heritability of body size, we will discuss how a change in body size can leave a genetic signature in the population and translate to a change in the evolutionary potential of the species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1208-6053	1181-8700		WOS:000563772300008

To maximize the use of A. gifuensis for biological control of M. persicae, the functional response of A. gifuensis using M. persicae as a host was determined at 4 constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and 20 host densities (5, 10, 15, increased incrementally by 5, to a maximum of 100) on a 6-leaf sweet pepper plant (30 cm in height) over a 24 h period. Roger's random parasitoid equation (RRPE) and Holling's disc equation (HDE) were used to fit the data. The results showed that functional responses at all temperatures were type II, and the instantaneous attack rate (a) in both models increased as temperature increased from 15 to 25 degrees C and then decreased at 30 degrees C. The highest instantaneous attack rate (a) for A. gifuensis was at 25 degrees C for the 2 models, 1.3203 +/- 0.0415 d(-1) for HDE and 4.295e+03 d(-1) for RRPE. The handling time (T-h) for A. gifuensis by HDE was between 0.0105 +/- 0.0002 d at 20 degrees C and 0.0214 +/- 0.0009 d at 30 degrees C and by RRPE was between 1.265e-02 +/- 3.808e-04 d at 20 degrees C and 0.0218 +/- 0.0010 d at 30 degrees C. Aphidius gifuensis achieved its highest parasitism rate at medium temperatures. The results from this study showed that A. gifuensis performed best at 20 degrees C, suggesting that this parasitoid will be more effective as a biological control agent for M. persicae when the temperature is under 30 degrees C.									5	2	0	0	4	0	6			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000391525700019

Groundwater input may buffer stream water temperature and benefit fish in buffered versus unbuffered streams. Overwinter growth and condition of individual brown trout were measured in 24 groundwater-dominated streams, and the relations between winter growth and condition to stream thermal regime (quantified by regressions of air and water temperature) and diet quality (amount and caloric density of prey) were examined in a subset of 16 streams. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) growth rate (mg.g(-1).day(-1)) was positive overwinter in 18 of 24 streams, and there was no significant change in condition between early and late winter. Juvenile fish grew faster than adults, but there was no significant difference in condition between adults and juveniles. Thermal regime positively influenced winter growth for both adults and juveniles, likely mediated through moderation of water temperature by groundwater, whereas diet had no significant effect on growth.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000392100800007

ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				71	1			35	43		10.1093/icesjms/fst090				JAN 2014	2014	The climate-induced reduction in the mean copepod size, mainly driven by a decrease in the abundance of the large Calanus finmarchicus around 1987, has been linked to the low survival of fish larvae in the North Sea. However, to what extent this sort of reduction in copepod size has any influence on adult particulate feeding fish is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that the availability of the large copepods determines food consumption and growth conditions of lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) in the North Sea. Analysis of stomach content suggested that food consumption is higher for fish feeding on large copepods, and additional calculations revealed how handling time limitation may provide part of the explanation for this relationship. Comparing stomach data and zooplankton samples indicated that lesser sandeel actively target large copepods when these are available. Finally, we observed that the length of lesser sandeel began to decrease in the late 1980s, simultaneously with the C. finmarchicus decline.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000328418500004

Sex-specific temperature dependence of foraging and growth of intertidal snails								MARINE BIOLOGY				161	1			75	87		10.1007/s00227-013-2316-3				JAN 2014	2014	Predicting the biological impacts of climate change requires an understanding of how temperature alters organismal physiology and behavior. Given differences in reproductive physiology between sexes, increases in global temperature may be experienced differently by the males and females of a species. This study tested for sex-specific effects of increased air temperature on foraging, growth, and survival of an intertidal snail, Nucella ostrina (San Juan Island, Washington, 48-30'44aEuro(3)N, 123-08'43aEuro(3)W). Snails exhibited periodic peaks in foraging. Subjecting snails to elevated low tide air temperatures did not alter the timing or magnitude of this pattern. Despite similar temporal patterns in foraging, females foraged more than males, even when the risk of thermal stress was high. While males and females appear to have a similar body temperature threshold for optimal growth, females were more likely to cross that threshold resulting in a loss of body mass when exposed to daily increases in air temperature. These results suggest that the consequences of a warming climate in the short term may be different for males and females of N. ostrina, but also imply longer-term costs of reduced reproductive output, abundance, and distribution of this ubiquitous intertidal predator. Generally, this study points to the possible significance of sex-specific responses in an increasingly warm world.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000329792700007

These changes in the climate, however, do not act alone, and are often accompanied by additional stressors such as eutrophication. Both global warming and eutrophication have been shown to affect the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms. Little is known about the combined effects of rising temperatures and eutrophication on the stoichiometry of entire phytoplankton communities. We exposed a natural phytoplankton spring community to different warming and phosphorus-loading scenarios using a full-factorial design. Our results demonstrate that rising temperatures promote the growth rate of an entire phytoplankton community. Furthermore, both rising temperatures and phosphorus loading stimulated the maximum biomass built up by the phytoplankton community. Rising temperatures led to higher carbon : nutrient stoichiometry of the phytoplankton community under phosphorus-limited conditions. Such a shift towards higher carbon : nutrient ratios, in combination with a higher biomass buildup, suggests a temperature-driven increase in nutrient use efficiency, the phytoplankton community. Importantly, with higher carbon : nutrient stoichiometry, phytoplankton is generally of poorer nutritional value for zooplankton. Thus, although warming may result in higher phytoplankton biomass, this may be accompanied by a stoichiometric mismatch between phytoplankton and their grazers, with possible consequences for the entire aquatic food web.									57	3	0	0	49	1	60			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000337218500008	25039214	
J	Hooff, RC; Bollens, SM								Functional response and potential predatory impact of Tortanus dextrilobatus, a carnivorous copepod recently introduced to the San Francisco Estuary								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				277				167	179		10.3354/meps277167				2004	2004	Despite a dramatic increase in the introduction of non-indigenous estuarine zooplankton in recent decades, the trophic implications of such introductions have rarely been quantified. Here we investigate predation rates of Tortanus dextrilobatus, a carnivorous copepod recently introduced to the San Francisco Estuary that achieves peak abundances in excess of 1000 ind. m(-3). The functional response of T, dextrilobatus feeding upon 2 copepod prey types-the non-indigenous cyclopoid Oithona davisae, and the 'native' calanoid Acartia (Acartiura) sp.-was described by a type II functional response (Ivlev function) at 2 experimental temperatures. In 3 of these 4 treatments, 90 % I-max, was achieved within a naturally occurring range of prey densities. Taxon-specific seasonal size variation was identified, and carbon-based consumption values were used to determine temperature-dependent rates of predation on both prey types. These empirically derived consumption rates and temperature dependence values were then applied to broadscale surveys (1997 to 1999) of zooplankton community composition in order to estimate the predatory impact of T. dextrilobatus upon prey populations in the San Francisco Estuary. Predatory impact estimates (% population consumed d(-1)) greater than 1 % occurred on a regular basis when T. dextrilobatus was abundant, with maxima exceeding 20, 65, and 25% for O. davisae, Acartia (Acartiiura) sp. and all Copepoda, respectively. These observations support the hypothesis that non-indigenous invertebrate zooplanktivores can play a significant role, at least seasonally or episodically, in the secondary production dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.									40	0	0	0	37	0	41			0171-8630			WOS:000224095900013

We investigated how a heat wave influenced growth rate and investment in two immune components (phenoloxidase activity and melanin content) in larvae of two damselfly species, Ischnura elegans and Enallagma cyathigerum. Late instar larvae were kept at 18 degrees C (i.e. their average natural water temperature) or under a simulated long heat wave at 30 degrees C. To explain the heat wave effects, we quantified traits related to energy uptake (food intake and growth efficiency), energy expenditure (metabolic rate measured as activity of the electron transport system, ETS) and investment in energy storage (fat content). The two species differed in life strategy, with I. elegans having a higher growth rate, growth efficiency, ETS activity and fat content. In line with its preference for cooler water bodies, the heat wave was only lethal for E. cyathigerum. However, both species benefited from the heat wave by increasing growth rate, which can be explained by the higher increase in food intake than metabolic rate. This may also have contributed to the increased investment in energy storage and immune components under the heat wave. This mediatory role of food intake indicates the critical role of food availability and behaviour in shaping the impact of heat waves. Our results highlight the importance of including behavioural and physiological variables to unravel and predict the impact of extreme climate events on organisms.									5	1	0	0	3	0	5			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000414145900016	28839009

We tested the separate and interactive effects of water temperature and predation by non-native smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) on the lethal (mortality) and sublethal (behavior, physiology, and growth) effects for juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in seminatural stream channel experiments. Over 48 h trials, there was no difference in direct predation with warmer temperatures, but significant interactive effects on sublethal responses of juvenile salmon. Warmer temperatures resulted in significantly stronger and more variable antipredator responses (surface shoaling and swimming activity), while physiological indicators (plasma glucose, plasma cortisol) suggested suppression of physiological mechanisms in response to the combined stressors. These patterns corresponded with additive negative growth in predation, temperature, and combined treatments. Our results suggest that chronic increases in temperature may not increase direct predation over short periods, but can result in significant sublethal costs with negative implications for long-term development, disease resistance, and subsequent size-selective mortality of Pacific salmon.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000309959900006

The burrowing speed varies from 0.18 to 0.75 cm.s(-1) and an individual covers, in average, between 12.1 and 27.1 cm.d(-1) in the surface sediment layer (depth < 10cm). Daily mean horizontal distance increases as a function to sea water temperature. Daily minimal distance increases while maximal distance decreases when a reduction of sea water temperature is observed. The Nephtys caeca's behaviour in the sediment appears to be different than Nereis virens and probably contributes to maintain of coexistence between these main infaunal predators. Moreover, our results show, for the first time, a predatory behaviour that confirms the carnivorous feeding trends of N. caeca species.									10	0	0	0	6	0	10			0764-4469			WOS:A1996UR34100010		
J	Taylor, DL								Size-dependent predation on post-settlement winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus by sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				263				197	215		10.3354/meps263197				2003	2003	Juvenile flatfish that are large-at-age are assumed to have a survival advantage because of a reduction in predator-induced mortality (bigger-is-better hypothesis), but this generalization is largely unsubstantiated in fisheries research, This study examined size-dependent predation on post-settlement winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus by the sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa, and the interactive effects of flounder density and water temperature on the predator-prey interaction. Shrimp were visually observed foraging on flounder, and the major elements of the 'predation sequence' were quantified, from which the susceptibility and gross vulnerability of flounder were estimated. Flounder susceptibility generally decreased with increasing fish size until a complete refuge from shrimp predation was attained at sizes >25 mm total length (TL). The gross vulnerability of flounder to shrimp predation was dome-shaped when analyzed graphically with respect to prey size. At the extremes of the vulnerability response curve, small flounder (8 to 12 mm TL) benefited from a decreased rate of encounters with shrimp predators, whereas large flounder (18 to 22 mm TL) profited from superior escape abilities and prolonged predator handling time once attacked and captured. Conversely, intermediate-sized flounder (13 to 17 turn TL) suffered the highest rates of mortality, and this was accentuated with increasing temperature and decreasing flounder density. Intermediate-sized flounder (17 mm TL) were the most energetically profitable for shrimp. Below this size, net energy intake of shrimp decreased because of the lower caloric content of smaller flounder. Above this size, the increased metabolic demands associated with foraging on large flounder resulted in a decrease in shrimp net-energy gain. Moreover, shrimp feeding on low densities of flounder suffered a net loss in energy intake, thus possibly explaining the observed density-dependent predation of crangonid species feeding on flatfish. Results from this study challenge the applicability of the bigger-is-better hypothesis to this specific predator-prey interaction.									21	0	0	0	22	0	23			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000187934600018

Constraints on growth during early life stages can have population and community-level implications, yet are rarely addressed by habitat restoration or fishery management efforts. To assess environmental controls on larval growth rates, we sampled adult and young-of-year (YOY) northern pike (Esox lucius) emigrating from spawning grounds in six tributaries of Lake Michigan. We found that YOY growth rates differed significantly among natal streams, in parallel with variation in hatch date and water temperatures. Within each stream, individual growth rates were positively associated with trophic position, as measured by nitrogen isotope enrichment and gut contents. Earlier hatching individuals also grew faster, but the strength of this relationship varied with warming water temperatures (i.e., 21-27 degrees C). Ageing of adult spawners indicated no differences among streams in average growth rates later in life. Our findings suggest that restoration efforts should replicate ecological conditions found in habitats producing large numbers of fast-growing YOY. Key habitat attributes include adequate water level throughout the spring spawning season, and stable, warm water temperature conditions. Providing these environments during early life history could enhance the robustness of northern pike populations by boosting fitness from hatching to emigration to adult habitats.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000461901300011

Strom Thurmond Reservoir, Georgia-South Carolina. Hatching dates were estimated from otolith increments, and availability of prey was estimated from the abundance of zooplankton size-classes commonly eaten by larval threadfin shad. Growth rates of 31 cohorts ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 mm/d, demonstrating the potential for stage-duration effects on cohort survival. Daily growth rate was related to water temperature and prey availability for larvae up to 21 d old. Growth increased linearly with water temperature up to 28 degrees C, but the relation between growth and prey availability was more complex. Growth rate increased with prey density up to 160-290 organisms/L; at higher densities, growth rate decreased or was unchanged. Cohort survival ranged from 0.65 to 0.96 (per millimeter increase in length) and was significantly correlated with water temperature and growth rate but not with prey availability.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000072491100011

Elevated temperatures are predicted to have differential effects on species across trophic levels, due to asymmetric sensitivity to temperature changes. In this study, we examined the direct effects of three temperature regimes (16, 20 and 24 A degrees C) that reflect present and, potentially, future climate conditions on the response of Salix spp. plants, an important bioenergy crop, and its most damaging herbivore (Phratora vulgatissima) and an efficient natural enemy (the omnivorous predator Orthotylus marginalis). We found that plant growth, herbivore oviposition and enemy egg-foraging rate correlated positively with temperature. In the event of elevated temperatures following global climatic changes, these species could potentially respond in tandem. Still, the strength of responses varied among species, with herbivore and natural enemy exhibiting a similar and steeper rate of response relative to plants. Additionally, the herbivore's response was influenced by plant quality with altered oviposition rates depending on whether it was fed the (previously determined) resistant Salix dasyclados or susceptible S. viminalis. This indicates that host plant chemistry has the potential to mediate differential responses to temperature. Together, our results suggest that indirect effects of elevated temperatures, leading to a disruption of trophic associations, may be less likely or less severe in this tri-trophic system.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1872-8855	1872-8847		WOS:000365123900003

Here, we demonstrate that ocean acidification and warming not only directly alter species' (individual) physiological performance, but also their predator-prey dynamics. Our results demonstrate that tissue production (used as a proxy for prey quality) in the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was reduced under scenarios of future climate change, and hence their ability to support energy acquisition for dogwhelk Nucella lapillus through food provision was diminished. However, rather than increasing their feeding rates as a compensatory mechanism, consumption rates of N. lapillus were reduced to the point that they exhibited starvation (a loss of somatic tissue), despite prey resources remaining abundant. The resilience of any marine organism to stressors is fundamentally linked to their ability to obtain and assimilate energy. Therefore, our findings suggest that the cost of living under future climate change may surpass the energy intake from consumption rates, which is likely exacerbated through the bottom-up effects of reduced prey quality. If, as our results suggest, changes in trophic transfer of energy are more common in a warmer, high CO2 world, such alterations to the predator-prey dynamic may have negative consequences for the acquisition of energy in the predator and result in energetic tradeoffs. Given the importance of predator-prey interactions in structuring marine communities, future climate change is likely to have major consequences for community composition and the structure and function of ecosystems.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000395424200009

The Odonata represent a taxon that has many strong links to this abiotic factor due to its tropical evolutionary history and adaptations to temperate climates. Temperature is known to affect odonate physiology including life-history traits such as developmental rate, phenology and seasonal regulation as well as immune function and the production of pigment for thermoregulation. A range of behaviours are likely to be affected which will, in turn, influence other parts of the aquatic ecosystem, primarily through trophic interactions. Temperature may influence changes in geographical distributions, through a shifting of species' fundamental niches, changes in the distribution of suitable habitat and variation in the dispersal ability of species. Finally, such a rapid change in the environment results in a strong selective pressure towards adaptation to cope and the inevitable loss of some populations and, potentially, species. Where data are lacking for odonates, studies on other invertebrate groups will be considered. Finally, directions for research are suggested, particularly laboratory studies that investigate underlying causes of climate-driven macroecological patterns.									99	0	1	0	106	2	114			1388-7890	2159-6719		WOS:000259479200001

During an 8-day mesocosm experiment, we investigated the propagation of light energy up to the copepod trophic level in ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean waters. Using mesocosms with light treatments corresponding to ca. 40% (L1) and 4.5% (L4) of the incident light intensity (simulating light conditions at 10 and 50-60 m depths, respectively), we assessed the feeding behaviour of the dominant copepod Clausocalanus furcatus every second day. We hypothesized that increased availability of copepod food at higher light levels would result in increased copepod ingestion rates and selectivity. Our results showed that copepod prey (microbial biomass >5 mu m) had only a small increase in the L1 and daily rations (DRs) of C. furcatus were similar among treatments (usually <15% of body carbon). Nevertheless, microplankton was clearly selected in L1, having double the contribution in the DR of C. furcatus compared with L4. A more balanced selective feeding pattern was observed in L4, with nanoplankton also being important in the diet. An increase in the copepod stock in the L1 compared with L4, observed at the end of the experiment, is likely associated with the light-mediated effects on C. furcatus feeding behaviour. We suggest that the importance of light availability on the efficiency of the marine planktonic food web should be further considered by climate change predictive models.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000342235000007

Bacterial and ciliate protozoa counts were higher when higher water temperature was recorded. Flagellate counts did not show this pattern, which suggested predation of flagellates by other organisms, or some other different nutritional mode besides phagotrophy. Average individual ciliate predation rates were up to 40-times higher than those of flagellates. These results were compared with similar data obtained from other authors in several aquatic systems. However, the population predation rates of flagellate protozoa were on average 6-times higher than that of ciliate protozoa, due to the low population numbers of the latter. Thus, flagellate protozoa can be considered as more important bacterial consumers than ciliates in this aquatic system.									26	0	0	0	25	0	26			0168-6496			WOS:A1991FK64600007		
J	Preston, Daniel L.; Falke, Landon P.; Henderson, Jeremy S.; Novak, Mark					Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253			Food-web interaction strength distributions are conserved by greater variation between than within predator-prey pairs								ECOLOGY				100	10						10.1002/ecy.2816		JUL 2019		OCT 2019	2019	Species interactions in food webs are usually recognized as dynamic, varying across species, space, and time because of biotic and abiotic drivers. Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator-prey pairs. Predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors were considered as putative drivers of within-pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. Feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. In general, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures, although for nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These results highlight how the ecological scale of inference can strongly shape conclusions about interaction strength consistency and help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000480353400001	31287561

Consumption and gastric evacuation in juvenile red drum Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus): Estimation of prey type effects and validation of field-based daily ration estimates								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				413				21	29		10.1016/j.jembe.2011.11.020				FEB 10 2012	2012	The red drum Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus) is a dominant member of southeastern U.S.A. estuarine systems that feeds on numerous species of commercial and recreational value. Recovering red drum stocks highlight the need for quantification of feeding habits and rates of consumption to assess predatory impact. To validate field-based estimates of gastric evacuation rates and daily ration, a series of controlled laboratory experiments was completed for juvenile and sub-adult red drum (similar to 60-600 g). Influential factors examined included water temperature (17 degrees C and 27 degrees C), prey type (fish and crustacean prey), and red drum body size (small (x) over bar =76.3 g; large (x) over bar =4292 g). Average maximum consumption rate varied between red drum body sizes and water temperatures. Small drum fed at a mean (+/- SD) rate of 18.9 +/- 0.6% body mass d(-1) at 27 degrees C and 9.6 +/- 0.6% body mass d(-1) at 17 degrees C, while large drum fed at a rate of 12.5 +/- 0.8% body mass d(-1) at 27 degrees C and 6.3 +/- 0.4% body mass d(-1) at 17 degrees C. Gross growth efficiency was generally consistent across factors, ranging between 13.2 and 16.3%, with small red drum being slightly more efficient. The rate of gastric emptying was influenced most by temperature and ranged from 4.0 to 9.4%h(-1). The red drum body sizes and prey types we tested demonstrated only modest effects, with slightly faster evacuation rates by smaller red drum and for anchovy prey. Among the eight factor combinations (red drum size x water temperature x prey type) tested during gastric evacuation trials, half (four) of the relationships were best described by the square root model. However, model selection approaches revealed that multiple models provided adequate fit in nearly all cases. Laboratory estimates of red drum gastric evacuation and maximum consumption confirmed that previous field-based estimates were plausible. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In field experiments using tethered juvenile scallops, we examined the effect of biological and physical factors, such as prey size, predator and prey density, water temperature (season) and site, on mortality rates of scallops in Lunenburg Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, The major predators of juvenile scallops were crabs Cancer irroratus and sea stars Asterias spp. In an experiment manipulating scallop density, crab predation rate increased significantly with scallop density, but crab density did not, suggesting a functional response. Sea star predation rate on scallops was not affected by scallop density. In a series of experiments with different size classes of scallops tethered at different sites and seasons, and in different densities of surrounding scallops and predators, the effects of covariates on scallop survival times were assessed using the statistical procedure of survival analysis. Since the tethering technique affected crab and sea star predation differently, the competing causes of scallop mortality were analysed separately. Water temperature, site, and scallop density were the important variables affecting crab predation. There was a significant interaction between temperature and site, such that crab predation on scallops increased with temperature at one site and was independent of temperature at the other site. Predation by crabs also increased with scallop density and, to a lesser extent, with crab density. Water temperature and scallop size were the primary variables affecting sea star predation. Sea star predation on scallops increased with temperature and decreased with scallop size. The results of this study suggest options for minimizing predation of scallops by crabs and sea stars in bottom culture operations.									59	1	0	0	59	0	63			0171-8630			WOS:A1994QA63400004

The local impacts of thermal regime change are challenging to predict because water temperature can influence aquatic organisms and communities at multiple levels simultaneously. For example, thermal change can influence the phenology of periphyton blooms, primary consumer physiology and behaviour, and interspecific interactions with predators. Using tadpoles of the threatened river-breeding foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii, Ranidae), their algal foods and their invertebrate predators, we mimicked dam-induced changes in temperature and observed the outcome of consumer-resource interactions. In stream enclosures, we reared tadpoles across a gradient of cold to warm conditions, quantified the ash content of diet, digestive efficiency and growth rate, and assessed their vulnerability to hemipteran and odonate predators. Tadpoles reared in a cool stream (15.5 degrees C daily mean) digested epilithic periphyton poorly (6.60.4% assimilation efficiency). In contrast, average assimilation efficiency of tadpoles reared at 19 degrees C was 11.60.1%. Access to nutritious diatoms (i.e. dinitrogen-fixing Epithemia spp., Rhopalodiaceae) increased assimilation efficiency to 10.1 +/- 0.1% and 13.8 +/- 0.1% in the cool and warm treatments, respectively. Assimilation efficiency correlated positively with tadpole growth rate (R=0.66, p<.001). The effect of temperature on mortality due to predation was mediated by low tadpole growth rates at cool temperatures and not by the temperature of predator exposure. Non-lethal effects of predators on tadpole growth and tail injury, however, depended on both rearing temperature and exposure temperature. Contrary to the expectation that the cost of predator avoidance behaviours may be greater at warmer exposure temperatures because basal metabolic rates are higher, our results indicated that the energetic cost of foraging less was amplified at cool temperatures. Our results show that when thermal conditions impair digestion in a species' early life stages, recruitment bottlenecks are likely to arise due to the combined negative effects of cool temperatures on assimilation efficiency and growth, and increased predation by invertebrates.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000441693300001		
J	Lemoine, Nathan P.								Predation Risk Reverses the Potential Effects of Warming on Plant-Herbivore Interactions by Altering the Relative Strengths of Trait- and Density-Mediated Interactions								AMERICAN NATURALIST				190	3			337	349		10.1086/692605				SEP 2017	2017	Climate warming will initiate numerous changes in ecological community structure and function, and such high-level impacts derive from temperature-driven changes in individual physiology. Specifically, top-down control of plant biomass is sensitive to rising temperatures, but the direction of change depends on a complex interaction between temperature, predation risk, and predator thermal preference. Here, I developed an individual-based optimal foraging model of three trophic levels (primary producers, herbivores, and predators) to examine how warming affects top-down control of primary producers via both trait-and density-mediated indirect interactions (TMII and DMII). This model also factorially crossed warm-and cold-adapted herbivores and predators to determine how local adaptation modifies the effects of warming on food web interactions. Regardless of predator thermal preference, warming increased herbivore foraging effort and by extension predation rates. As a result, TMII declined in importance at high temperatures regardless of predator thermal adaptation. Finally, predation risk reduced herbivore fitness via both indirect (i.e., reduced herbivore size) and direct (i.e., reduced herbivore survival) pathways. These results suggest that, contrary to previous predictions, warming might stimulate primary productivity by reducing herbivore population sizes, releasing plants from immediate top-down control.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000408203700005	28829642

The relationships between growth rate, survival, and temperature may thus be important for predicting biological responses to climate change. Although it is well known that growth rates and survival are affected by competition and predation in addition to temperature, the combined effect of these factors on growth rates, survival, and size structure has rarely been investigated simultaneously in the same ecological system. To address this question, we conducted experiments on the larvae of two species of damselflies and determined the temperature dependence of growth rate, survival, and cohort size structure under three scenarios of increasing ecological complexity: no competition, intraspecific competition, and interspecific competition. In one species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature became steeper in the presence of competitors, whereas that of survival remained unchanged. In the other species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature was unaffected by competitive interactions, but survival was greatly reduced at high temperatures in the presence of interspecific competitors. The combined effect of competitive interactions and temperature on cohort size structure differed from the effects of these factors in isolation. Together, these findings suggest that it will be challenging to scale up information from single-species laboratory studies to the population and community level.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000336740500028	25000770

Differences in temperature regimes, reproductive timing, activity cost, prey availability, caloric densities of predator and prey, and allometric effects of body size on metabolism are factors that can alter the direct effect of consumption rate on growth rate. We developed a method to elucidate relations between growth and consumption by correcting for allometric weight effects. Bioenergetics model simulations showed that when growth rate is regressed against consumption rate (on either an absolute or a relative basis), the relationship is confounded by the allometric effects of differences in body weight among the populations being compared. Regressing growth rates on the difference between actual and maintenance consumption rate corrects for most of the allometric effects. That regression can be used to determine whether growth rate differences are best explained by consumption (in conjunction with weight allometries), temperature regime differences, variable activity costs, or other factors. Bioenergetics models can be used to evaluate the relative importance of factors limiting growth for fish populations.									37	0	0	0	36	0	37			0002-8487			WOS:A1993MJ44000015

Globally, invasive ascidians have become problematic, ecologically and economically, yet ecological knowledge of velutinids remains limited. This study outlines the life history and feeding ecology of V. velutina in eastern Canada based on laboratory work complemented by field observations. The life history of V. velutina is closely linked with ascidians, which serve as prey and protection for their egg capsules. Egg capsules were embedded within tunics of Aplidium glabrum (Verrill, 1871) and Ascidia callosa Stimpson, 1852, with a preference for the latter. Seasonal behavioural shifts were consistent annually and corresponded with seawater temperature cycles. Feeding dominated during the coldest months (January-May), growth occurred as water temperature increased to the annual maximum (June and July), transitioning to mating during the warmest period (July-August), and egg capsule deposition dominated as water temperature declined (November-January). Larvae hatched between January and July after 2-4 months of development. Velutina velutina preyed on all ascidian species presented during this study, including golden star tunicate, Botryllus schlosseri (Pallas, 1766), and vase tunicate, Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus, 1767), two non-indigenous species, although solitary species were preferred.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000500185000009

Typically, long-term data on free-ranging populations are needed to investigate such phenomena. Here, long-term data on a free-ranging population of western whip snakes (Hierophis viridiflavus: Colubridae) from central Italy were used in order to test the hypothesis that snake feeding frequencies should increase in relation to climate warming, thus positively affecting individual performance because of longer annual activity period, increased daily activity and larger prey base. Data from 231 'female snake-years' of records (including inter-annual recaptures) were collected were collected between 1990 and 2014. The frequency of fed snakes varied remarkably across the study period with a significant increase over the years. There was a significant positive effect of the mean annual temperature on the percentage of fed animals, whereas there was a non-significant relationship between yearly rainfall and percentage of fed animals. There was a positive relationship between mean annual temperature and yearly diversity-of-prey index. No other climatic variables were significantly correlated with yearly diversity-of-prey index. This study supported the hypothesis that global warming may be favorable for thermophilic species (such as H. viridiflavus), as it enhances their foraging performances and hence their feeding frequencies. The same may not be necessarily true for other species which have colder preferenda (e.g., Zamenis longissimus).									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0912-3814	1440-1703		WOS:000367103200004

In addition to direct effects on habitat quality, climate change will foster the expansion of invasive species into new areas and magnify the effects of invasive species already present by altering competitive dominance, increasing predation rates, and enhancing the virulence of diseases, In some cases parapatric species may expand into new habitats and have detrimental effects that are similar to those of invading non-native species. The traditional strategy of isolating imperiled species in reserves may not be adequate if habitat conditions change beyond historic ranges or in ways that favor invasive species. The consequences of climate change will require a more active management paradigm that includes implementing habitat improvements that reduce the effects of climate change and creating migration barriers that prevent an influx of invasive species. Other management actions that should be considered include providing dispersal corridors that allow species to track environmental changes, translocating species to newly suitable habitats where migration is not possible, and developing action plans for the early detection and eradication of new invasive species.									87	0	0	0	83	0	95			0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000256612800010	18577084

Changes in phenology caused by climate change can disrupt species interactions causing decreases in consumer growth rates, as suggested by the match-mismatch hypothesis (MMH). However, it is still not clear what the long-term consequences of such phenological changes are. In this paper, we present models in which phenology and consumer-resource feedbacks determine long-term community dynamics. Our results show that consumer viability is constrained by limits in the amount of phenological mismatch with their resources, in accordance with the MMH, but the effects of phenological shifts are often nonmonotonic. Consumers generally have higher abundances when they recruit some time before or after their resources because this reduces the long-term effects of overexploitation that would otherwise occur under closer synchrony. Changes in the duration of recruitment phenologies also have important impacts on community stability, with shorter phenologies promoting oscillations and cycles. For small community modules, the effects of phenological shifts on populations can be explained, to a great extent, as superpositions of their effects on consumer-resource pairs. We highlight that consumer-resource feedbacks and overexploitation, which are not typically considered in phenological models, are important factors shaping the long-term responses to phenological changes caused by climate change.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1874-1738	1874-1746		WOS:000334577200004		
J	Healey, Michael								The cumulative impacts of climate change on Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and implications for management								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				68	4			718	737		10.1139/F11-010				APR 2011	2011	Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are vulnerable to climate change in both freshwater and marine habitats. I use a qualitative model to assess the cumulative effects of climate change across life stages and generations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and other salmon species. The effects of climate change most relevant to Fraser River sockeye include warming of freshwater and marine habitats, altered hydrology in spawning rivers, reduced productivity in nursery habitats, and changed distribution and phenology of predator and prey species. The weight of evidence indicates that these changes will negatively affect growth and survival of Fraser River sockeye at all life stages. Effects on one life stage will also carry forward to heighten adverse effects at subsequent life stages and across generations so that the cumulative impact is greater than the impact on individual stages. Salmon can adapt to climate change but probably not enough to sustain productivity. In the south, focus of policy and management on conserving and enhancing resilience is needed to retain some salmon production. At the same time, Arctic habitats are becoming accessible to salmon. Management in the Arctic should protect potentially productive habitats from development and facilitate their colonization by Pacific salmon.									31	0	0	0	26	0	31			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000291183500012

These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.									121	0	3	0	112	0	130			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000226791700020

In fishes, growth integrates variation in ecological drivers and provides a signal of changing ecological conditions. Weused a 23-year data set of length-at-age from 353 walleye populations across Wisconsin to test whether walleye growth rates changed over time and what ecological factors best predicted these changes. Using hierarchical models, we tested whether spatiotemporal variation in walleye growth was related to adult walleye density (density-dependent effects), water temperature, and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) catch per unit effort (CPUE; predator or competitor effects). The average length of young walleye increased over time, and as a result, time to reach harvestable size declined significantly. In contrast, average lengths of older walleye have remained relatively constant over time. Juvenile walleye length-at-age was positively correlated with largemouth bass CPUE and surface water temperatures, but negatively correlated with adult walleye density. Our finding of widespread and long-term changes in walleye growth rates provides additional insights into how inland fisheries are responding to environmental change.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000430798800008		
J	Gilioli, G; Baumgartner, J; Vacante, V								Temperature influences on functional response of Coenosia attenuata (Diptera : Muscidae) individuals								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				98	5			1524	1530						OCT 2005	2005	The functional response of single Coenosia attenuta Stein (Diptera: Muscidae) adult females to Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) adults has been investigated at different but constant temperatures and prey densities. The experiments were conducted in cages over a,,vide range of temperatures between 12 and 42 degrees C. At each experimental temperature, the number of attacks increases with increasing prey density up to a maximum attack rate referred to as demand rate. A ratio-dependent and demand-driven functional response model was appropriate to describe the attack rate at different temperatures. Both the demand and the search rate linearly increased with increasing temperatures throughout the range. Based on these results, a temperature- and prey density-dependent bidimensional attack rate model was developed and parameterized. The resulting response surface shows that C. attenuata is active over a wide range of temperatures (from approximate to 12 to 36 degrees C) and attacks occur up to 42 degrees C. Thus, C. attenuata may be a promising biological control agent in Mediterranean greenhouses. To support this conclusion, further studies including the evaluation of spatial scale effects on the search rate and the consideration of the economically relevant whitefly prey are recommended.									21	2	0	0	22	1	25			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000232410700014	16334320

However, the mechanisms that would underlie these predicted responses are not clear. Many studies have focused on proximate mechanisms of physiological processes affecting individual growth. One can also consider ultimate mechanisms involving adaptive explanations by evaluating temperature effects on different vital rates across the life history and using the information in a population dynamical model. Here, we combine long-term data for a top predator in freshwater ecosystems (pike; Esox lucius) with a stochastic integral projection model to analyze concurrent effects of temperature on vital rates, body size, and population dynamics. As predicted, the net effect of warming on population growth rate (fitness) is positive, but the thermal sensitivity of this rate is highly size- and vital rate--dependent. These results are not sensitive to increasing variability in temperature. Somatic growth follows the temperature-size rule, and our results support an adaptive explanation for this response. The stable length structure of the population shifts with warming toward an increased proportion of medium-sized but a reduced proportion of small and large individuals. This study highlights how demographic approaches can help reveal complex underlying mechanisms for population responses to warming.									33	0	0	0	31	0	34			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000330088400009	24464198

The effects of high temperatures on individuals and populations of the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum (Walker)								AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY				21	1			69	78		10.1111/afe.12304				FEB 2019	2019	Green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum is an important defoliating pest of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis that may become more damaging in the future as a result of climate change. Mild winters and higher spring temperatures increase E. abietinum population densities, although this positive response to warmer conditions might be over-ridden if E. abietinum is adversely affected by exceptionally high summer temperatures. In laboratory experiments, aphids exposed to temperatures above 25 degrees C became more restless and were more likely to drop from the shoot, and subsequently showed a reduction in mean relative growth rate. In contrast, survival was not reduced significantly unless temperatures exceeded 35 degrees C. Field data from Radnor Forest in Wales indicated that E. abietinum populations in the autumn were inversely correlated with mean and maximum summer temperatures, at temperatures below those that had a negative impact in the laboratory. The greater sensitivity of populations in the field to high summer temperatures may reflect higher temperatures at the needle surface compared with the temperature of the surrounding air, or associated increases in natural enemy activity. The results from the present study indicate that high temperatures during mid-summer have a significant impact on E. abietinum individuals and populations and, ultimately, may influence how the aphid responds to climate change.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000454811500008

In ectotherms, anthropogenic warming often increases energy requirements for metabolism, which can either impair growth (when resources are limiting) or lead to higher predator feeding rates and possibly stronger top-down trophic interactions. However, the relative importance of these effects in nature remains unclear because: (1) thermal adaptation or acclimation could lower metabolic costs; (2) greater prey production at warmer temperatures could compensate for higher predator feeding rates; and/or (3) temperature effects on trophic interactions via altered biological rates could be small relative to other, temperature-unrelated human impacts on food webs.2. Here, we examined effects of deforestation-associated warming on the minnow Enteromius neumayeri, occurring in both forested (cool) and deforested (warm) streams located inside or nearby an afrotropical rainforest. Combining approaches from physiological and community ecology, we quantified impacts of anthropogenic warming on the metabolism, growth and trophic interactions of this tropical ectotherm. We then compared these effects with impacts of land use unrelated to temperature.3. In a long-term laboratory acclimation experiment quantifying the temperature dependence of growth and metabolism in E. neumayeri, warming increased metabolic rates and decreased growth (at a limited ration). We found no evidence of local (thermal) adaptation, with warming affecting farm and forest populations similarly.4. Then, using mark-recapture methods to quantify impacts of warming on performance in situ, we found similar growth rates in fish from deforested and forested streams despite their distinct thermal environments. This suggests higher prey consumption at deforested sites to compensate for greater metabolic costs, which could strengthen fish-invertebrate interactions.5. Finally, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate fish-invertebrate interaction strength and quantify temperature-related and unrelated impacts of land use on this interaction. We found that although warming increased fish consumption, it apparently increased invertebrate production even more and thus had a net-weakening effect on estimated interaction strength. Most importantly, variation in both fish and invertebrate density not directly related to temperature had a much stronger influence on estimated interaction strength than temperature effects on predator consumption and prey growth.6. We conclude that ectotherms can sometimes offset the metabolic costs of warming with a small increase in consumption that hardly effects food web interactions compared to non-metabolic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances. Future research should assess whether this is a common feature of heavily impacted ecosystems facing multiple stressors.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000431991700019		
J	Barton, Brandon T.								Local adaptation to temperature conserves top-down control in a grassland food web								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				278	1721			3102	3107		10.1098/rspb.2011.0030				OCT 22 2011	2011	A fundamental limitation in many climate change experiments is that tests represent relatively short-term 'shock' experiments and so do not incorporate the phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary change that may occur during the gradual process of climate change. However, capturing this aspect of climate change effects in an experimental design is a difficult challenge that few studies have accomplished. I examined the effect of temperature and predator climate history in food webs composed of herbaceous plants, generalist grasshopper herbivores and spider predators across a natural 4.8 degrees C temperature gradient spanning 500 km in northeastern USA. In these grasslands, the effects of rising temperatures on the plant community are indirect and arise via altered predator-herbivore interactions. Experimental warming had no direct effect on grasshoppers, but reduced predation risk effects by causing spiders from all study sites to seek thermal refuge lower in the plant canopy. However, spider thermal tolerance corresponded to spider origin such that spiders from warmer study sites tolerated higher temperatures than spiders from cooler study sites. As a consequence, the magnitude of the indirect effect of spiders on plants did not differ along the temperature gradient, although a reciprocal transplant experiment revealed significantly different effects of spider origin on the magnitude of top-down control. These results suggest that variation in predator response to warming may maintain species interactions and associated food web processes when faced with long term, chronic climate warming.									43	1	0	0	39	0	44			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000294756400013	21367789

The case of Tetranychus urticae and its predators in citrus								JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE				92	3			1149	1164		10.1007/s10340-019-01114-8				JUN 2019	2019	Climate change can dramatically affect the food web configuration of arthropod communities through its effects on species interactions. We have studied whether these effects could alter the probability of local extinction of three predatory mites naturally associated with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in citrus in Spain and, therefore, disrupt the biological control of this phytophagous mite. Laboratory and semi-field results provide evidence that the natural regulation of T. urticae in citrus can be seriously disrupted in a warmer future. On the one hand, T. urticae populations at conditions representative of future hotter and drier summers, could reach higher population densities than forecasted according to its demographic parameters. On the other hand, T. urticae regulation provided by its predators depended on the environmental conditions, was species-specific, and was affected by interspecific interactions. In some cases, one of the predatory mite species in the system could not be recovered. Because there is evidence that the composition of the community under scrutiny is highly sensitive to local habitat conditions, our results can be taken as evidence that local extinctions may occur more frequently in a warmer future and further contribute to an increasingly higher frequency of T. urticae outbreaks.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000467921900018

In this respect, we performed a laboratory experiment to show the influence of rising temperature on the consumption of Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a serious aphid pest, by three common lady beetle species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We used climate chambers, representing current temperature and two forecasted warming scenarios of 3 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Larval Adalia bipunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and adult A. bipunctata and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) consumed significantly more aphid biomass at rising temperature. Larvae and adults of all species tested consumed significantly more aphid biomass per body weight, and larval body weight gain of all species was significantly higher at rising temperature. The higher consumption of aphid biomass is likely due to a higher demand for energy of adults, and faster growth of larvae.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000467647400008

Modeling population dynamics of scyphozoan jellyfish (Aurelia spp.) in the Gulf of Mexico								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				591				167	183		10.3354/meps12255				MAR 19 2018	2018	To gain understanding and predict how jellyfish populations will respond to anthropogenic changes, we first need to understand the factors that influence the distribution and abundance of current and historical populations. Hence, we have developed the first bioenergetics-based population model for the ubiquitous jellyfish Aurelia spp. that incorporates both benthic and pelagic life history stages. This model tracks cohorts of both life stages with temperature and/or consumption-driven relationships for growth, reproduction and mortality. We present an initial model application to test hypotheses for the environmental factors that control the initiation of strobilation and inter-annual variability in bloom timing and magnitude in Gulf of Mexico jellyfish populations between 1982 and 2007. To recreate the autumnal blooms of Aurelia spp. in the Gulf of Mexico, strobilation must commence while zooplankton biomass is increasing after the annual minimum. Under this scenario, the model simulated seasonal and inter-annual variability of Aurelia spp. biomass that corresponded well with observations. Markedly larger blooms in anomalously warm, high zooplankton years resulted from enhanced ephyrae production compounded by enhanced medusa growth under these conditions. This model confirms the importance of the polyp-to-ephyrae transition in regulating jellyfish bloom magnitude and provides a mechanistic model framework which can examine how future jellyfish populations might respond to climate change.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000428818100014

Future climate change spells catastrophe for Blanchard's cricket frog, Acris blanchardi (Amphibia: Anura: Hylidae)								ACTA HERPETOLOGICA				5	1			119	130						JUN 2010	2010	Climate change may be one of the greatest environmental catastrophes encountered by modern human civilization. The potential influence of this global disaster on wildlife populations is subject to question. I interpolated how seasonal variation in weather patterns influences growth and reproduction in the Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi). Then I extrapolated the influence of future climate conditions on these life history characteristics using fuzzy regression. Fuzzy regression was an accurate predictor of growth and reproduction based on the climate conditions present from 1900-2007. It predicted that the climate projections expected for Arkansas by 2100 could reduce total reproductive investment in the Blanchard's cricket frog by 33-94%. If these results reflect responses by other poikilotherms, climate change could induce major population declines in many species. Because poikilotherms represent the vast majority of vertebrates and significant ecosystem components, it is imperative that we implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and circumvent this possible catastrophe.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1827-9635	1827-9643		WOS:000280140100013

The experiment was conducted using a 4 x 2 factorial design, with four water temperatures (23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees C), two different initial prey concentrations (P-700 and P-1,P-300) and three replicates. Feeding was increased during the fifteen-day experiment. At the end of the experiment, the survival and condition factor were affected only by prey concentrations, with elevated numbers of Artemia nauplii leading to higher averages of these variables. The total length (TL) and specific growth rate were separately influenced by temperature and prey concentration, without interaction between them, and weight showed an interaction with these factors. In general, an increase of temperature (23 to 32 degrees C) improved the growth and nitrogen gain in L alexandri larvae. For TL, the optimal temperatures estimated were 31.4 and 31.0 degrees C for P-700 and P-1,P-300, respectively. Similar mean body weight larvae and nitrogen gain were observed at 23 degrees C for both levels of prey concentrations. For other temperatures, the P-1,P-300 level provided greater weight gain for L. alexandri. Therefore, it is suggested that temperatures between 29-32 degrees C combined with a higher level of prey concentration maximise the development and nitrogen gain in L. alexandri larvae. Moreover, this is the first result about nitrogen incorporation in neotropical fish larvae.									9	0	0	0	8	3	9			1679-6225			WOS:000347909800021

Salinity had no effect on growth or consumption rate in a short-term experiment. In a long-term (90 days) mesocosm experiment, consumption and growth rates declined with increasing body size. Predictive equations developed from short-term experiments did not adequately predict observed consumption rates in the mesocosm experiment. However, growth in the mesocosm experiment was similar to field growth. Also, mesocosm consumption rates and consumption rates calculated using field growth and mesocosm growth efficiencies were similar to published independent field estimates of consumption rate. Our results indicate that experiments to determine the effects of temperature and the allometry of body size on growth and consumption rates should be conducted over long time periods simulating field conditions. Juvenile bluefish have rapid growth and their individual cumulative consumption is large. This result suggests that bluefish may have a large effect on their prey populations. This effect has yet to be quantified. (C) 1995 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.									60	8	0	0	58	0	68			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:A1995TC95600014

However, invader impacts are context-dependent, making reliable and robust predictions challenging. In particular, it is unclear how temporal variabilities in relation to temperature regime shifts influence invader ecological impacts. In the present study, we quantify the functional responses of three coexisting freshwater fishes: the native freshwater River Goby Glossogobius callidus, and the non-native Mozambique Tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus and Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, under two temperature treatments using chironomid larvae as prey. This was used along with fish abundance data to determine temporal differences in ecological impacts of each fish species between seasons (i.e. at two corresponding temperatures). All three fish species exhibited potentially population-destabilizing Type II functional responses. Their maximum feeding rates were consistently higher in the warm temperature treatment, whereas attack rates tended to be reduced. Non-native Mozambique Tilapia had the highest maximum feeding rate under both temperature treatments (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), followed by the non-native Western Mosquitofish and lastly the native River Goby, suggesting greater per capita impacts on native prey by non-native fishes. The predatory fish abundances differed significantly according to season, with native River Goby and non-native Mozambique Tilapia generally more abundant than non-native Western Mosquitofish. By multiplying functional response maximum feeding rates with abundances of each fish species across the seasonal gradient, the relative impact potential of non-native Mozambique Tilapia was consistently higher compared to that of native gobies. Western Mosquitofish impacts were less apparent, owing to their low abundances. We demonstrate how seasonal temperature fluctuations affect the relative impact capacities of introduced species and the utility of consumer functional response and the relative impact potential metric in impact forecasting.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1619-0033	1314-2488		WOS:000478798500001

Spatial and temporal variation in temperature is the generally invoked driver but food abundance and quality are also emphasized. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear and the actual cause is likely to differ both within and among species. Here, we focused our attention on drivers of body size in planktivorous fish that forage through vision. This group of organisms plays a central role in marine ecosystems by linking the energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels. Using a model that incorporates explicit mechanisms for vision-based feeding and physiology, we investigated the influence on optimal body size of several biotic (prey size, prey energy content, and prey biomass concentration) and abiotic (temperature, latitude, and water clarity) factors known to affect foraging rates and bioenergetics. We found prey accessibility to be the most influential factor for body size, determined primarily by prey size but also by water clarity, imposing visual constraints on prey encounters and thereby limiting feeding rates. Hence, for planktivores that forage through vision, an altered composition of the prey field could have important implications for body size and for the energy available for reproduction and other fitness-related tasks. Understanding the complicated effects of climate change on zooplankton communities is thus crucial for predicting impacts on planktivorous fish, as well as consequences for energy flows and body sizes in marine systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000521739200001

In eutrophic Lake Hiidenvesi, we studied the possibility that water quality indirectly affects mysids by forcing them to habitats where they are vulnerable to fish predation. Mysis relicta was absent from basins that did not stratify (water depth < 10 m). In the deep basin, as the summer progressed, M. relicta was concentrated in the deepest areas and moved upward in the water column as water temperature increased and dissolved oxygen decreased. Between mid-August and mid-September, only a thin water layer was habitable; the rest had either intolerably low oxygen concentration or too high of a temperature. M. relicta abundance decreased from 2.72 x 10(8) individuals on 3 June to 3.72 x 10(6) individuals on 19 October, with the sharpest decrease taking place in August. At the same time, the vertical distribution of smelts shifted downward and the percentage of mysids in the stomach contents of smelts increased steeply. The consumption rate by smelts was high enough to explain the collapse of the M. relicta population; during 18 August-2 September, smelts consumed 5.6 times the mysid production. The results suggested that unfavorable physicochemical conditions did not directly cause the drastic reduction of the population abundance of M. relicta but indirectly facilitated predation by smelts, which was the final cause of the collapse. The high predation rate by smelts was probably accelerated by the emergence of chaoborid larvae, which were important food items for smelts in early summer.									28	0	0	0	31	0	33			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000182982300027

Feeding levels were determined for larvae fed live prey (Brachionus plicatilis and Artemia salina) ad libitum. The midgut and total evacuation times were estimated for fish feeding continuously and discontinuously using alternate meals of tagged and untagged live prey. Temperature and fish size had significant effects on gut evacuation and consumption. The gut evacuation time increased with increasing fish size, and decreased with increasing temperatures. Mass-specific midgut contents increased for small larvae < 0.156 mg dry Mass (M-D) (c. 4 mm L-S), and decreased for larger larvae and juveniles. Maximum consumption was modelled by fitting a polynomial function to a reduced dataset of individuals feeding at high levels. The C-MAX model predicted an initial increase in specific feeding rate from 70 to 155% M-D day(-1) for small larvae, before declining for larger larvae and juveniles.

We investigate how global warming potentially alters the strength and spatial extent of these predator-prey interactions in aquatic insect ecosystems. As a simple model system, we use rock pools in streams of rainforests of Hawaii, which contain the beautiful Hawaiian damselfly Megalagrion calliphya as predator and the invasive southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus as prey. This abundant mosquito is the major vector of avian malaria transmission to native forest birds. We use mathematical modeling to evaluate the potential impacts of damselfly predation and temperature on mosquito population dynamics. We model this predator-prey system along an elevational gradient (749-1952 m elevation) and assess the effect of 1A degrees C and 2A degrees C climate warming scenarios as well as the effects of El Nio and La Nia oscillations, on predator-prey dynamics. Our results indicate that the strength of biotic resistance of native predators on invasive prey may decrease with increasing temperature because demographic rates of predator and prey are differentially affected by temperature. Future warming could therefore increase the abundance of invasive species by releasing them from predation pressure. If the invasive species is a disease vector, these shifts could increase the impact of disease on both humans and wildlife.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			1874-1738	1874-1746		WOS:000314026500003

OECOLOGIA				151	1			115	124		10.1007/s00442-006-0544-7				FEB 2007	2007	Climate models predict an increasing frequency of extremely hot summer events in the northern hemisphere for the near future. We hypothesised that microbial grazing by the metazoan macrofauna is an interaction that becomes unbalanced at high temperatures due to the different development of the grazing rates of the metazoans and the growth rates of the microbial community with increasing temperature. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed grazing experiments in which we measured the impact of increasing temperatures on the development of the grazing rates of riverine mussels in relation to the growth rates of a unicellular prey community (a natural heterotrophic flagellate community from a large river). In a first experimental series using Corbicula fluminea as a grazer and under the addition of a carbon source (yeast extract), the increase of the prey's growth rates was considerably stronger than that of the predator's grazing rates when temperatures were increased from 19 to over 25 degrees C. This was also the outcome when the mussels had been acclimatized to warm temperatures. Hereafter, specific experiments with natural river water at temperatures of 25 and 30 degrees C were performed. Again, a strong decrease of the mussels' grazing rates in relation to the flagellate growth rates with increasing temperature occurred for two mussel species (C. fluminea and Dreissena polymorpha). When performing the same experiment using a benthic microbial predator community (biofilms dominated by ciliates) instead of the benthic mussels, an increase of the grazing rates relative to the growth rates with temperature could be observed. Our data suggest that predator-prey interactions (between metazoans and microbes) that are balanced at moderate temperatures could become unbalanced at high temperatures. This could have significant effects on the structure and function of microbial communities in light of the predicted increasing frequency of summer heat waves.									24	0	0	0	20	0	26			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000243325800011	16964501

Temperature, plankton and conspecific density influence dynamics of age-0 gizzard shad: implications for a gape-limited piscivore								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				23	3			322	335		10.1111/eff.12083				JUL 2014	2014	Age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum are the main prey fish for white crappies Pomoxis annularis in many US reservoirs. However, these prey fish commonly outgrow their vulnerability to white crappie predation in some, but not all, northern Missouri reservoirs. Potential variables that could influence abundance, growth and mortality of age-0 gizzard shad were examined in three reservoirs that differed with respect to age-0 gizzard shad growth rates. Because of thermal effluent from a power plant, gizzard shad spawned earlier in Thomas Hill Lake and initial densities of larvae were greater than in the other reservoirs. Larval and juvenile gizzard shad grew slowest in Thomas Hill Lake, followed by Mark Twain Lake and Long Branch Lake. Growth rate of larvae increased with increasing water temperature and food abundance, but decreased with increasing conspecific density. Similar relationships were found for juvenile growth, except that growth declined with increasing temperature. The slower growth of larvae and juveniles in Thomas Hill Lake was probably a consequence of their greater densities relative to their food abundance and higher water temperatures during the juvenile stage. Conversely, both larvae and juvenile gizzard shad grew more rapidly and juveniles attained large sizes in Long Branch Lake owing to their lower densities relative to their available food. Mortality of larvae and juveniles was mostly similar among the reservoirs. Because of their greater abundance and slower growth, gizzard shad were available as prey for white crappies for a longer period in Thomas Hill Lake than in the other reservoirs.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000337683700004

Although the direct effects of environmental conditions are relatively well studied, the effects of environmentally mediated species interactions have garnered less attention. In this study, we examined the temperature dependency of size-structured intraguild predation (IGP) between native blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus, the IG predator) and invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas, the IG prey) to evaluate how the effect of temperature on competitive and predatory rates may influence the latitudinal distribution of these species. In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we quantified interactions between blue crabs, green crabs, and shared prey (mussels) at three temperatures reflective of those across their range, using two size classes of blue crab. At low temperatures, green crabs had a competitive advantage and IGP by blue crabs on green crabs was low. At high temperatures, size-matched blue and green crabs were competitively similar, large blue crabs had a competitive advantage, and IGP on green crabs was high. We then used parameter values generated from these experiments (temperature- and size-dependent attack rates and handling times) in a size-structured IGP model in which we varied IGP attack rate, maturation rate of the blue crab from the non-predatory to predatory size class, and resource carrying capacity at each of the three temperatures. In the model, green crabs were likely to competitively exclude blue crabs at low temperature, whereas blue crabs were likely to competitively and consumptively exclude green crabs at higher temperatures, particularly when resource productivities and rates of IGP were high. While many factors may play a role in delimiting species ranges, our results suggest that temperature-dependent interactions can influence local coexistence and are worth considering when developing mechanistic species distribution models and evaluating responses to environmental change.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000428878200013	29352463

BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix, collectively 'bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference, warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML. Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have grown an additional 8-40% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity, thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000546200800002

In summer 2015, the Pacific Northwest experienced a drought with early onset of stream low flows, reduced summer discharge, and elevated temperatures. We evaluated population responses of two dominant stream predatorscoastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) and coastal giant salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus)across nine Cascade Mountain streams. Drought conditions impacted both trout and salamanders, but their responses differed. Adult trout abundance and biomass were significantly lower in 2015 relative to 2014, a year with discharge and temperature closer to historical norms. Juvenile trout abundance did not differ between years but juveniles were significantly larger in 2015. Salamander abundance and biomass were not significantly different between years but body condition was lower in all nine streams in 2015. Differences in temperature among streams did not explain trout or salamander responses. Habitat was important for trout responses with trout abundance and biomassexperiencing smaller declines in systems with more deep pool area. Despite notable short-term drought impacts to trout and salamanders in 2015, populations recovered to pre-drought conditions within twoyears in all but the smallest stream.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000460694400005

This study investigated the behavioral performance of Habrobracon hebetor Say on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller larvae treated with Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Soroldn sensu lato (s.l.) (isolate M14) at two different temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). A type II functional response was observed in female wasps of all treatments. Estimated handling time and attack rate values were not statistically different at two thermal conditions. Female wasps avoided the odor of fungus infected host larvae when offered simultaneously with healthy ones at 30 degrees C revealed by olfactory choice test. The number of untreated larvae parasitized by H. hebetor females was significantly differed between temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). Overall, this study suggests that application of M. anisopliae s.l. for biological control of E. kuehniella is compatible with concurrent use of H. hebetor at 30 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The choice of optimal temperature area of a juvenile (1-group) cod growing from a start weight (50 g, 15 cm) to a size refuge (640 g, 40 cm) was modelled for two scenarios with distributions of predators (4+ groups cod) similar to those observed in the Barents Sea in February 1990 and 1994, respectively, and without food limitations, The model predicted that when there was an overlap in distribution between large cod and younger cud (0-3 group), the younger year classes would move to areas with lower temperature and less predators. offering higher survival rates. Fish predators forced the prey to inhabit less optimal areas, and both growth and survival rates fell in comparison a with a scenario with fewer fish predators (cannibals) and less overlap. Increased fish predator density increased these effects. and the juveniles would stay in colder water for a longer period and their growth rate would be further reduced. Higher mortality, independent of area and size, made it more profitable to stay in warmer water. leading to higher growth but increased mortality rates.

As tracers, the number of vertebrae, and of dorsal and anal fin rays were used, since the variability in these characteristics reflects the phenotypic plasticity induced by differences in environmental conditions, and especially water temperature, during early pelagic life. From the onset of larval immigration in March 1995, the juvenile O-group plaice population was sampled frequently and the variability in its meristic characteristics was analysed. The number of vertebrae appeared to be established by water temperature conditions during the egg stage, while the number of dorsal and anal fin rays seemed to be determined during the larval stage. As a consequence, the number of vertebrae was not correlated with either the number of dorsal fin rays or the number of anal fin rays, but the numbers of anal fin rays and dorsal fin rays were strongly correlated. Strong support was found for Kinne's (1962; Comp Biochem Physiol 5:265-282) 'irreversible non-genetic adaptation' hypothesis-that the variability induced by environmental conditions during early life still expresses itself later on in juvenile life-as there was a significant positive relationship in our study between growth and the number of vertebrae during the period April to July. Also, instantaneous mortality was positively related to the number of vertebrae. It is suggested that the relationship with mortality results from a correlation between vertebral number and some important characteristic involved in avoiding predators, such as locomotory performance. Also, mean growth rate during the growing season and instantaneous mortality rate were positively correlated for each meristic characteristic. It is argued that the relationship between growth and mortality will vary over the years and will depend on the combination of environmental conditions during egg and larval stage compared to those during the subsequent juvenile stage.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000087620800021

Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we addressed how 4 degrees C warming and exposure to the pesticide endosulfan shape the predation on Culex pipiens mosquitoes by damselfly predators from replicated low-and high-latitude populations. Although warming was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates on these prey. Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes. Our results suggest that predation rates on mosquitoes at the high latitude will be reduced under warming unless predators evolve toward the current low-latitude phenotype or low-latitude predators move poleward.									16	1	0	0	15	0	16			1752-4571			WOS:000379931900007	27330557

We also observed the activity levels of age 1 crabs under light and dark conditions, and predator avoidance behavior by the age 0 crabs. Age 1 crabs (15-20 mm in carapace length (CL)) were active 24 h/day, but motion was about 33% higher in light than in dark conditions, and increased in direct proportion with water temperature (2-10 degrees C). Feeding rate was also directly related with temperature for age 1 crabs, which consumed 7% of body weight per day at 2 degrees C, and 20% at 10 degrees C. Both temperature and habitat complexity had significant effects on survival of age 0 RKC (CW, 2.2-2.6 mm) when exposed to age 1 crabs (CL, 17-19 mm), with no significant interaction. Survival diminished 31% in a linear relationship from 2-10 degrees C, and was twice as high in a complex structural environment compared with bare sand habitat. Predator avoidance behavior by age 0 RKC improved from juvenile molt stage 2 to stage 4. Increasing water temperature may serve to increase mortality by cannibalism in RKC, both in aquaculture and in the field, but survival will increase substantially in structurally complex environments.									33	0	0	0	31	0	33			0730-8000			WOS:000285670100027

However, the strength of NCEs should depend on the physiological and environmental contexts in which prey must choose between food and safety. For ectotherms, temperature effects on metabolism and foraging rates may shape these choices, thereby altering NCE strength. We examined NCEs in a rocky intertidal food chain across a latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient within the Gulf of Maine. The NCEs of green crabs (Carcinus maenas) on the foraging, growth, and growth efficiency of prey snails (Nucella lapillus) were consistent across a broad (similar to 8.5 A degrees C) temperature range, even though snails that were transplanted south consumed twice as many mussels (Mytilus edulis) and grew twice as much as snails that were transplanted north. The positive effects of warmer temperatures in the south allowed snails under high risk to perform similarly to or better than snails under low risk at cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that for prey populations residing at temperatures below their thermal optimum, the positive effects of future warming may offset the negative effects of predation risk. Such effects may be favorable to prey populations facing increased predation rates due to warmer temperatures associated with climate change. Attention to the direct and indirect effects of temperature on species interactions should improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on ecological communities.									23	0	0	0	21	0	23			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000350033500014	25433694

Population abundance has declined during the last 30 years because of decreased marine growth rate, survival-rate, and production of multi-sea-winter fish. Mortality appears density-independent, indicating that the marine abundance is beneath the carrying capacity for the species. Correlations between the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index for the post-smolt year and production variables indicate that unfavourable climatic conditions are partly responsible for the decline. Low sea temperature may be the ultimate reason for the poor salmon production, whereas predation is one proximate mortality factor, which is probably both size and temperature dependent. Low growth rate during cold years was associated with low sea age at maturity and small salmon, contrary to the common observation that fast growth leads to young age at maturity. It is suggested that low water temperature may stimulate lipid storage relative to protein production and that the energy density needed to attain sexual maturity is lower in small than in large salmon. Future research should focus on the relationships between smolt age and (or) size and adult age and (or) size, and the association among water temperature, growth rate, growth efficiency, and age at sexual maturity.

Final weights (W-f) and specific (SGR) and relative (RGR) growth rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at 28 and 31 degrees C (W-f = 10.5-12.4 g, SGR = 1.95-2.07%/d, RGR = 246-273%) than at 22 or 25 degrees C (W-f = 7.33-8.70 g, SGR = 1.32-1.52%/d, RGR = 131-164%). Temperature unit requirements per gram of growth (range = 342-234 degrees C x d/g) also appeared to decrease with temperature within this range. Higher growth with increasing temperature was related to feed consumption (% body weight/d), which increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 1.60 at 22 degrees C to 2.23 at 31 degrees C. Feed conversion ratio (weight fed/weight gained; range = 1.23-1.04) and condition factor (10(3) x weight/length(3); range = 30.6-31.7) did not differ among treatments. Survival did not differ and remained high (range = 96.4-100%) under all treatments. The results demonstrate that sea temperature within an ecological range has pronounced and direct effects on feeding and growth of juvenile Nassau grouper. Based on in situ sea temperature data in a known juvenile habitat, we hypothesize that timing of spawning in relation to seasonally changing sea temperatures in these habitats may be important in determining juvenile growth rates, vulnerability to predation, and hence, year-class strength. A temperature range of 28-31 degrees C is recommended for culture of early juveniles, although higher temperatures may be feasible.									12	1	0	0	11	1	14			0002-8487			WOS:A1997WW21700012

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on the walnut aphids Chromaphis juglandicola Kalt. and Panaphis juglandis (Goeze)								EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL				30	1					137	10.1186/s41938-020-00337-7				DEC 17 2020	2020	Background The walnut aphid species Chromaphis juglandicola Kalt. and Panaphis juglandis (Goeze) are destructive insect pests. Harmonia axyridis (Pall.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is the main predatory insect with a wide geographical distribution. The feeding behavior of the predator against the two different aphid species might influence bio-control efficacy in walnut orchards. Main body Functional response of H. axyridis to various densities of the two aphid species was examined under temperatures ranging from 15 to 30 degrees C. The results showed that functional responses of H. axyridis towards C. juglandicola or P. juglandis fitted well with the Holling-II equation within the range of 15-30 degrees C. A greater biomass of aphids was consumed when the temperature increased from 15 to 30 degrees C. The predation efficacy of H. axyridis against C. juglandicola was greater than against P. juglandis, and the searching efficiency of H. axyridis against C. juglandicola was more effective than against P. juglandis. Moreover, predation rates against both aphid species decreased with increasing the H. axyridis density. Conclusion This study showed that H. axyridis was an effective predator against the two walnut aphids. Increasing temperature (15-30 degrees C) increased prey consumption. Interference between individuals from increasing predator density had a negative impact on predation rate against the two aphid species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1110-1768	2536-9342		WOS:000590269900001

While much is known about the direct effect that temperature can have on aquatic communities, less is known about its indirect effect via the temperature dependence of viscosity and temperature-dependent trophic interactions.2. We manipulated the temperature (5-20 degrees C) and the viscosity (equivalent to 5-20 degrees C) of water in laboratory-based bacteria-protist communities. Communities contained food chains with one, two or three trophic levels. Responses measured were population dynamics (consumer carrying capacity and growth rate, average species population density, and the coefficient of variation of population density through time) and ecosystem function (decomposition).3. Temperature, viscosity and food chain length produced significant responses in population dynamics. Temperature-dependent viscosity had a significant effect on the carrying capacity and growth rates of consumers, as well as the average density of the top predator. Overall, indirect effects of temperature via changes in viscosity were subtle in comparison to the indirect effect of temperature via trophic interactions.4. Our results highlight the importance of direct and indirect effects of temperature, mediated through trophic interactions and physical changes in the environment, both for population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Future mechanistic modelling of effects of environmental change on species will benefit from distinguishing the different mechanisms of the overall effect of temperature.									21	0	0	0	18	0	21			0021-8790			WOS:000283074000019	20722873

Crucially, the tri-trophic responses of plants, herbivores and their natural enemies to warming are poorly understood. To delineate these interactive properties, a three-system approach and integrating life table methodology were used to examine the responses of wheat plants, English grain aphid and parasitoids under open-field infrared heating to simulate warming.RESULTSWarming significantly increased wheat biomass and grain weight, causing a phenological shift in plant growth. Importantly, warming significantly increased the number of aphids and the reproductive period, coupled with a higher net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate. Otherwise, duration of development, generation span, and population doubling time all decreased significantly. Warming had no effect on parasitoid abundance but resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of parasitism.CONCLUSIONWarming may strengthen bottom-up effects on aphids by increasing wheat biomass, resulting in reduced regulation of aphid populations. Warming had a different effect on parasitoids between 2015 and 2016. These findings provide an important characterization of ecological mechanisms in plant-herbivore-parasitoid systems and give a theoretical foundation for improved forecasting of aphid population dynamics under climate change.

J	WHITE, EG; SEDCOLE, JR								A 20-YEAR RECORD OF ALPINE GRASSHOPPER ABUNDANCE, WITH INTERPRETATIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				15	2			139	152						1991	1991	A 20-year capture-recapture study of alpine grasshoppers spanned three distinct sequences of abundance, featuring in turn dis-equilibrium, equilibrium and secondary cyclic equilibrium. This succession of population patterns in the most abundant species, Paprides nitidus, retained high stability between generations. It arose via superimposed life-cycle pathways and adaptive responses between grasshopper phenologies and their environmental constraints. The responses were identified by correlation coefficient analysis across extensive matrices (11 500+ correlations) of environmental records x time-lagged grasshopper estimators. An estimator of resident population members performed better than total population estimators. The observed retention of population stability despite shifts in the patterns of abundance implies some predictability, and potential effects of climate change (increased temperature, rainfall and raindays) are examined in a context of global warming. It is concluded that flora and fauna could eventually become depleted in alpine regions due to the displacement of grasshopper populations to vegetation-scree margins where physical weathering and vegetation instability are often pronounced.The highly flexible P. nitidus life cycle emphasises a high level of variation in egg phenology, whereby alternative overwintering pathways (quiescence, diapause, extended diapause) lead to variable life-cycle durations. The schematic cycle accommodates two quite different species, Sigaus australis and Brachaspis nivalis, and is throughout the cycle, and the 20-year census history suggests that a classic predator-prey response may arise between a native skink species (Reptilia) and grasshoppers.									6	1	0	0	6	0	8			0110-6465			WOS:A1991HA88800006

However, latitudinal gradients in plant quality as food for herbivores suggest lower palatability at higher temperatures, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. If plant palatability would decline with temperature rise, then this may question the expectation that warming leads to enhanced top-down control. Therefore, experiments that directly test plant palatability and the traits underlying palatability along a temperature gradient are needed. Here we experimentally tested the impact of temperature on aquatic plant growth, plant chemical traits (including stoichiometry) and plant palatability. We cultured three aquatic plant species at three temperatures (15, 20, and 25 degrees C), measured growth parameters, determined chemical traits and performed feeding trial assays using the generalist consumer Lymnaea stagnalis (pond snail). We found that rising temperature significantly increased the growth of all three aquatic plants. Plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content significantly decreased, and carbon (C):N and C:P stoichiometry increased as temperature increased, for both Potamogeton lucens and Vallisneria spiralis, but not for Elodea nuttallii. By performing the palatability test, we found that rising temperatures significantly decreased plant palatability in P lucens, which could be explained by changes in the underlying chemical plant traits. In contrast, the palatability of E nuttallii and V spiralis was not affected by temperature. Overall. P lucens and V spiralis were always more palatable than E. nuttallii. We conclude that warming generally stimulates aquatic plant growth, whereas the effects on chemical plant traits and plant palatability are species-specific. These results suggest that the outcome of the impact of temperature rise on macrophyte stoichiometry and palatability from single-species studies may not be broadly applicable. In contrast, the plant species tested consistently differed in palatability, regardless of temperature, suggesting that palatability may be more strongly linked to species identity than to intraspecific variation in plant stoichiometry.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			1664-462X			WOS:000455108900001	30671079	
J	Nuernberger, Fabian; Haertel, Stephan; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf								Seasonal timing in honey bee colonies: phenology shifts affect honey stores and varroa infestation levels								OECOLOGIA				189	4			1121	1131		10.1007/s00442-019-04377-1				APR 2019	2019	Increasingly frequent warm periods during winter, which are associated with climate change, may cause mismatches between the colony phenology of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera L., and their floral resources. Warmer winter periods can also affect colony brood rearing activity and consequently the reproduction of the invasive brood parasite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman. Until now little is known about the effects of climate change on biotic interactions in such a multitrophic system comprising flowering plants, a pollinator, and its parasite. We performed a reciprocal translocation experiment with honey bee colonies to simulate climate change-induced phenology shifts. Honey bee brood phenology was highly sensitive to environmental conditions in late winter. Colonies in which phenology was experimentally delayed had smaller worker populations in early spring and reduced amounts of stored honey during the following months. During summer, the varroa load in colonies with non-shifted phenology was three times higher than in colonies with delayed phenology. High varroa loads during summer were negatively correlated with worker population growth. Despite a remarkable resilience of colony development to phenology shifts, our results show that mismatches between the phenology of honey bee colonies and flowering plants can affect the build-up of resource stores. Further, an advanced onset of brood rearing activity after hibernation can reinforce the negative impact of the brood parasite V. destructor. We conclude that trade-offs between synchronisation with earlier flower phenology and prolonged brood phases with build-up of varroa populations might constrain the honey bees' capability to adapt to climate warming.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000466216700024	30879141

Land-use and climate change could alter the distribution of both native and exotic mosquitoes by changing abiotic and biotic characteristics of freshwater habitats. We initially studied the influence of land use on standing water habitats, and the subsequent effects on native and exotic mosquito and mosquito-predator presence.2. Associated with abiotic habitat characteristics, mosquito-predator richness was highest in aquatic habitats of natural land uses (forest and grassland), and lowest in human-modified land uses (pastoral and urban), and the opposite relationship was true for mosquito presence.3. Based on the outcome of the field survey we investigated the potential effects of climate-induced habitat warming and drying on interactions between invasive Aedes notoscriptus and native Culex pervigilans mosquitoes and native invertebrate predators affected by the land-use gradient.4. Predator presence, which is directly affected by both climate and land-use change, influenced both mosquito survivorship and behaviour. We found predation rates increased with temperature, but the magnitude of changes depended on both predator and prey identity. In general, higher temperatures increased mosquito pupation rates, but also made mosquitoes more susceptible to predation. Although invasive A. notoscriptus were more susceptible to predation, increased temperature resulted in shorter life cycles, thereby reducing the net effect of increased predation caused by higher temperatures.5. Overall, our results suggest interactions between temperature, land use and predator identity will be important in determining mosquito distributions, and will likely differ between mosquito species. Such interactions and species-specific responses will be particularly important if environmental changes facilitate range expansion of invasive mosquito species that are vectors for disease.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000409110900006

We argue that many ecologically damaging invaders are characterised by their more efficient use of resources. Consequently, comparison of the classical 'functional response' (relationship between resource use and availability) between invasive and trophically analogous native species may allow prediction of invader ecological impact. We review the utility of species trait comparisons and the history and context of the use of functional responses in invasion ecology, then present our framework for the use of comparative functional responses. We show that functional response analyses, by describing the resource use of species over a range of resource availabilities, avoids many pitfalls of 'snapshot' assessments of resource use. Our framework demonstrates how comparisons of invader and native functional responses, within and between Type II and III functional responses, allow testing of the likely population-level outcomes of invasions for affected species. Furthermore, we describe how recent studies support the predictive capacity of this method; for example, the invasive 'bloody red shrimp' Hemimysis anomala shows higher Type II functional responses than native mysids and this corroborates, and could have predicted, actual invader impacts in the field. The comparative functional response method can also be used to examine differences in the impact of two or more invaders, two or more populations of the same invader, and the abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. parasitism) context-dependencies of invader impacts. Our framework may also address the previous lack of rigour in testing major hypotheses in invasion ecology, such as the 'enemy release' and 'biotic resistance' hypotheses, as our approach explicitly considers demographic consequences for impacted resources, such as native and invasive prey species. We also identify potential challenges in the application of comparative functional responses in invasion ecology. These include incorporation of numerical responses, multiple predator effects and trait-mediated indirect interactions, replacement versus non-replacement study designs and the inclusion of functional responses in risk assessment frameworks. In future, the generation of sufficient case studies for a meta-analysis could test the overall hypothesis that comparative functional responses can indeed predict invasive species impacts.									152	1	0	0	142	0	153			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000333011700001

Amphibious fishes have a variety of strategies, both physiological and/or behavioural, to cope with a broad range of thermal conditions. This study examined the relationship between prolonged (5 weeks) exposure to a range of temperatures (22, 25, 28, or 32 degrees C) on oxygen uptake rate and movement behaviours (i.e., thermoregulation and emergence) in a common amphibious fish, the barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilneatuis). At the highest temperature examined (32 degrees C, approximately 5 degrees C above their summer average temperatures), barred mudskippers exhibited 33.7-97.7% greater oxygen uptake rates at rest ((M) over dotO(2Rest)), emerged at a higher temperature (CTe; i.e., a modified critical thermal maxima (CTMax) methodology) of 41.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C relative to those maintained at 28, 25, or 22 degrees C. The 32 degrees C-maintained fish also ceased movement activity at the highest holding temperature suggesting that prolonged submergence at elevated temperatures is physiologically and energetically stressful to the individual. Using exhaustive exercise protocols with and without air exposure to simulate a predatory chase, the time to recovery was examined for all individuals. When submerged, mudskippers required 2.5x longer recovery time to return to resting oxygen uptake from exhaustive exercise than those fully emerged in air. Oxygen uptake data revealed that air exposure did not accrue oxygen debt, thereby allowing faster return to resting oxygen consumption rates. If the option to emerge was not available, mudskippers preferentially sought more benign water temperatures (26.7 +/- 2.1 degrees C), resembling those experienced by these fish during the Austral autumn, regardless of prolonged exposure higher or lower temperatures. These results add to our understanding of the strategies that amphibious fishes may use to mitigate extra costs associated with living in warm waters, and could be the key to understanding how such species will cope with increasing temperatures in the future.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0306-4565			WOS:000454467700009	30509669	
J	Franze, Gayantonia; Menden-Deuer, Susanne								Common temperature - growth dependency and acclimation response in three herbivorous protists								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				634				1	13		10.3354/meps13200				JAN 23 2020	2020	Phytoplankton growth dependence on temperature is recognized and has been quantified comprehensively. However, no similar relationship exists for the major phytoplankton predators, the herbivorous protists, especially at low temperatures representing polar and coastal oceans during most seasons. Their acclimation to changing temperatures is also largely unexplored. Here we report acclimated growth and acclimation rates from 0 to 22 degrees C for 3 cosmopolitan herbivorous dinoflagellates. Due to interactive effects between size and temperature, growth increased 40% more rapidly with increasing temperature for production- compared to division-based growth rates (0.043 and 0.062 d(-1) degrees C-1, respectively). Biomass-based growth rates were 10-fold higher than abundance-based rates at low temperatures, reflecting an average 50% increase in biovolume at <= 2 degrees C. Thus, there was significant biomass accumulation at low temperatures, despite low cell-division rates. Testing different acclimation procedures, we established that acclimated rates emerged after 3 generations. Herbivores required 1.25 d degrees C-1 when acclimating towards higher temperatures and 2.5 d degrees C-1 when transitioning towards lower temperatures. Growth rates increased linearly with temperature, implying a weaker temperature effect on growth than the commonly assumed exponential dependency. A possible consequence is that herbivore growth rates are underestimated at cold and overestimated at warm temperatures. Current and future ocean assessments could thus underestimate trophic transfer rates in polar and cold-water regions and overestimate herbivore growth and thus grazing impact in future ocean predictions. Identifying physiological responses that transcend species-specificity supports cross-biome comparisons of ecosystem structure and function that rely on accurate predictions of matter and energy flow in planktonic food webs.[GRAPHICS]									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000521191400001

These priority effects are likely to be affected by climate warming and the rate of intraspecific predation, that is cannibalism. In a laboratory experiment, we examined size-mediated priority effects in larvae of the univoltine damselfly, Lestes sponsa, at two different temperatures (21 and 23 degrees C). We created three size groups of larvae by manipulating hatching time: early hatched with a large size (extra-advanced), intermediate hatched with an intermediate size (advanced) and late hatched with a small size (non-advanced). Thereafter, we reared the larvae from these groups in non-mixed and mixed groups of 12 larvae. We found strong priority and temperature effects. First, extra-advanced larvae most often had higher survival, growth and development rates than non-advanced larvae in mixed groups, compared to groups that consisted of only extra-advanced larvae. Second, temperature increased growth and development rates and cannibalism. However, the strength of priority effects did not differ between the two experimental temperatures, because there was no statistical interaction between temperature and treatments. That is, the mixed and non-mixed groups of non-advanced, advanced and extra-advanced larvae showed the same relative change in life-history traits across the two temperatures. Non-advanced and advanced larvae had similar or higher growth rate and mass in mixed groups compared to non-mixed groups, suggesting that predation from advanced larvae in the mixed group released resources for the non-advanced and advanced larvae that survived despite cannibalism risk. Thus, a thinning effect occurred due to cannibalism caused by priority effects. The results suggest that a shift in the relative arrival of offspring can cause temperature-dependent priority effects, mediated through cannibalism, growth and development, which may change the size distribution and abundance of emerging aquatic insects.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000467994800013	30659605	
B	Okei, N						Howell, BR; Moksness, E; Svasand, T		Predation by octopus on released abalone								STOCK ENHANCEMENT AND SEA RANCHING								468	477						1999	1999	Marking and recapture experiments were carried out on the coast of Hegurajima using Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Ino) produced in the hatchery in 1992 and 1993. The survival rate usually decreased rapidly to below 10% after a month. The numbers of empty shells and of individuals unaccounted for increased with time after release. Almost all the surviving individuals were detected within 5m of the release points: therefore the increase of individuals unaccounted for was thought to be mainly caused by the dispersion of empty shells. Boreholes presumed to be from the octopus Octopus vulgaris Cuvier were observed in 20.7 to 33.8% of the empty shells.Laboratory experiments to estimate the predation by octopus on Ezo abalone confirmed that abalone was a very attractive prey of octupos. The predatory activity of octopus almost disappeared below 12 degrees C and increased with water temperature from 12 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The proportion of shells bored was similar to the proportion of bored shells in the empty shells collected in the field investigation. These results suggest that the reduction of the stocking effect of released Ezo abalone was caused by octopus predation.					1st International Symposium on Stock Enhancement and Sea Ranching1st International Symposium on Stock Enhancement and Sea Ranching	SEP 08-11, 1997SEP 08-11, 1997	Norwegian Program Utvikling Stimulering HavbeiteNorwegian Program Utvikling Stimulering Havbeite	BERGEN, NORWAYBERGEN, NORWAY	2	0	0	0	2	0	2					0-85238-246-4	WOS:000086510500033

We also performed a complementary predation experiment to separate the effects of predation from climate-driven changes. We show that recruitment from the sediment is crucial for shaping the rotifer community and that an elevated temperature will likely advance the recruitment peak resulting in an earlier rotifer peak abundance in spring. However, increased predator abundances, also resulting from elevated temperatures, counteracted the climate driven increase in rotifer recruitment and thereby hampered the pelagic establishment of rotifers. We show further that different rotifer genera respond differently to these increased predation pressure due to selective predation by copepods and taxa-specific protection morphologies and behaviors of rotifers. However, with the exception of one taxon, the effects from brownification were negligible, compared to effects imposed by elevated temperatures. We conclude, therefore, that future rotifer dynamics will be affected both directly through elevated temperatures and indirectly by increased predation.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000362227500008

A challenge for ecotoxicologists is to predict how joint effects of climatic stress and toxicants measured at the individual level (e.g., reduced survival and reproduction) will be manifested at the population level (e.g., population growth rate, extinction risk) and community level (e.g., species richness, food-web structure). The authors discuss how population- and community-level responses to toxicants under GCC are likely to be influenced by various ecological mechanisms. Stress due to GCC may reduce the potential for resistance to and recovery from toxicant exposure. Long-term toxicant exposure can result in acquired tolerance to this stressor at the population or community level, but an associated cost of tolerance may be the reduced potential for tolerance to subsequent climatic stress (or vice versa). Moreover, GCC can induce large-scale shifts in community composition, which may affect the vulnerability of communities to other stressors. Ecological modeling based on species traits (representing life-history traits, population vulnerability, sensitivity to toxicants, and sensitivity to climate change) can be a promising approach for predicting combined impacts of GCC and toxicants on populations and communities.

By extension, it also affects those ecological interactions that are mediated by gland-produced chemical compounds, such as reservoir-based chemical defense. Herein, we investigate how environmental temperature affects the regeneration of defensive secretions and influences the efficacy of chemical defense in a model predator-prey system: the oribatid miteArchegozetes longisetosusand the predaceous rove beetleStenus juno. Through a combination of chemical analyses, non-linear regression modeling and theoretical simulations we show that the amount of defensive secretion responded to temperature in a unimodal optimum curve: the regeneration rate followed a positive, linear relationship up to 35 degrees C, but rapidly broke down beyond this temperature ("tipping point" effect). Using functional response simulations, there is an initially positive dampening effect on the predation rate when regeneration is optimal, but at higher temperatures chemical defense does not counteract the previously described effects of elevated predatory pressure. In a larger context, our results demonstrate the need to integrate relevant environmental factors in predator-prey modeling approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0098-0331	1573-1561		WOS:000565093500002	32875537

The MG/OFC hypothesis assumes optimal food conditions (i.e. no competition for superfluous food and hence no negative density-dependent growth) and consequently a maximum growth rate only determined by prevailing water temperature conditions. Growth of 0-group plaice subpopulations was determined for a number of areas differing in food abundance and composition (benthic biomass of potential food items) and density of 0-group plaice in both the intertidal and the sublittoral. Growth showed a positive relationship with food abundance, in both the intertidal and the sublittoral, falsifying the MG/OFC hypothesis. At similar food abundance, growth in the intertidal was always higher than in the sublittoral due to the presence of the lugworm Arenicola marina in the intertidal only. In the intertidal, growth was positively related to density of A. marina. The assumption of the MG/OFC hypothesis of no negative density-dependent growth was confirmed both in the intertidal and in the sublittoral, although it did not result in maximum growth rate for 0-group plaice everywhere in the field. Differences in growth rate therefore do not necessarily reflect competition for food and density-dependent growth, but they might reflect differences in food composition and availability (searching and handling time).									105	0	0	0	103	1	105			0171-8630			WOS:A1993ME43700008

We need tools to predict which species are most vulnerable to these threats. Pairwise species associations and body size are simple but promising predictors of the relative impact of species introduced outside of their historical ranges. We examined the vulnerability of 30 fish species to the impacts of three centrarchid predators that are being introduced to lakes north of their historical range boundaries. Species that were negatively associated with each centrarchid in their historical range were more likely to be lost from lakes with centrarchid introductions. Total body length was most important in predicting impact for the most gape-limited predator. At the regional scale, our method identifies those species most vulnerable to introductions facilitated by climate change and can easily be applied to a range of taxa undergoing range expansions.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000362305500024	26180073

The effects of some environmental factors on the size-dependent predation were also investigated. The results indicate that the predation rate increased with larval development, until the larvae had developed the ability to actively avoid predation at approximately 11-day post-hatching and decreased thereafter. This suggests a size-dependent predation on the fish larvae. Water temperature and predator size significantly affected the predation rate of the medusae on the fish larvae, but the temperature and size effects were markedly reduced as the larvae reached post-larval stage. These findings suggest that water temperature and jellyfish size interacted with the ontogenetic development of the fish larvae to affect the predation rates. The presence of alternative prey Artemia salina, could alleviate the predation rate on the fish larvae, whereas light conditions showed no effects on the predation rate. Due to their overlaps in spatial and temporal distributions along the north Chinese coast, jellyfish are likely to prey upon flounder larvae and thus affect the recruitment of the wild fish populations.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000355625400011

Experiment I was conducted in water which fluctuated between 15 and 20 degrees C. Experiment II and III were conducted in a laboratory and water temperature was maintained between 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. Three common trends were noted for all three experiments: (1) feeding rate of C. carpio was lower than that of C. pellegrini, and this difference was found to be significant in experiment I; (2) growth rate of C. carpio was higher than C. pellegrini, and the difference was found to be significant in experiment II; (3) food conversion efficiency and energy retention efficiency for C. carpio were higher than those of C. pellegrini, and significant differences were noted in experiment I and II. Since the growth period for fish in the Xingyun Lake generally occurs when water temperatures are between 15 and 25 degrees C, it can be suggested that C. carpio has advantages over C. pellegrini in growth and food utilization efficiency, and lower food consumption than C. pellegrini. These physiological traits of C. carpio might allow this species to be more resistant to food shortage and predation, and may be partially responsible for the displacement of C. pellegrini by C. carpio.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1909			WOS:000253525100013

To investigate the effects of major environmental parameters on P. shiwhaense, growth and ingestion rates of one strain of P. shiwhaense on the algal prey species Amphidinium carterae (also a dinoflagellate) were determined under various light intensities (0-500 mu E m(-2) s(-1)), water temperatures (5-30 degrees C), and salinities (5-40). Cells of P. shiwhaense did not grow well in darkness but grew well at light intensities >= 10 mu E m(-2) s(-1). There were no significant differences in either growth or ingestion rates of P. shiwhaense fed A. carterae at light intensities between 10 and 500 mu E m(-2)s(-1). Furthermore, P. shiwhaense did not grow at 5 degrees C or >= 28 degrees C. Its growth rates between 7 and 26 degrees C were significantly affected by temperature, and the optimal temperature for maximal growth was 25 degrees C. With increasing salinity from 5 to 20, the growth rate of P. shiwhaense fed A. carterae increased and became saturated at salinities between 20 and 40, while the ingestion rate at salinities between 10 and 40 did not significantly change. Thus, overall, the growth and ingestion rates of P. shiwhaense fed A. carterae were affected by temperature and salinity, but not by light intensity other than darkness. These findings provide a beginning basis for understanding the ecology of this potentially harmful algal species in marine coastal ecosystems.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1568-9883	1878-1470		WOS:000453621000004	30502811

Demographic effects of warming, however, are determined by the expression of these physiological effects through predator-prey and other species interactions. Using field observations and controlled experiments, we measured how increasing temperatures in the Arctic affected development rates and mortality rates (from predation) of immature Arctic mosquitoes in western Greenland. We then developed and parametrized a demographic model to evaluate how temperature affects survival of mosquitoes from the immature to the adult stage. Our studies showed that warming increased development rate of immature mosquitoes (Q(10) = 2.8) but also increased daily mortality from increased predation rates by a dytiscid beetle (Q(10) = 1.2-1.5). Despite increased daily mortality, the model indicated that faster development and fewer days exposed to predators resulted in an increased probability of mosquito survival to the adult stage. Warming also advanced mosquito phenology, bringing mosquitoes into phenological synchrony with caribou. Increases in biting pests will have negative consequences for caribou and their role as a subsistence resource for local communities. Generalizable frameworks that account for multiple effects of temperature are needed to understand how climate change impacts coupled human-natural systems.									27	0	0	0	23	0	27			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000363357100006	26378217

This results in the exclusion of other, mostly native gammaridean species and a change in benthic communities. The present study analysed the influence of environmental factors (water temperature) and morphological factors (sex, body parts involved in catching and holding prey) on the predatory behaviour of Dikerogammarus villosus. A diet study of invasive relatives of D. villosus showed that predation intensity is especially high in spring and summer, that is, at increasing and high temperatures. Experiments with D. villosus in climate rooms at various temperatures, using the native Gammarus fossarum as prey, showed that the average predation rate by both sexes gradually increased over the temperature range from 5 to 30A degrees C. Natural mortality during the experiments was negligible compared to losses due to predation. At each temperature, the predation rate by females was lower than that by males. Males showed a steep allometric growth of body parts involved in the process of catching and holding prey, compared to females at increasing body size in a number of measurements. This may explain the difference in predatory behaviour between males and females, which plays a role in intraguild predation a supposed mechanism for species displacement.					15th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)15th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)	SEP 23-27, 2007SEP 23-27, 2007		Nijmegen, NETHERLANDSNijmegen, NETHERLANDS	11	1	0	0	11	0	11			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000270646300005

Predator weight did not explain a significant independent proportion of variation in C(max). The mean maximum daily ration, determined from replicate ad libitum feeding on juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), was 0.47, 0.70, 3.39, and 4.50 cg.g-1 at 8.0, 12.5, 17.0, and 21.5-degrees-C, respectively. The corresponding mean daily number eaten was 0.50, 1.17, 4.25, and 7.01 prey per predator at the four increasing temperatures. To quantify the temperature-dependent consumption relation, replicate C(max) data within the preferred temperature range were fitted to exponential and exponential sigmoid models. On the basis of a knowledge of thermal relations of northern squawfish, we combined hypothetical C(max) data at temperature extremes with our mean experimental results to fit an algorithm suitable for use in simulation modeling. Both the generalized gamma and biological-rate (Thornton and Lessem. 1978. Trans. Am. Fish. Soc. 107: 284-287) algorithms were suitable to describe a hypothetical temperature-C(max) model over the entire environmental temperature range of 0-27-degrees-C observed in the Columbia River.									20	1	0	0	22	0	23			0706-652X			WOS:A1991GY57800021

A question of major concern is whether coral reefs can adapt to and survive the predicted increases in global temperatures over the remainder of this century.A simple model of a coral reef ecosystem is developed to include adaptation of key growth and mortality parameters for a coral polyp population and its symbiotic algae population. Interacting populations of pelagic phytoplankton and zooplankton are also simulated.The model simulates a stable coral reef ecosystem in the absence of climate change, but predicts the extinction of the coral population under global warming if the populations do not adapt. However, when the coral and symbiont populations adapt to climate change, a stable coral reef ecosystem is predicted. The model allows identification of processes and parameters to inform attempts to measure the key attributes of adapting coral reef ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000529795300003

We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter-spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%-285% across time, while two larger spring-summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1-1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2-4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (T-max) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with T-max were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes.									13	1	0	0	13	1	13			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000414969000044	28712135

Fish were reared singly in aquaria ;It six different constant temperatures (5, 9, 13, 16, 18 and 20 degrees C). They were fed Neomysis integer or commercial pelleted food for 2 weeks and growth and food consumption were measured. In both experiments, growth rate increased to an optimum at 15 degrees C. Growth rates were high in the range 13-18 degrees C, with no significant (P>0.05) differences between temperatures. No significant (P>0.05) differences in growth were found between fish at 9 and 20 degrees C. There were no effects of diet on size-adjusted growth rates. The growth efficiency decreased with increasing temperature in both treatments. but the decrease was faster in the Neomysis treatment. Charr seemed to compensate for the high water content (79.5%) of Neomysis by having a higher food intake.

Using 24 predictor indices, we compared competing hypotheses and calculated average models for the distributions of capelin, age-0 Pacific cod, and age-0 pollock in the eastern Bering Sea from 2006 to 2010. Distribution was described using a two stage modeling approach: probability of occurrence ("presence") and density when fish were present. Both local (varying by location and year) and annual (uniform in space but varying by year) indices were evaluated, the latter accounting for the possibility that distributions were random but that overall presence or densities changed with annual conditions. One regional index, distance to the location of pre flexion larvae earlier in the year, was evaluated for age-0 pollock. Capelin distributions were best predicted by local indices such as bottom depth, temperature, and salinity. Annual climate (May sea surface temperature (SST), sea ice extent anomaly) and wind (June wind speed cubed) indices were often important for age-0 Pacific cod in addition to local indices (temperature and depth). Surface, midwater, and water column age-0 pollock distributions were best described by a combination of local (depth, temperature, salinity, zooplankton) and annual (May SST, sea ice anomaly, June wind speed cubed) indices. Our results corroborated some of those in previous distribution studies, but suggested that presence and density may also be influenced by other factors. Even though there were common environmental factors that influenced all species' distributions, it is not possible to generalize conditions for forage fish as a group.

In the Tasmanian southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery (SRLF), predation by octopus is known to vary spatially, assumed to be in response to different environmental and ecological conditions. However, these effects are not well understood and there is concern that changes in the system, as a result of climate change, may alter the spatial distribution and extent of octopus predation. Using fishery-dependent commercial time series data (2000-2011), we first examined how in-pot lobster mortality by octopus predation varied across fishing areas at inter- and intra-annual scales. These spatial and temporal patterns were examined using dynamic regression models (DRM) using lagged variables of lobster abundance (lobster catch per unit effort, CPUE), fishing effort (potlifts) and environmental variables (sea surface temperature, SST). This demonstrated that in-pot mortality in most areas was strongly affected by the current lobster CPUE (indicating an instantaneous direct impact), whereas fishing effort and SST differed spatially in terms of lag selection and correlation sign. Most eastern Tasmanian areas showed a stronger effect of fishing effort rather than SST, with the opposite pattern along the west coast. We provide the first classification of SRLF stock assessment areas based on predation risk level and identify the explanatory fishing and environmental factors.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000373919200002

Coccinella septempunctata larvae developed more rapidly and consumed fewer total aphids as temperature increased, although when the number of aphids consumed per day were examined, only those larvae reared at 15-degrees-C consumed significantly less aphids than at any other regime. All other regimes were not significantly different. The developmental threshold and degree-days over the threshold needed for complete development were estimated at 11.7-degrees-C and 275 days, respectively. Hippodamia convergens did not develop to the adult stage at 15-degrees-C, although complete development was observed at the other four temperature regimes. At the temperature regimes where development was observed, H. convergens, in general, also took fewer days to develop and consumed fewer total aphids as temperature increased. On an aphids per day basis, H. convergens consumption was not significantly different in the temperature range of 20-30-degrees-C. The developmental threshold and degree-days to complete development for H. convergens were estimated as 6.7-degrees-C and 351 degree-days, respectively.									16	0	0	0	12	0	16			0147-1724			WOS:A1991FK93500010

Rapid population growth of this invasive predator threatens native fish communities. A bioenergetics model was developed for lionfish (i.e., both species) and then applied to estimate the potential impact of these predators on a reef fish community. We conducted a series of laboratory trials to evaluate consumption and respiration rates between 14 degrees C and 32 degrees C for lionfish weighing from 20 to 400g. Water temperature greatly influenced consumption; mean daily consumption rates increased from 14 degrees C to 29.7 degrees C and declined at 32.5 degrees C. Energy density of the prey was the most sensitive parameter in the model and estimates of food consumption corresponded with empirical and laboratory estimates. To realize population-level impacts, we applied the bioenergetics model to a size-structured virtual population of 393 lionfish/ha on a reef in the Bahamas. Model simulations estimated that this population would annually consume 929kg of prey/ha when feeding at 60% of maximum consumption. This model provides the first comprehensive assessment of lionfish bioenergetics accounting for the effects of size and temperature on prey consumption and improves the capacity to evaluate the trophic impacts of lionfish in the Atlantic Ocean.									22	0	0	0	22	0	22			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000327469700004

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				64	5			768	776		10.1139/F07-052				MAY 2007	2007	The out-of-phase population oscillations between anchovy and sardine have been attributed to climate changes. However, the biological processes causing these species alternations have remained unresolved. Here we propose a simple "optimal growth temperature" hypothesis, in which anchovy and sardine regime shifts are caused by differential optimal temperatures for growth rates during the early life stages. Dome-shaped relationships between growth rate and sea temperature were detected for both Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) larvae based on otolith microstructure analysis. The optimal growth rate for anchovy larvae occurred at 22.0 degrees C, whereas that for sardine larvae occurred at 16.2 degrees C. Ambient temperatures have historically fluctuated between these optima, which could lead to contrasting fluctuations in larval growth rates between the two species. This simple mechanism could potentially cause the shifts between the warm anchovy regime and the cool sardine regime in the western North Pacific. Although retrospective analysis suggested synergistic effects of other factors (e.g., trophic interactions and fishing), the optimal growth temperature concept would provide a possible biological mechanism of anchovy and sardine regime shifts.									152	1	0	0	118	1	161			0706-652X			WOS:000248338800002

Predators drive community reorganization during experimental range shifts								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				89	10			2378	2388		10.1111/1365-2656.13289		JUL 2020		OCT 2020	2020	Increased global temperatures caused by climate change are causing species to shift their ranges and colonize new sites, creating novel assemblages that have historically not interacted. Species interactions play a central role in the response of ecosystems to climate change, but the role of trophic interactions in facilitating or preventing range expansions is largely unknown. The goal of our study was to understand how predators influence the ability of range-shifting prey to successfully establish in newly available habitat following climate warming. We hypothesized that fish predation facilitates the establishment of colonizing zooplankton populations, because fish preferentially consume larger species that would otherwise competitively exclude smaller-bodied colonists. We conducted a mesocosm experiment with zooplankton communities and their fish predators from lakes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, USA. We tested the effect of fish predation on the establishment and persistence of a zooplankton community when introduced in the presence of higher- and lower-elevation communities at two experimental temperatures in field mesocosms. We found that predators reduce the abundance of larger-bodied residents from the alpine and facilitate the establishment of new lower-elevation species. In addition, fish predation and warming independently reduced the average body size of zooplankton by up to 30%. This reduction in body size offset the direct effect of warming-induced increases in population growth rates, leading to no net change in zooplankton biomass or trophic cascade strength. We found support for a shift to smaller species with climate change through two mechanisms: (a) the direct effects of warming on developmental rates and (b) size-selective predation that altered the identity of species' that could colonize new higher elevation habitat. Our results suggest that predators can amplify the rate of range shifts by consuming larger-bodied residents and facilitating the establishment of new species. However, the effects of climate warming were dampened by reducing the average body size of community members, leading to no net change in ecosystem function, despite higher growth rates. This work suggests that trophic interactions play a role in the reorganization of regional communities under climate warming.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000550503500001	32592594

To improve the management of mussel seedbeds, knowledge is required on over winter predation, a factor affecting mussel survival. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of A. rubens feeding activity during winter and how it relates with changes in temperature. Feeding activity of starfish was monitored during a full winter. The potential impact of temperature change on starfish-mussel seed interactions during winter was analysed. The factor shading was included, as changes in light intensity appear to be a primary governing factor for the timing of feeding activity. The results showed that temperature limits feeding rate and feeding activity of starfish during winter. However, starfish feeding rate exhibited very high sensitivity to temperature changes. Light intensity affected both feeding rate and feeding activity. It is concluded that starfish may not be an important factor destabilising seedbeds during a mean winter, but its importance may grow along with the increasing temperature due to climate change.

Here, we examined how one of Japan's endemic crustaceans, Daphnia tanakai, which has been found only in alpine lakes and pools in high mountain moors, is adapted to the alpine environment and what restricts its distribution only to the alpine environment. Lab experiments on UVB tolerance and growth rate under different pH and temperature based on the field survey for pools in mountain moors revealed that D. tanakai was differentiated from two low-altitude species (Daphnia dentifera and Daphnia pulicaria) by its tolerance to low pH such as 4.5, which is equal to the mean pH of pools in the high mountain moors occupied by D. tanakai. The growth rate at pH 4.5 was, however, significantly lower than that at higher pH, suggesting that low pH was not necessarily an optimal condition, and that other factors restrict the distribution to alpine lakes. Vulnerability to invertebrate predators such as Chaoborus was suggested as such a factor by additional experiments on swimming activity and predation and the fact that D. tanakai has only been found in pools without Chaoborus. Because it is known that the pH of alpine lakes is tightly linked with temperature, global warming may diminish the advantage of D. tanakai and allow invasion of alpine lakes by unwelcome predators and competitors from lower altitudes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000393804600013

The success of the herbivorous juvenile stage of the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), Acanthaster planci, may be affected by the impacts of ocean conditions on its crustose coralline algal (CCA) food. To partition the direct effects of near future ocean acidification on juvenile COTS and indirect effects through changes in their CCA food, COTS were grown in three pHT levels (7.9, 7.8, 7.6) and fed CCA grown at similar pH levels. Consumption of CCA by COTS was bolstered when the COTS were grown in low pH and when they were fed CCA grown in low pH regardless of the pH in which the COTS were reared. COTS fed CCA grown at pH 7.6 grew fastest, but the pH/pCO(2) that the COTS were reared in had no direct effect on growth. Ocean acidification conditions decreased the C : N ratio and carbonate levels in the CCA. Bolstered growth in COTS may be driven by enhanced palatability, increased nutritive state and reduced defences of their CCA food. These results indicate that near future acidification will increase the success of early juvenile COTS and boost recruitment into the coral-eating life stage.									14	0	0	0	12	0	14			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000405955300021	28592677

We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and estimated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years with many cohorts of large individuals resulted in biomass well above the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.									29	0	0	0	23	0	30			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000256228300018

While the ecological impact that grazing predators can have in terrestrial and temperate marine systems are well established, the importance of coral grazers on tropical reefs has rarely been considered. In this study, we estimate the biomass of coral tissue consumed by four prominent species of corallivorous butterflyfishes. Sub-adult butterflyfishes (60-70 mm, 6-11 g) remove between 0.6 and 0.9 g of live coral tissue per day, while larger adults (> 110 mm, similar to 40-50 g) remove between 1.5 and 3 g of coral tissue each day. These individual consumption rates correspond to the population of coral-feeding butterflyfishes at three exposed reef crest habitats at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, consuming between 14.6 g (+/- 2.0) and 19.6 g (+/- 3.9) .200 m(-2) day(-1) of coral tissue. When standardised to the biomass of butterflyfishes present, a combined reefwide removal rate of 4.2 g (+/- 1.2) of coral tissue is consumed per 200 m(-2) kg(-1) of coral-feeding butterflyfishes. The quantity of coral tissue removed by these predators is considerably larger than previously expected and indicates that coral grazers are likely to play an important role in the transfer of energy fixed by corals to higher consumers. Chronic coral consumption by butterflyfishes is expected to exact a large energetic cost upon prey corals and contribute to an increased rate of coral loss on reefs already threatened by anthropogenic pressure and ongoing climate change.									32	0	0	0	30	0	32			0722-4028			WOS:000286940800010

Despite their importance within the food-web, no method currently exists to estimate daily consumption for Great Lakes slimy (Cottus cognatus) and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii). We conducted experiments to estimate gastric evacuation (GEVAC) and collected field data from Lake Michigan to estimate index of fullness [(g prey/g fish weight)100%) to determine daily ration for water temperatures ranging 2-5 degrees C, coinciding with the winter and early spring season. Exponential GEVAC rates equaled 0.0115/h for slimy sculpin and 0.0147/h for deepwater sculpin, and did not vary between 2.7 degrees C and 5.1 degrees C for either species or between prey types (Mysis relicta and fish eggs) for slimy sculpin. Index of fullness varied with fish size, and averaged 1.93% and 1.85% for slimy and deepwater sculpins, respectively. Maximum index of fullness was generally higher (except for the smallest sizes) for both species in 2009-2010 than in 1976 despite reductions in a primary prey, Diporeia spp. Predictive daily ration equations were derived as a function of fish dry weight. Estimates of daily consumption ranged from 0.2 to 0.8% of their body weight, which was within the low range of estimates from other species at comparably low water temperatures. These results provide a tool to estimate the consumptive demand of sculpins which will improve our understanding of benthic offshore food webs and aid in management and restoration of these native species in the Great Lakes.

Back-calculated standard lengths (SL) at age differed between year classes in most cases. Annual SL increments were related to temperature and age using a non-linear growth model. Growth declined with increasing age, whereas annual SL increments increased with increasing water temperature. The best-fit model was with the total number of summer days when air temperature exceeded 20 degrees C (using water temperature equivalents of air temperature). A growth model including water temperature, age, year class, relative condition and rainfall was a better fit than other models. Year-class strength was positively correlated with water degree-days, and year-class strength negatively affected annual SL increments. The results indicate that within a strong year class of crucian carp, the growth of individual fish is reduced compared with weak year classes, suggesting that density negatively affects growth in ponds where resources are limited.									6	0	0	0	6	0	7			0969-997X	1365-2400		WOS:000295098100003

Trophic ecology and assessment of the predatory impact of the Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita (Linnaeus, 1758) on zooplankton in the Black Sea								CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE				61	1			33	46		10.21411/CBM.A.96DD01AA				2020	2020	Experiments on the feeding of the Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita have shown that digestion time of zooplankton typically varies between 2.2 and 5.1 h depending on the body weight of the predator, diet composition, amount of food, and seawater temperature. The daily ration of a Moon jellyfish with a wet body mass of 1 g reached 0.025-2.845 mg zooplankton.ind(-1).day(-1) corresponding to a carbon-specific food uptake of 0.2-9.1% C day(-1) with a mean value around 0.5% C day(-1). Such mesozooplankton consumption rates are consistent with the ration values (around 0.9% C day(-1)) calculated from the feeding rate experiments of jellyfish at natural food concentrations. However, in both cases the amount of mesozooplankton was insufficient to compensate for the minimum food requirements, calculated from oxygen consumption (6.7 +/- 0.6% C day(-1)) of the jellyfish. On average, the metabolic expenses of A. aurita were about one order of magnitude greater than its ration supplied by mesozooplankton, indicating the important role of visually overlooked food components in the jellyfish diet.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0007-9723	2262-3094		WOS:000545764200004

Annual means of spring phytoplankton biomass correlated to phosphorus input from land and shifts between diatoms and dinoflagellates were attributed to potential Si limitation and time of sampling relative to the spring phytoplankton succession. The summer phytoplankton biomass, which more than doubled over the study period, was related to the abundance of summer copepods that similarly declined. Cyanobacterial blooms proliferated in summer and the proportion of diatoms similarly declined when the winter-spring inorganic N/P ratio was low. The chlorophyte proportion in summer increased over the study period, and this was linked to increasing temperatures favoring their higher growth rates. The dinoflagellate proportion appeared to decrease with temperatures above a threshold of 15.5 degrees C. Although nutrient inputs and their ratios are important factors for the phytoplankton community, this study suggests that climate change and overfishing could be equally important.									24	0	0	0	19	0	26			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000300084700011

Several exceptions to this expectation have been identified, however, and it is vital that we understand the underlying mechanisms if we are to improve our ability to predict future trends. Here, we used a natural warming experiment in Iceland and quantitative theoretical predictions to investigate the success of brown trout as top predators across a stream temperature gradient (4-25 degrees C). Brown trout are at the northern limit of their geographic distribution in this system, with ambient stream temperatures below their optimum for maximal growth, and above it in the warmest streams. A five-month mark-recapture study revealed that population abundance, biomass, growth rate, and production of trout all increased with stream temperature. We identified two mechanisms that contributed to these responses: (1) trout became more selective in their diet as stream temperature increased, feeding higher in the food web and increasing in trophic position; and (2) trophic transfer through the food web was more efficient in the warmer streams. We found little evidence to support a third potential mechanism: that external subsidies would play a more important role in the diet of trout with increasing stream temperature. Resource availability was also amplified through the trophic levels with warming, as predicted by metabolic theory in nutrient-replete systems. These results highlight circumstances in which top predators can thrive in warmer environments and contribute to our knowledge of warming impacts on natural communities and ecosystem functioning.									35	1	0	0	26	0	35			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000381077300021	26936833

Salmo salar parr tested in the presence of overhead cover were significantly more nocturnal and occupied more peripheral positions than those tested in the absence of overhead cover. This increase in nocturnal activity was driven primarily by increased activity at night, accompanied by a reduction in daytime activity during winter. The presence of overhead cover had no effect on rates of food intake or growth for a given food supply in a given season. Growth rates were significantly higher for fish subjected to a high food supply than those subjected to a low food supply. Food supply did not affect the extent to which S. salar parr were nocturnal. These results were consistent between winter and summer. The use of riparian shading as a management technique to mitigate the effects of warming allows the adoption of more risk-averse foraging behaviour and may be particularly beneficial in circumstances where it serves also to increase the availability of food.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000284321600007	21078093

To predict food-web-mediated effects of climate warming, we relied on phase-specific warming trends (during winter, early thermal stratification, summer stagnation) of an 11-year (19992009) period to study instantaneous or time-delayed ecological responses. 2.Warming during the period of early thermal stratification (here corresponding to May) rather than during winter or summer was found to generate complex, time-delayed cascading effects on Daphnia via timing and rates of predation. In contrast to our hypothesis, warming exceeding a critical mean temperature (14 degrees C) during May increased the stability of the Daphnia population during summer. 3.The termination of predation on Daphnia by older perch and L.kindtii was advanced even stronger (14days per degree Celsius warming during May) than the start of predation. Warming during May thus shortened the period of synchronised predation on Daphnia by older perch, young-of-the-year perch and L.kindtii (match index) by up to 4weeks, thereby decreasing total rates of predation on Daphnia during July by up to 40%. 4.The timing of the top-down control of Leptodora dynamics by perch proved to be a key process for population stability of Daphnia during summer compared to the less important direct cascading effect of fish on Daphnia and temperature effects on Leptodora growth and consumption or on Daphnia reproduction. 5.We conclude that predicting the consequences of climate warming for plankton dynamics requires a mechanistic understanding of lake-specific temperature-driven changes in trophic cascades, especially when an invertebrate predator is dynamically coupled both to the key herbivore and to their predators.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000314805800011

We quantified factors affecting age-0 paddlefish abundance, hatch time, growth, and survival in an unimpounded reach of the Mississippi River during 2000-2008. We trawled several habitats, collecting 2,074 age-0 paddlefish from 10 to 170 mm total length. Paddlefish hatch timing varied across years (30-60 d), generally commencing in the middle of April and ending in June when a threshold water temperature was reached and river stage variability increased. Correspondingly, an analysis of covariance revealed a strong interaction between year and habitat for catch per unit effort in the small (10-50 mm) (P = 0.025) and medium (51-100 mm) (P = 0.040) size-classes, indicating that habitat preferences were likely influenced by year. However, no relations between these variables in the large size-class (>100 mm) existed (P = 0.88). Age-0 paddlefish growth rates differed among years (i.e., 1.87-3.31 mm/d) and were positively related to water temperature (r = 0.64; P = 0.083). Mortality rates varied by year (range = -0.26 to -0.57) and were positively correlated with the number of days water temperature was below 28 degrees C during April 15 through July 15 (r = 0.67, P = 0.070). Water temperature and river stage variability may regulate early-life dynamics of paddlefish. Early-life history dynamics are likely interrelated with habitat conditions present in the river. The highest catch rates of young paddlefish were on the main channel side and side channel of islands, suggesting that these habitats are important to paddlefish. Within these habitats, paddlefish frequently occupied moderate velocities (i.e., 0.4-0.6 m/s), moderate depths (i.e., 3-5 m), and sand substrate.

We have developed an individual-based model that includes the effect of varying prey density, turbulence, and temperature. Temperature effects were included by using a Q(10)-type adjustment to the standard metabolic rate as well as a second temperature-dependent term added to the overall ingestion ability of our model fish, a function of the swimming speed, capture efficiency, and "liveliness" of a fish. Three cases were analyzed: (i) constant food and temperature conditions, (ii) variable temperature cycles, and (iii) variable temperature cycles plus turbulence. We found that prey density, turbulence, and temperature ranges typical of the peak spawning season are variable enough to be Limiting to larval growth. The timing and location of spawning are crucial to the survival of the larvae. Increasing the average temperature cycle by 1 degrees C, as might occur due to climatological change or interannual variability, increased growth for larvae that were not growing well previously. The increased temperature failed to increase larval growth in areas where larvae were already growing at rates close to their maximum.									29	0	0	0	25	0	29			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000078991300004

Assessment of Juvenile Chinook Salmon Rearing Habitat Potential Prior to Species Reintroduction								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				39	4			762	777		10.1002/nafm.10309				AUG 2019	2019	Successful Pacific salmon reintroduction into rivers where they have been extirpated requires understanding the range of habitats and environmental conditions that currently exist and their ability to support target species. Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were extirpated from the San Joaquin River, California, over 60 years ago and are targeted for reintroduction into the system. To assess the remaining habitat along the longitudinal lower San Joaquin River gradient, juvenile Chinook Salmon were reared within an Alluvial Site, a Transitional Site, and two lowland sites (Lowland Cinnamon Slough and Lowland Eastside Bypass) during two rearing periods (early and late). The highest Chinook Salmon growth rates were observed during the early rearing period within the lowland sites when water temperatures were moderate and prey densities were greatest. However, high-water events precluded a spatial comparison of growth with that of fish reared at the Alluvial and Transitional sites during the early period. In the late rearing period, the lowest and highest growth rates were observed at the Lowland Eastside Bypass (lowest prey abundance) and Lowland Cinnamon Slough (highest prey abundance), respectively. Growth rates at the Alluvial and Transitional sites were intermediate between those at the two lowland sites. Main-channel (Alluvial and Transitional) growth rates were generally lower than those within the lowland sites, suggesting that main-channel restoration may require targeted food web enhancement. Our results indicate that lowland floodplain sites can provide quality rearing habitat and growth benefits early in the rearing season. As temperatures increase, salmon can continue to grow if sufficient prey is available. Managers considering measures for improving floodplain access to provide juvenile Chinook Salmon rearing habitat should consider interactions between environmental conditions and prey density-and how these factors vary along the river continuum-to determine when these habitats can provide the greatest growth benefit.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000481873200013

We tested the effects of low pH and high temperature at levels predicted for 2100 on an ecologically important predator-prey system (sea stars, Asterias rubens, and mussels, Mytilus edulis) from the NW Atlantic coast. Mussels are dominant competitors for space and important ecosystem engineers, while sea stars control mussel populations and thus local community structure. We found sea stars to be negatively affected in growth rate by low pH, with growth further reduced by a high temperature. In contrast, mussel growth rate was positively affected by low pH, with no response to temperature within the tested range. Predation of sea stars on mussels, measured as per-capita consumption rate, decreased in acidified conditions by 50%. Our study suggests that mussels may not be negatively affected by pH at the levels predicted for the end of this century and that mussels may be subjected to a reduced predation from sea stars under future conditions.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			1745-1000	1745-1019		WOS:000350983000001

We designed an experiment to determine if larvae require continuous exposure to live prey, or if feeding in "pulses" is adequate to promote good growth and survival. Larvae of yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferrugineus) were fed once (1 x, at 10 AM), twice (2 x, at 10 AM and 10 PM), four times (4 x, at 10 AM, 4 PM, 10 PM and 4 AM), or continuously (by automatic feeder) at 8000 prey per liter (p/1). Larval growth, survival, and foraging behavior were monitored during weeks 1-7 post-hatch. Larval growth rate was significantly reduced in the 1 x treatment. The growth rate of larvae was similar in other treatments. Larval survival was lowest in the 1 x treatment, but was not significantly affected by feeding frequency. The consumption rate of larvae in the 1 x and 2 x treatments was significantly higher than that of larvae in the continuous treatment. This behavioral response to hunger probably enabled larvae in the 2 x treatment to grow as rapidly as larvae in the continuous prey treatment. It is concluded that yellowtail flounder larvae do not require continuous exposure to high prey densities and there may be potential to reduce the cost of live food and labor in the culture of this and possibly other species.

Small juvenile halibut were able to grow and maintain water balance over almost the entire ranges of water temperatures and salinities tested, except at 14degreesC and 8 ppt, where they lost weight but gained about 2 % body water. Large juvenile halibut were far less tolerant of variations in water temperature and salinity. Regardless of salinity, large juvenile halibut exposed to 14 and 25degreesC lost weight due to greatly reduced energy intake, and experienced >90% mortality at 28degreesC; in diluted seawater at 14 and 25degreesC they also experienced water balance problems. Only at 20degreesC did surplus energy and lack of water balance problems allow large juvenile halibut to grow across all salinities. Differences in energetic and water balance responses of small and large juvenile halibut correspond to the habitat preferences of each size group. Small juvenile halibut are estuarine, and their ability to tolerate wide variations in water temperatures and salinities allows them to exploit estuaries and coastal lagoons with abundant small prey (gobies), warm temperatures, and few predators. However, in winter, with the increased probability of estuarine or lagoon mouth closures, water temperatures and salinity can rapidly drop to levels unfavorable for growth of small juvenile halibut. Large juvenile halibut, with their reduced tolerance for varying temperatures and salinities, must migrate from lagoons and estuaries into open-coast environments, where they also benefit from abundant large prey. Closure of river mouths likely pose the greatest risk to large juvenile halibut, should they become trapped in cold, hyposaline coastal wetlands.									25	0	0	0	24	1	26			0171-8630			WOS:000179689200020

Temperature can further alter size-dependent, predator-prey relationships through changes in species' behavior. We thus hypothesized that phenological shifts due to climate warming would alter the predator-prey dynamic in a larval amphibian community through changes in body size and behavior of both the predator and prey. We utilized an amphibian predator-prey system common to the montane wetlands of the U.S. Pacific Northwest: the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and its anuran prey, the Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla). We conducted predation trials to test if changes in predator phenology and environmental temperature influence predation success. We simulated predator phenological shifts using different size classes of the long-toed salamander representing an earlier onset of breeding while using spring temperatures corresponding to early and mid-season larval rearing conditions. Our results indicated that the predator-prey dynamic was highly dependent upon predator phenology and temperature, and both acted synergistically. Increased size asymmetry resulted in higher tadpole predation rates and tadpole tail damage. Both predators and prey altered activity and locomotor performance in warmer treatments. Consequently, behavioral modifications resulted in decreased survival rates of tadpoles in the presence of large salamander larvae. If predators shift to breed disproportionately earlier than prey due to climate warming, this has the potential to negatively impact tadpole populations in high-elevation amphibian assemblages through changes in predation rates mediated by behavior.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000461360700021	30810801

Developmental time (egg to adult) significantly decreased with increase in the temperature. It lasted 27.5 days at 25 +/- 1 degrees C and 21.3 days at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. The development threshold of R. lophanthae immature stages was 7.823 degrees C, while the thermal constant was 472.379 degree-days. No mortality was recorded during the incubation period. The total mortality rate amongst the larval instars was with 3.33% at 25 +/- 1 degrees C and 6.77% at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. The sex ratio male to female was 1:1.06. The consumption rate significantly increased with increasing temperatures and within the larval instars. The four larval instar consumed 24.3 and 33.5 adults of A. nerii at 25 +/- 1 and 30 +/- 1 degrees C, respectively.

Consumption of mixotrophic microzooplankton, which are both autotrophic and heterotrophic within the same individual, is of particular interest because of its influence on carbon transfer efficiency within aquatic food webs. In Lake Baikal, Siberia, it is unknown how carbon from a well-developed microbial food web present during summer stratification moves into higher trophic levels within the classical food web. We conducted in situ experiments in August 2015 to test the hypotheses that: (a) the lake's dominant endemic copepod (Epischura baikalensis), previously assumed to be an herbivore feeding on diatoms, connects the microbial and classical food webs by ingesting ciliates; and (b) this feeding initiates top-down effects within the microbial food web. Our results supported these hypotheses. E. baikalensis individuals consumed on average 101-161 ciliates per day, obtaining 96%-98% of their ingested carbon from ciliates and the remainder from small diatoms. Clearly, E. baikalensis is omnivorous, and it is probably channelling more primary production from both the microbial food web and the classical food web of Lake Baikal to higher trophic levels than any other pelagic consumer. Most ciliates consumed were a mixotrophic oligotrich and such taxa are often abundant in summer in other oligotrophic lakes. Consumption of these mixotrophs is likely to boost substantially the transfer efficiency of biomass to higher trophic levels with potential implications for fish production, but this has seldom been investigated in oligotrophic lakes. Feeding of E. baikalensis initiated a three-link predatory cascade which reduced the abundance of ciliates and elevated growth rates of heterotrophic nanoflagellates but did not affect abundance or growth rates of autotrophic picoplankton. This demonstration of a potential trophic cascade in Lake Baikal indicates that investigations at larger spatial-temporal scales are needed to identify the conditions promoting or precluding trophic cascades in this lake.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000453853500011		
J	Laurel, Benjamin J.; Copeman, Louise A.; Spencer, Mara; Iseri, Paul								Temperature-dependent growth as a function of size and age in juvenile Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida)								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				74	6			1614	1621		10.1093/icesjms/fsx028				JUL-AUG 2017	2017	Forecasting climate-driven ecosystem impacts in the Arctic is currently limited by the availability of biological data on key species. In this study, we carried out a series of temperature-dependent growth experiments on juvenile Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), an important forage fish species at the Atlantic-and Pacific-Arctic interface. Multi-week growth experiments were conducted across a range of temperatures (-1 to 16 degrees C), ages (age-0 and age-1) and sizes (45-125 mm SL) to determine best-fit temperature-dependent growth models. Temperature-dependent growth models considered were 1) a single model using pooled fish of mixed ages and sizes (Model A), separate models for age 0 and age 1 fish (Model B-0 and B-1), and a Lorentzian three-dimensional model incorporating size but not age (Model C). All juvenile Arctic cod demonstrated relatively high growth at cold temperatures (< 2 degrees C; similar to 0.75-1.00% d(-1)) with a deceleration in growth rate above 6.4 degrees C and 9.0 degrees C for age-1 and age-0 cod respectively. As such, Model A did not explain as much temperature-dependent growth (R-2 = 51%) as Model B-0 (R-2 = 98%) and Model B-1 (R-2 = 93%). Model C did reasonably well in explaining growth over a continuous range of sizes (R-2 = 71%) but explained less variance than either of the age models (Model B). These results stress the importance of considering the early ontogenetic effects on temperature-dependent growth variation in juvenile Arctic cod when projecting climate-driven changes in Arctic marine ecosystems.									15	0	0	0	11	0	15			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000406598500012

Results were combined to assess the relative potential of fish predation to impact zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). Predicted annual food consumption by fishes in southern waters was over 100% greater than that in northern systems because of warmer annual water temperatures and presumed increases in metabolic demand. Although generally increasing with latitude, biomasses of several key zebra mussel fish predators did not change significantly across latitudes. Biomasses of some less abundant fish predators did increase significantly with latitude, but increases were not of the magnitude to offset predicted decreases in food consumption. Our results generally support the premise that fishes in rivers and lakes of the southern United States (U.S.) have inherently greater potential to impact zebra mussels by predation. Our simulations may provide a partial explanation of why zebra mussel invasions have not been as rapid and widespread in southern U.S. waters compared to the Great Lakes region.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000221298900002

A test with feeding rates of a generalist stream predator								ECOLOGY				99	7			1591	1601		10.1002/ecy.2387				JUL 2018	2018	Describing the mechanisms that drive variation in species interaction strengths is central to understanding, predicting, and managing community dynamics. Multiple factors have been linked to trophic interaction strength variation, including species densities, species traits, and abiotic factors. Yet most empirical tests of the relative roles of multiple mechanisms that drive variation have been limited to simplified experiments that may diverge from the dynamics of natural food webs. Here, we used a field-based observational approach to quantify the roles of prey density, predator density, predator-prey body-mass ratios, prey identity, and abiotic factors in driving variation in feeding rates of reticulate sculpin (Cottus perplexus). We combined data on over 6,000 predator-prey observations with prey identification time functions to estimate 289 prey-specific feeding rates at nine stream sites in Oregon. Feeding rates on 57 prey types showed an approximately log-normal distribution, with few strong and many weak interactions. Model selection indicated that prey density, followed by prey identity, were the two most important predictors of prey-specific sculpin feeding rates. Feeding rates showed a positive relationship with prey taxon densities that was inconsistent with predator saturation predicted by current functional response models. Feeding rates also exhibited four orders-of-magnitude in variation across prey taxonomic orders, with the lowest feeding rates observed on prey with significant anti-predator defenses. Body-mass ratios were the third most important predictor variable, showing a hump-shaped relationship with the highest feeding rates at intermediate ratios. Sculpin density was negatively correlated with feeding rates, consistent with the presence of intraspecific predator interference. Our results highlight how multiple co-occurring drivers shape trophic interactions in nature and underscore ways in which simplified experiments or reliance on scaling laws alone may lead to biased inferences about the structure and dynamics of species-rich food webs.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000436869900009	29738085

Meanwhile, recent climate change in freshwater ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran is expected to cause undesirable impact. We conducted experiments in 2 levels of temperature and predator density including: high temperature/high predator (HT/HP), high temperature/ low predator (HT/LP), low temperature/high predator (LT/HP), and low temperature/low predator (LT/LP) that carried out within 20 days. Larval growth rate was highest at the HT/HP (0.29 mm/day), development stage was slowest at the LT/HP treatment (Gosner: 28.33 +/- 0.33), and survival rate was lowest at HT/HP treatment (0.00%). Except for the significant impact of predator density on survival, B. variabilis was tolerant of both predator density and increased temperature and there was no interaction between predator density and increased temperature in term of growth, development and survival. But, combined effects of temperature and predator density showed significant effects on growth, metamorphosis, and survival over time.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1067-4136	1608-3334		WOS:000466397600011

Effects of temperature and density on consumption of trout eggs by Orconectes propinquus and O-rusticus								JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH				33	1			7	14		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[7:EOTADO]2.0.CO;2				MAR 2007	2007	Using laboratory experiments, we assessed the effect of temperature and predator density on consumption of trout eggs by crayfish. We quantified the effect of four temperature ranges (2-3, 4-5, 7-8, and 10-12 degrees C) on consumption of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs by a native (Orconectes propinquus) and an exotic (Orconectes rusticus) crayfish found in the Great Lakes. Mean individual consumption ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 lake trout eggs per day and from 1.0 to 5.5 rainbow trout eggs per day, respectively. Temperature influenced consumption for O. rusticus feeding on rainbow trout eggs but not O. propinquus. The effect of conspecific predator competition con rainbow trout egg consumption was evaluated using three densities of crayfish (1, 5, 10 per tank). For O. rusticus, mean individual consumption rate was higher at the lowest crawfish density (1 crayfish/tank) than at medium (5 crayfish/tank) or high (10 crayfish/tank) densities. A similar conspecific effect was not evident in O. propinquus and total consumption per unit area increased with crayfish density. The effect of competition among crayfish species on consumption of rainbow trout eggs was examined by comparing feeding rates at high crayfish abundance levels in single and mixed species treatments. Mixed species interactions did not significantly alter crayfish feeding rates. Results from these experiments provide empirical data to aid in modeling how temperature and predator density affect lake trout egg predation rates in the field.									17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0380-1330			WOS:000245692400002

No development occurred at 40A degrees C. The total development time from egg to adult emergence for females was estimated to be 48.1, 22.8, 13.6, 10.6, 8.3 and 9.6 days, respectively. The development time decreased with increasing temperature from 15 to 35A degrees C. In the temperature range of 15-37A degrees C, egg and larval mortality varied between 10% and 48% and 1.92% and 11.1%, respectively. The sex-ratio of S. longicornis was in favor of females at all tested temperatures and remained uninfluenced by temperature in the range of 15-35A degrees C with an average of about 75% females. The lower temperature threshold for the entire development period and the thermal constant for female S. longicornis using the common linear model were estimated to be 11.1A degrees C and 200 degree-days (DD), and 10.8A degrees C and 204 DD using the Ikemoto and Takai model. Data were fitted to four nonlinear development rate models and the thermal thresholds (T (min) and T (max)) and optimal temperature (T (opt)) estimated. The Briere-1, Briere-2, and Ikemoto and Takai linear models provided adequate descriptions of temperature-dependent development of S. longicornis. The upper temperature threshold was estimated to be about 42A degrees C. Temperature-dependent development data, thermal requirements and temperature thresholds can be used to predict the occurrence, number of generations and population dynamics of S. longicornis, an important biocontrol agent of T. urticae.									23	0	0	0	23	0	23			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000290342100002

Change in the North Sea ecosystem from the 1970s to the 2010s: great skua diets reflect changing forage fish, seabirds, and fisheries								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				76	4			925	937		10.1093/icesjms/fsy165				JUL-AUG 2019	2019	Understanding anthropogenic impacts are crucial to maintain marine ecosystem health. The North Sea has changed in recent decades, largely due to commercial fishing and climate change. Seabirds can act as useful indicators of these changes. By analyzing n=20 013 pellets and n=24 993 otoliths regurgitated by great skuas Stercorarius skua in northern Scotland over five decades from the 1970s to the 2010s (in 36years 1973-2017), we reveal how the diet of this top predator has changed alongside the changing North Sea ecosystem. Sandeels Ammodytes spp. were the most common dietary item during the 1970s, but became virtually absent from the 1980s onward. Discarded whitefish dominated skua diets from the 1980s to the present day, despite long-term declines in North Sea discard production. However, the discarded fish eaten by great skuas has become smaller and the species composition changed. Skua pellets only rarely contained avian prey in the 1970s but this increased during the 1980s, and fluctuated between 10% and 20% from the 1990s to 2010s. There have also been changes in the avian prey in the diet-black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla generally being replaced by auks Alcid spp. and northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis. The Shetland marine ecosystem has experienced steep declines in sandeel stocks and in seabirds that feed on them. Great skuas have been able to prey switch to respond to this change, supported by abundant discards, enabling them to maintain a favourable population status while other seabird species have declined.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000484404900014

Metabolic responses to temperature in a sedentary reef fish, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli, Gilbert)								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				501				83	89		10.1016/j.jembe.2018.01.011				APR 2018	2018	As climate continues to change, many marine species will experience both an increase in average temperature and more extreme diel and seasonal fluctuations. Understanding how these variations in ocean temperature affect processes such as metabolism and energy consumption is important for many species, and may be particularly important for sedentary species that cannot make large-scale movements in response to changes in environmental conditions. We examined how metabolic rates and energetic demands responded to temperature in a temperate reef fish, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli). Using respirometry, we estimated resting oxygen consumption (V02) for 42 L. dalli individuals of varying sizes and calculated metabolic rates (MR) at three different temperatures (13 degrees C, 16 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). As predicted, V02 and MR increased significantly with temperature and mass, but the rate of temperature-dependent increase in metabolism indicated a very high degree of thermal sensitivity for L. dalli (Q10 value for VO2 was 5.21 across the range of experimental temperatures). The mass-scaling exponent (b) was estimated to be 0.95 and aligned closely with other benthic species. Our results suggest that changes in temperature especially those that occur over weeks and seasons likely play a significant role in the ecology of these gobies. Long-term increases in seawater temperature will either necessitate an increase in foraging and consumption, or drive costly trade-offs between metabolism and processes such as growth and reproduction.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000427664700009

A case study in avocado agro-ecosystems in Spain								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				59	1-2			27	42		10.1007/s10493-012-9560-y				FEB 2013	2013	Climate change is one of the most important factors affecting the phenology, distribution, composition and diversity of organisms. In agricultural systems many pests and natural enemies are arthropods. As poikilotherm organisms, their body temperature is highly dependent on environmental conditions. Because higher trophic levels typically have lower tolerance to high temperatures than lower trophic levels, trends towards increasing local or regional temperatures may affect the strength of predator/prey interactions and disrupt pest control. Furthermore, increasing temperatures may create climate corridors that could facilitate the invasion and establishment of invasive species originating from warmer areas. In this study we examined the effect of environmental conditions on the dynamics of an agro-ecosystem community located in southern Spain, using field data on predator/prey dynamics and climate gathered during four consecutive years. The study system was composed of an ever-green tree species (avocado), an exotic tetranychid mite, and two native species of phytoseiid mites found in association with this new pest. We also present a climatological analysis of the temperature trend in the area of study during the last 28 years, as evidence of temperature warming occurring in the area. We found that the range of temperatures with positive per capita growth rates was much wider in prey than in predators, and that relative humidity contributed to explain the growth rate variation in predators, but not in prey. Predator and prey differences in thermal performance curves could explain why natural enemies did not respond numerically to the pest when environmental conditions were harsh.									18	0	0	0	16	1	18			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000313653200003	22527837

Investigations on its use in cucumber greenhouses against Aphis gossypii, the release of larvae and adult forms had shown satisfactory results. The efficiency level of this ladybird is a function of the ratio predator/prey and on the level of the aphid population at the moment of the ladybird release. The effect of density of the prey on the fecundity and the settlement of this ladybird under greenhouse conditions were also studied.

Grizzly bear consumption of midges in Yellowstone National Park								URSUS				29	1			51	57		10.2192/URSUS-D-17-00029.1				DEC 2018	2018	Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) are omnivore generalists that eat a wide array of plants and animals, including insects. Human-induced changes in climate may affect the species composition, abundance, range, and elevational distribution of the plants and animals consumed by grizzly bears. Therefore, determining the current food habits of grizzly bears is important for documenting future changes in food resources and how those changes may affect the nutritional ecology of grizzlies. In 2011, we observed grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) eating midges from the family Chironomidae along the shoreline of Yellowstone Lake. Midges are small, swarming aquatic insects that occasionally wash ashore in large numbers around the lake. To our knowledge, grizzly bear consumption of midges had not previously been reported in YNP despite extensive bear food-habits studies conducted there. We believe that midges are likely an opportunistic food for grizzlies, eaten only during sporadic periods of super-abundance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1537-6176	1938-5439		WOS:000452083500006

In contrast, warming of oceans from climate change may increase bottom-up effects from increases in primary productivity. An ecosystem model of a large pelagic ecosystem off eastern Australia was constructed to explore the potential ecological effects of climate change and longlining by Australia's Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery. The model reproduced historic biomass and fishery catch trends from 1952 to 2006 for seven functional groups. Simulated changes in fishing effort and fishing mortality rate on individual target species from 2008 to 2018 resulted in only modest (< 20%) changes in the biomass of target species and their direct predators or competitors. A simulated increase in phytoplankton biomass due to climate change resulted in only small increases (< 11%) in the biomass of all groups. However, climate-related changes to the biomass of micronekton fish (-20%) and cephalopods (+50%) resulted in trophic cascades. Our results suggest there may be ecological redundancy among high trophic level predators since they share a diverse suite of prey and collectively only represent < 1% of the total system biomass. In contrast, micronekton fishes and cephalopods have high biomasses and high production and consumption rates and are important as both prey and predators. They appear to exert 'wasp-waist' control of the ecosystem rather than top-down or bottom-up processes reported to drive other pelagic systems.									52	0	0	0	37	0	52			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000277416500006

Although the consequences of variation in temperature for the development and reproduction of insects are generally appreciated, the consequences of potential interactions between temperature and prey for predatory insects are not. Thermal requirements and predation rates were determined for T. notata at different constant temperatures with both prey species. T. notata larvae developed to adults in experimental conditions > 18 to <38 degrees C. The upper thermal limit for egg hatch was 34 degrees C and for pupation was 33 degrees C. Adults reared at >= 32 degrees C did not lay eggs and survived less than 1 week. Prey species did not affect lower temperature thresholds or thermal constants for development from egg to adult. Furthermore, prey did not affect a number of reproductive traits, but the interaction between temperature and prey affected changes in developmental times and oviposition rate with age. Predation rate of T. notata increased as a function of temperature, and T. notata adults generally consumed more nymphs of P. citri than F. dasyrilii. These findings indicate that T. notata is well adapted to the tropical and sub-tropical temperatures and may prove useful for the biological control of some native and non-native mealybugs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1758	2052-174X		WOS:000507852900001

Temporary patches where sown plants are poorly developed (hereafter "field defects") are likely to increase with climate change and can be colonized by other plant species. Although perennial non-crop habitats can act as refuges for beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes and increase ecosystem services (ESs) in neighbouring arable fields, the relevance of field defects is unknown. Here, we quantified two ESs (pest and weed seed predation) in field defects within oilseed rape crops and related the ES levels with the activity-density of ground beetles and temperature. In 10 fields, we used artificial caterpillars made of plasticine and seed cards of two weed species (Taraxacum sp. and Stellaria sp.) to quantify the ESs in two sampling periods (spring and summer) and three habitat types: field defects, crops grown in standard conditions (field interiors) and crop-defect boundaries. Ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps and classified into feeding guilds and body-size classes. Insects and mammals were the main pest predators, and predation increased in summer but did not differ among habitats. Seed predation rates for both species were significantly higher in summer. Predation upon Taraxacum seeds was higher in the field interiors, whereas the predation rate upon Stellaria seeds was significantly higher in the field interiors and defects compared to that in the crop-defect boundaries. The predation rate by insects increased with the activity-density of the medium- and large-sized carnivorous carabids, whereas the seed predation rate for both weed species was positively related to the activity-density of medium-sized herbivorous carabids. Finally, the mean and maximum temperatures were negatively linked to the predation rates on artificial caterpillars and seeds of Taraxacum, respectively. Our results suggest that these ephemeral habitats are not related to a strong decrease in ecosystem services; thus, field defects may not cause substantial changes in ES provisioning. We confirmed that ground beetles are important providers of both investigated ESs and showed that microclimatic conditions might play an important role in the regulation of ESs in agroeco-systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000527595400012

High temperatures may limit the ascent due to; direct effects on survival or through decreased feeding rates. Mysis relicta survival (over 8 hours) was high up to 17 degrees C (93%) and decreased with an increase in temperature over 18 degrees C to 0% at 26 degrees C. Feeding rates on newly hatched nauplii of Artemia salina were measured in 1-hour experiments at temperatures between 4 and 20 degrees C. Feeding rates for 13 to 16 mm mysids were highest at 12 degrees C and decreased at both higher and lower temperatures to 40% of peak feeding rates at 18 to 20 degrees C and to 75% of peak feeding rates at 4 degrees C. Smaller mysids (average length 10.5 mm) had peak feeding rates at 14 degrees C. These results are consistent with field observations. Mysids seldom occur in temperatures above 15 degrees C and smaller mysids are often found higher in the water column than larger animals. Consumption rates at both higher and lower temperatures were higher relative to peak consumption than assumed in a published bioenergetics model for Mysis (Rudstam 1989).									29	0	0	0	29	0	29			0380-1330			WOS:000081807600014

Here we combine the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) with metabolism and consumption measurements of a model organism, the urchin Lytechinus variegatus, to test how climate change will affect consumer fitness. Unexpectedly, we found that metabolism and consumption exhibit different scaling relationships with temperature and are mismatched at high temperatures. This led to a dramatic reduction in ingestion efficiency and potentially in consumer fitness. Using meta-analysis, we showed that such temperature-driven mismatches between consumption and metabolism are common across taxa and frequently lead to reduced consumer fitness. Our empirical and synthetic analyses identify a mechanism by which climate change reduces the fitness of ectotherm consumers that may be applied to a broad array of taxonomic groups. Moreover, we showed that the assumptions of MTE do not hold at temperatures near the upper range of species' thermal tolerances for a wide array of taxa. Models using MTE to predict the effects of climate change on consumer-resource dynamics may therefore be underestimating the consequences of rising temperatures on population and community dynamics.									90	1	0	0	88	0	91			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000310834900019	23236919

Recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale mechanistic explanations-or "paradigms of change"-that attempt to synthesize our understanding of past and current changes. In many cases, these paradigms are based on observations that are spatially and temporally patchy. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of Earth's most rapidly changing regions, has been an area of particular research focus. A recently proposed mechanistic explanation for observed changes in the WAP region relates changes in penguin populations to variability in krill biomass and regional warming. While this scheme is attractive for its simplicity and chronology, it may not account for complex spatio-temporal processes that drive ecosystem dynamics in the region. It might also be difficult to apply to other Antarctic regions that are experiencing some, though not all, of the changes documented for the WAP. We use qualitative network models of differing levels of complexity to test paradigms of change for the WAP ecosystem. Importantly, our approach captures the emergent effects of feedback processes in complex ecological networks and provides a means to identify and incorporate uncertain linkages between network elements. Our findings highlight key areas of uncertainty in the drivers of documented trends, and suggest that a greater level of model complexity is needed in devising explanations for ecosystem change in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that our network approach to evaluating a recent and widely cited paradigm of change for the Antarctic region could be broadly applied in hypothesis testing for other regions and research fields.									28	0	0	0	19	0	28			1932-6203			WOS:000315153400060	23405116

To explore this, we grew replicate Paramecium caudatum populations in either constant or variable temperatures and exposed half to predation. We then fit thermal performance curves (TPCs) of intrinsic growth rate (r(max)) for each replicate population (N = 12) across seven temperatures (10 degrees C-38 degrees C). TPCs of P. caudatum exposed to both temperature variability and predation responded only to one or the other (but not both), resulting in unpredictable outcomes. These changes in TPCs were accompanied by changes in cell morphology. Although cell volume was conserved across treatments, cells became narrower in response to temperature variability and rounder in response to predation. Our findings suggest that predation and temperature variability produce conflicting pressures on both thermal performance and cell morphology. Lastly, we found a strong correlation between changes in cell morphology and TPC parameters in response to predation, suggesting that responses to opposing selective pressures could be constrained by trade-offs. Our results shed new light on how environmental and ecological pressures interact to elicit changes in characteristics at both the individual and population levels. We further suggest that morphological responses to interactive environmental forces may modulate population-level responses, making prediction of long-term responses to environmental change challenging.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000506457200001	32076520	
J	Krohn, Martha; Reidy, Shannon; Kerr, Stephen								Bioenergetic analysis of the effects of temperature and prey availability on growth and condition of northern cod (Gadus morhua)								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				54				113	121		10.1139/cjfas-54-S1-113			1	1997	1997	Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks of the Northwest Atlantic have experienced steady decreases in growth rate since 1989 and in physiological condition since 1988. The declines have been attributed to various factors, including size-selective fishing pressure, anomalously low temperature fields, and a decline in available prey. The precise balance of these factors is unknown. We applied simple correlation models to determine that bottom water temperature and capelin (Mallotus villosus) biomass together explain 52% of the interannual variance in mean condition of 2J3K cod and 23% of the interannual variance in 2J3KL mean cod growth rates. Bioenergetic models can potentially improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind these relationships because they allocate energy as a function of environmental parameters such as water temperature and prey consumption. We developed a bioenergetic model for Atlantic cod to determine whether temperature could explain the observed decreases in growth rate of northern cod stocks. Our results suggest that the low growth rates of 2J3K northern cod observed in recent years are not due to physiological temperature limitation, while the growth rates of cod inhabiting cooler waters on the northern Grand Banks (3L) may, at least in certain years, be temperature limited.									64	1	0	0	59	0	66			0706-652X			WOS:000207611500015

We analyse the relative importance of changes in climate (mean and variability, including relevant time-lags) and habitat conditions on the abundance, age structure and growth rate of Mediterranean populations of a small endotherm, the greater white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula, along a 10-year period (2008-2017). Habitat type and season were the key factors shaping shrew population dynamics, which showed consistent peak numbers in open habitats in autumn, after the spring-summer reproductive period. Significant increases in aridity (increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall) along the study period did not explain variation in shrew numbers, although short-term variations in abundance were negatively related to relative air humidity and temperature over three last months prior to the surveys. Overall, ongoing climate change have not yet affected shrew population dynamics in its core areas of the Mediterranean region, in spite of expectations based on climate change rate in this region and small endotherm sensitivity to these changes. Reliance on open habitats with lower predation pressure would explain the resilience of shrew populations to climate change. However, current trends of land use change (land abandonment and afforestation) threaten Mediterranean open habitats, so that resilience would not last for long if these trends are not counteracted.

These interactions can change with warming, depending on the foraging mode of the predator. Theory predicts that warming increases foraging velocity in ectotherms, but in a sit-and-wait predator that has zero velocity when foraging, the interaction strength should be temperature independent. Using the protist Urocentrum turbo and the sit-and-wait copepod Orthocyclops modestus, we tested this prediction by measuring dynamic interaction strengths (effect of a predator on prey population growth rate) and by estimating the parameters of a functional response. Both of these metrics were consistent with the prediction that interaction strength is temperature independent in a sit-and-wait predator. Our results indicate that there may be considerable variability in how warming alters foraging interactions, and estimating the overall effects of climate change on food webs may require consideration of the distribution of foraging strategies and the potential asymmetries that arise with interactions that involve different strategies.									15	1	0	0	15	1	16			2150-8925			WOS:000345097200015

Developmental time (egg to adult) of S. levaillanti significantly decreased with increasing temperatures, ranging from 63.9 days at 15 degreesC to 11.1 days at 35 degreesC. Development from egg to adult required 305.2 DD above a developmental threshold estimated as 11.7 degreesC. Oviposition periods lasted 86.5, 76.1, 47.2, and 31.5 days at 20, 25, 30 and 35 degreesC, respectively. No eggs were deposited at 15 degreesC. Higher temperatures resulted in shorter generation times (T(O)) and in decreased net reproductive rates (R(O)) of the coccinellid. S. levaillanti kept at 30 degreesC produced 0.151 females/female/day, the highest per capita rate of population growth (r(m)). The `functional response' of larvae and adults of S. levaillanti matches well that described by Holling (1959) as Type 2. Daily number of eggs deposited by females increased to a plateau with increasing prey density. Results obtained here provide information about the biology of S. levaillanti, and its feeding capacity indicates that it may act as an important control agent.									27	0	0	0	34	0	34			1386-6141			WOS:000165812900006		
J	Barton, Brandon T.; Ives, Anthony R.								Direct and indirect effects of warming on aphids, their predators, and ant mutualists								ECOLOGY				95	6			1479	1484		10.1890/13-1977.1				JUN 2014	2014	Species exist within communities of other interacting species, so an exogenous force that directly affects one species can indirectly affect all other members of the community. In the case of climate change, many species may be affected directly and subsequently initiate numerous indirect effects that propagate throughout the community. Therefore, the net effect of climate change on any one species is a function of the direct and indirect effects. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on corn leaf aphids, a pest of corn and other grasses, by performing an experimental manipulation of temperature, predators, and two common aphid-tending ants. Although warming had a positive direct effect on aphid population growth rate, warming reduced aphid abundance when ants and predators were present. This occurred because winter ants, which aggressively defend aphids from predators under control temperatures, were less aggressive toward predators and less abundant when temperatures were increased. In contrast, warming increased the abundance of cornfield ants, but they did not protect aphids from predators with the same vigor as winter ants. Thus, warming broke down the ant-aphid mutualism and counterintuitively reduced the abundance of this agricultural pest.									44	0	0	0	38	0	44			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000337218500007	25039213

In this experiment we reared juvenile cuttlefish, Sepia elliptica, under two. feeding regimes (satiation and half satiation) and two temperature regimes (25 and 30 degrees C). This study examined differences in somatic growth, muscle tissue structure and composition as a function of temperature and food levels. We estimated body mass and the concentration of water, carbohydrate, protein and lipid in the mantle muscle tissue for each individual. Both high water temperature and high feeding rations increased growth rates. Temperature appeared to change the rates of muscle fibre generation and fibre growth similarly. In contrast, the ration level altered the relative rates of fibre production and fibre growth. The muscle tissue of individuals reared at 30 degrees C had higher concentrations of carbohydrate and protein. In contrast, increasing ration levels only increased carbohydrate concentrations in the muscle tissue; The muscle tissue of reared juveniles had lower concentrations of carbohydrate and protein than wild individuals of similar size. In conclusion, water temperature and feeding levels both affect somatic growth, but the nature of the effect at the sub-organismal level differs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We examined how the low tide body temperature of the rocky intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus affected the rate at which this keystone species fed on the mussel Mytilus californianus. Patterns of intertidal distribution and sea star body temperatures were recorded in the field at Bodega Bay, California, in 2006 and 2007. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we separately examined the roles of short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposures to high aerial body temperatures in driving patterns of feeding and growth. Upper limits to thermal tolerance were also quantified in the laboratory. Integrating field data on the vertical distribution, microhabitat, and body temperature of sea stars indicated that individuals typically experienced relatively high body temperatures over a series of short periods of time (acute exposures of a few days) and that they escaped from situations where they would have experienced such temperatures for longer periods (chronic exposure). Although sea stars never approached their upper thermal limit (35 degrees C), laboratory trials demonstrated that chronic exposure to realistic peak aerial body temperatures (>= 23 degrees C) negatively affected both feeding and growth rates, whereas acute exposure had positive consequences on feeding rates but no effects on growth. Variations in aerial body temperature, and more specifically the frequency of exposure to high body temperatures, can influence interaction strength in this important predator -prey system.									97	1	0	0	90	0	97			0024-3590			WOS:000257773700033

Laboratory experiments were designed to estimate the favorable prey size of C. uritai through back-calculation of body length (BL) of P. yokohamae from sagittal otolith diameter observed in the stomachs of C. uritai. The most favorable prey-predator size ratio (BL of P. yokohamae-total length (TL) of C. uritai) class was 0.15-0.19, and ranged from 0.12-0.31. There was a significant positive correlation between the BL increase of P. yokohamae and the bottom water temperature in the field, such that BLs stagnated during the cold year of 1999 from April to June, and increased during the warm year of 2002. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between the TL increase of C. uritai and the bottom water temperature. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the mean TL of C. uritai between months (April-June) or years (1998-2002). Variation of PPI depended on the relationships between the growth rates of P. yokohamae and bottom water temperature. Therefore, the warm year of 2002 resulted in higher potential predation impact (PPI >= 20), and it was at least 20 days shorter than that of the cold year of 1999. These results suggest that increased bottom water temperature in the nursery area was one of the most important factors for cumulative predation loss.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0919-9268	1444-2906		WOS:000243868200015

Thus, little is known regarding how the temporal interaction between multiple episodes of thermal stress influences biotic interactions. We measured the sensitivity of predation rate in an intertidal sea star to changing levels of temporal coincidence of underwater and aerial thermal stress events. In laboratory trials, we controlled for intensity, variance and temporal patterning of both underwater and aerial body temperature. Predation rate decreased as underwater and aerial thermal stress episodes became temporally non-coincident, despite a similar intensity and variance among treatments. Experiments under constant conditions were a poor predictor of more complex environmental scenarios because of these strong temporal interactions. Such temporal interactions may be widespread in various ecosystems, suggesting a strong need for empirical studies and models that link environmental complexity, physiology, behaviour and species interactions.									49	0	0	0	43	0	49			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000305000000006	22494161

Tortanus can capture prey copepods having up to approximately 100% of its own prosome length, but it only partially consumes larger prey copepods. Larger developmental stages of Tortanus tend to select larger prey. The functional response of various developmental stages of Tortanus was determined at 25, 20, and 15 degrees C, using Oithona davisae CV and CVI, numerically dominant small copepods in Fukuyama Harbor, as prey. Ingestion rate increased with increasing prey density up to maximum rate. Maximum ingestion rate was highest at 25 degrees C and decreased with decreasing temperature. Maximum specific ingestion rate at a given temperature was highest for CI-CIII and decreased for the later stages. Based on abundances of various developmental stages of Tortanus and small planktonic crustaceans (O. davisae, Parvocalanus crassirostris, and others) and the variation in water temperature in Fukuyama Harbor, the calculated predatory impact of Tortanus is small. Less than 2.7% of the prey populations are consumed per day by Tortanus.									17	0	0	0	15	0	18			0278-0372	1937-240X		WOS:A1994PD94400005

Model predictions were compared in two locations with contrasting environmental conditions, the Clyde Sea and the Kattegat. The model was constructed from a combination of parameterised functions and empirical field data obtained during summer conditions. Parameter matrices were set up to cover the entire water column over a 24-h period. The first matrix contained values for "net energy gain," which incorporated empirical data on temperature-dependent respiration, copepod and phytoplankton abundance, and a functional response model for feeding rate. The second matrix expressed the risk of encountering a generalised visual (fish) predator as a function of light levels. The optimisation procedure sought a path through depth and time such that the energy gain was equal to the amount necessary to grow, produce eggs, and moult, while the risk of predation was minimised. The model predicted DVM in both the Clyde Sea and the Kattegat. Sensitivity analyses showed that the predicted DVM pattern was mainly driven by food and predation risk, with temperature effects on metabolic costs: having a minor effect.					2nd International Symposium on Krill2nd International Symposium on Krill	AUG 23-27, 1999AUG 23-27, 1999		UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIAUNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA	32	0	0	0	25	0	33			0706-652X			WOS:000166531600006		
J	Taylor, DL; Collie, JS								A temperature- and size-dependent model of sand shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) predation on juvenile winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus)								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				60	9			1133	1148		10.1139/F03-098				SEP 2003	2003	We investigated the temperature-mediated vulnerability of postsettled winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) to sand shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) predation. Small increases in flounder growth rates substantially decreased predator-induced mortality. Recent warming trends in Northwest Atlantic estuaries can increase flounder survival by accelerating growth and minimizing the duration during which juveniles are susceptible to size-dependent predation. Extreme temperature increases, however, depress growth because a disproportionate amount of energy is devoted to increased metabolism, leaving less for somatic development. Flounder survival is also reduced during warm years because of intensified shrimp predation. Moreover, interannual variations in temperature affect the relative timing of shrimp migration and flounder settlement, thus controlling the spatial and temporal overlap between predator and prey. Predicted flounder abundance and survival were statistically unrelated to observed flounder abundance sampled annually during late spring. However, model predictions and field data suggest that flounder abundance is maximal in years when seasonally averaged temperature is approximately 16 degreesC. Above and below this temperature, flounder year-class size is considerably lower, possibly as a result of temperature effects on trophic dynamics. We conclude that shrimp predation is a significant source of mortality for postsettled flounder, but it is not the sole determinant of interannual variations in recruitment.									21	0	0	0	21	0	22			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000186366900010

In order to understand how climate and atmospheric change factors affect trophic interactions in agriculture, we evaluated the combined effect of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature on the interactions among wheat (Triticum aestivumL.),Barley yellow dwarf virusspecies PAV (BYDV-PAV) and its vector, the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padiL.). Plant traits and aphid biological parameters were examined under two climate and atmospheric scenarios, current (ambient CO(2)and temperature = 400 ppm and 20 degrees C), and future predicted (elevated CO(2)and temperature = 800 ppm and 22 degrees C), on non-infected and BYDV-PAV-infected plants. Our results show that combined elevated CO(2)and temperature increased plant growth, biomass, and carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, which in turn significantly decreased aphid fecundity and development time. However, virus infection reduced chlorophyll content, biomass, wheat growth and C:N ratio, significantly increasedR. padifecundity and development time. Regardless of virus infection, aphid growth rates remained unchanged under simulated future conditions. Therefore, asR. padiis currently a principal pest in temperate cereal crops worldwide, mainly due to its role as a plant virus vector, it will likely continue to have significant economic importance. Furthermore, an earlier and more distinct virus symptomatology was highlighted under the future predicted scenario, with consequences on virus transmission, disease epidemiology and, thus, wheat yield and quality. These research findings emphasize the complexity of plant-vector-virus interactions expected under future climate and their implications for plant disease and pest incidence in food crops.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4450		WOS:000564207400001	32707938

Growth and Survival of Age-0 Yellow Perch across Habitats in Southwestern Lake Michigan: Early Life History in a Large Freshwater Environment								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				140	5			1172	1185		10.1080/00028487.2011.608605				SEP 2011	2011	Processes regulating the survival of early life stages are difficult to decipher for fishes, especially those occupying multiple spatially segregated habitats in large complex systems. Although the processes occurring during the juvenile period are often thought to regulate recruitment of freshwater fishes, those occurring during prolonged pelagic larval phases may be more important to fishes inhabiting large dynamic systems, as is the case with marine larvae. To assess the importance of biotic and abiotic factors on growth and survival of a freshwater fish with a prolonged larval phase, we collected age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens in Lake Michigan across multiple habitats and used otoliths to estimate daily ages, hatching distributions, and growth and mortality rates. Larval yellow perch hatched near shore over a 4- to 6-week period but were quickly transported offshore, where they experienced prolonged pelagic durations. Water temperature and wind events influenced growth rates, whereas water temperature, wind events, prey availability, hatching date, and growth rate affected survival across habitats. Mechanisms regulating growth and survival of yellow perch during prolonged pelagic durations (stage duration, prey, and wind events) are consistent with recruitment mechanisms typically ascribed to marine systems, suggesting that abiotic mechanisms interact with biological factors to govern recruitment of fishes in large freshwater ecosystems.									20	0	0	0	20	0	21			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000296143900003

We examined impacts of constant and variable sublethal hypoxia exposures on multiple biological processes in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a key grazer in California Current kelp forests, which experience high variability in physical conditions. We quantified metabolic rates, grazing, growth, calcification, spine regeneration, and gonad production under constant, 3-hour variable, and 6-hour variable exposures to sublethal hypoxia, and compared responses for each hypoxia regime to normoxic conditions. Sea urchins in constant hypoxia maintained baseline metabolic rates, but had lower grazing, gonad development, and calcification rates than those in ambient conditions. The sublethal impacts of variable hypoxia differed among biological processes. Spine regrowth was reduced under all hypoxia treatments, calcification rates under variable hypoxia were intermediate between normoxia and constant hypoxia, and gonad production correlated negatively with continuous time under hypoxia. Therefore, exposure variability can differentially modulate the impacts of sublethal hypoxia, and may impact sea urchin populations and ecosystems via reduced feeding and reproduction. Addressing realistic, multifaceted stressor exposures and multiple biological responses is crucial for understanding climate change impacts on species and ecosystems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000562932000015	32060309

Both processes generate cascading impacts throughout food webs and can jeopardize important ecosystem services. We examined the impact of fish stocking on communities and ecosystems in California mountain lakes across an elevation (temperature and dissolved organic carbon) gradient to determine how trophic cascades and ecosystem function vary with climate. Here, we show that the impact of fish on the pelagic consumer-to-producer biomass ratio strengthened at low elevation, while invertebrate community composition and benthic ecosystem rates (periphyton production and litter decomposition) were most influenced by predators at high elevation. A warming climate may therefore alter the stability of lake ecosystems by shifting the strength of top-down control by introduced predators over food web structure and function.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000378318700022

Is cannibalism reflected in otolith fluctuating asymmetry?								HYDROBIOLOGIA				847	14			3139	3152		10.1007/s10750-020-04328-5				AUG 2020	2020	Cannibalism can be a significant factor limiting the survival of pike,Esox lucius, early life stages in both natural and aquaculture conditions. In the present research, type I cannibalism was studied in pike larvae (size range: 9-32.5 mm standard length, SL) in controlled conditions for 45 days post-hatching (dph). For this purpose, the occurrence of cannibalistic pairs, i.e. prey caught by a cannibal inside the cannibal's mouth, was monitored for 15 min periods by two observers six times daily. Cannibalism was not observed in fish that still had yolk-sacs, but it did occur as soon as the yolk-sac was absorbed on 5 dph at a body size of 13 mm at 22 degrees C and 10 dph at a body size of 13.4 mm at 15 degrees C. The ratio of prey to predator size was on average 87%, but the smallest observed size difference was only 1.3%. The intensity of cannibalistic attacks depended on water temperature with more intense cannibalism at 22 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, and no cannibalism at 10 degrees C. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in all three sagittal otolith size parameters (area, width, and length) was higher in prey than in cannibals, the differences were not statistically significant.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000542631300013

We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1545-7885			WOS:000431480000036	29608559

Historically, the theory associated with population cycles was tightly linked to pairwise consumer-resource interactions and studied via deterministic models, but current empirical and theoretical research reveals a much richer basis for ecological cycles. Stochasticity and seasonality can modulate or create cyclic behaviour in non-intuitive ways, the high-dimensionality in ecological systems can profoundly influence cycling, and so can demographic structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics. An inclusive theory for population cycles, ranging from ecosystem-level to demographic modelling, grounded in observational or experimental data, is therefore necessary to better understand observed cyclical patterns. In turn, by gaining better insight into the drivers of population cycles, we can begin to understand the causes of cycle gain and loss, how biodiversity interacts with population cycling, and how to effectively manage wildly fluctuating populations, all of which are growing domains of ecological research.									32	0	0	0	30	0	32			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000405917500015	28633194

The consequences of these abrupt changes in the outcomes of predator-prey interactions are unknown. Here, we tested the effects of a heat wave and a turbidity pulse on the foraging success of a subtropical cichlid fish (Gymnogeophagus terrapurpura) on amphipods (Hyalella curvispina). We carried out a short-term experiment combining treatments of turbidity (3 and 100 nephelometric turbidity units [NTU]) and water temperature (19.2, 22.2, 25.2 and 27.0 degrees C), considering potential differences given by fish length. Changes in water temperature did not promote significant changes in prey consumption. Higher turbidity, in contrast, decreased prey consumption. Also, we found that fish with different body lengths consumed a similar amount of prey under clear waters, but, in turbid waters, bigger individuals were more efficient than the smaller individuals. This finding is an empirical demonstration that the effect of increased turbidity on predation rate depends upon predator body size, and it suggests that bigger body sizes may help overcome turbidity-associated limitations in finding and capturing prey. Our short-term results suggest that, if turbidity pulses and heat waves become more frequent in the future, the outcome of fish-invertebrate interaction can be affected by local characteristics such as fish population size distribution.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3				2073-4441		WOS:000495598400153		
J	Su, TY; Mulla, MS								Toxicity and effects of microbial mosquito larvicides and larvicidal oil on the development and fecundity of the tadpole shrimp Triops newberryi (Packard) (Notostraca : Triopsidae)								JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY				30	1			107	114						JUN 2005	2005	Tadpole shrimp (TPS), Triops newberriy (Packard) (Notostraca: Triopsidae), is a predatory agent for immature mosquitoes breeding in aquatic habitats. This biological control agent could be used with other larvicides in mosquito control programs. In order to elucidate compatibility of the TPS and commonly used mosquito larvicides, studies were initiated to investigate effects of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. israelensis (B. t. i.) de Barjac, Bacillus sphaericus Neide and Golden Bear-1111 (R) larvicidal oil on growth, longevity, and fecundity of TPS in laboratory and field. The exposure of TPS to high dosages of B.t.i. and B. sphaericus in the laboratory or in the field did not have significant adverse effects on growth, longevity, and fecundity. These results indicate that TPS are compatible with microbial larvicides and can be used jointly in practical mosquito control programs. The larvicidal oil GB-1111 (R), on the other hand, caused almost 100% mortality within 48 h after treatment in the laboratory even at the low dosage of 0.38 gallons/ac. The impact of oil in the field was less severe, as significant adverse impact on population density was noted at 1 gallon/ac when water temperatures were warmer, or 2 gallons/ac when water temperatures were cooler. Almost 100% mortality within 48 h was noted at 2 gallons/ac when water temperatures were warmer or at 4 gallons/ac when the water temperatures were cooler. These results indicate incompatibility between this larvicidal oil and TPS at the higher rates of the label range, and joint use of TPS and larvicidal oil at dosages of 1-2 gallons/ac or greater, depending on water temperatures, should be avoided.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			1081-1710	1948-7134		WOS:000230216500015	16007963

Numerical models allow water managers to evaluate the combined effects of climate and water management on the biogeochemical processes thereby identifying opportunities to optimize water management to protect ecosystem function, biodiversity and associated services. We used a 3D hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with an aquatic ecosystem dynamic model (CAEDYM) to compare two scenarios across three climatic and hydrologic conditions (extreme wet, extreme dry and average) for Deadwood Reservoir (USA). Additionally, we collected water temperature, water chemistry and biological data from the reservoir and inflowing tributaries to validate the model, as well as migration and growth data from Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) the top predator of the food web. Modeled scenarios identified that reducing minimum outflows from 1.4 to 0.06 m(3) s(-1) during the fall and winter months resulted in higher reservoir elevations and cooler water temperatures the following year, which extended reservoir rearing during the summer and fall seasons. The scenarios with reduced stream flow during the fall and winter seasons indicate benefits to the reservoir ecosystem, particularly during dry years, and could reduce the effects of climatic warming.									3	2	0	0	4	0	5			1015-1621	1420-9055		WOS:000410781000013

Global warming is now affecting the thermal and hydrological regimes of rivers, compounding the threat and complicating conservation planning. To inform management under a non-stationary climate, we must improve our understanding of how flow and thermal regimes interact to affect the population dynamics of riverine biota. We used long-term growth biochronologies, spanning 34 years and 400,000 km(2), to model the growth dynamics of a long-lived, apex predator (Murray cod) as a function of factors extrinsic (river discharge; air temperature; sub-catchment) and intrinsic (age; individual) to the population. Annual growth of Murray cod showed significant, curvilinear, life-stage-specific responses to an interaction between annual discharge and temperature. Growth of early juveniles (age 1+ and 2+ years) exhibited a unimodal relationship with annual discharge, peaking near median annual discharge. Growth of late juveniles (3+ to 5+) and adults (>5+) increased with annual discharge, with the rate of increase being particularly high in adults, whose growth peaked during years with flooding. Years with very low annual discharge, as experienced during drought and under high abstraction, suppress growth rates of all Murray cod life-stages. Unimodal relationships between growth and annual temperature were evident across all life stages. Contrary to expectations of the Temperature Size Rule, the annual air temperature at which maximum growth occurred increased with age. The stage-specific response of Murray cod to annual discharge indicates that no single magnitude of annual discharge is optimal for cod populations, adding further weight to the case for maintaining and/or restoring flow variability in riverine ecosystems. With respect to climate change impacts, on balance our results indicate that the primary mechanism by which climate change threatens Murray cod growth is through alteration of river flows, not through warming annual mean temperatures per se.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000577718500001	32970901

While each stressor in isolation has been studied extensively, there has been less focus on their combined effects, which could impact key ecological processes. We tested the independent and combined effects of short-term exposure to elevated CO2 and temperature on the predator-prey interactions of a common pair of coral reef fishes (Pomacentrus wardi and its predator, Pseudochromis fuscus). We found that predator success increased following independent exposure to high temperature and elevated CO2. Overall, high temperature had an overwhelming effect on the escape behaviour of the prey compared with the combined exposure to elevated CO2 and high temperature or the independent effect of elevated CO2. Exposure to high temperatures led to an increase in attack and predation rates. By contrast, we observed little influence of elevated CO2 on the behaviour of the predator, suggesting that the attack behaviour of P. fuscus was robust to this environmental change. This is the first study to address how the kinematics and swimming performance at the basis of predator-prey interactions may change in response to concurrent exposure to elevated CO2 and high temperatures and represents an important step to forecasting the responses of interacting species to climate change.									15	1	0	0	13	0	16			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000405955900013	28659450

Modification of predator behaviour via ocean warming has been assessed by laboratory experimentation and metabolic theory. However, the influence of ocean acidification with ocean warming remains largely unexplored for mesopredators, including experimental assessments that incorporate key components of the assemblages in which animals naturally live. We employ a combination of long-term laboratory and mesocosm experiments containing natural prey and habitat to assess how warming and acidification affect the development, growth, and hunting behaviour in sharks. Although embryonic development was faster due to temperature, elevated temperature and CO2 had detrimental effects on sharks by not only increasing energetic demands, but also by decreasing metabolic efficiency and reducing their ability to locate food through olfaction. The combination of these effects led to considerable reductions in growth rates of sharks held in natural mesocosms with elevated CO2, either alone or in combination with higher temperature. Our results suggest a more complex reality for predators, where ocean acidification reduces their ability to effectively hunt and exert strong top-down control over food webs.									58	1	0	0	52	0	59			2045-2322			WOS:000364451400001	26559327

One recovery strategy is to restore tidal wetlands, thereby increasing productivity and prey abundance. However, the link between tidal wetlands and foraging of delta smelt is not yet established. Using GIS, we quantified the area of tidal wetlands (km(2)) within a 2-km radius around sampling stations from which 1380 delta smelt were collected over 4years (2011-2015). We quantified stomach fullness, a metric of foraging success, for each fish and regressed it against tidal wetland area, turbidity, water temperature, and other factors known to influence foraging success of delta smelt. Stomach fullness increased with both increasing tidal wetland area and increasing water temperature and was reduced at turbidities >80NTU. Model estimates show that stomach fullness increased twofold from the minimum (0km(2)) to the maximum (4.89km(2)) tidal wetland area. Of this increase, 60% was due to increased predation on larval fish, while 40% was due to increased predation on zooplankton. Delta smelt collected from areas with the highest tidal wetland area were six times more likely to have a larval fish in their guts than those collected from areas with the lowest. Thus, tidal wetland appears to confer substantial benefits to the foraging success of delta smelt, mainly via increased predation on larval fish.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000463827200019

The effects of temperature and food concentration on the fitness of Daphnia magna were tested in a 4 x 4 factorial flow-through design. Food ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mg C L (-1) and temperature ranged from 15 to 30 degreesC.2. The juvenile growth rate (g(j)) was used to construct reaction norms for temperature at varying food concentrations. Two clones isolated from the same pond at different seasons did not differ with respect to their temperature responses. Reaction norms had the shape of an optimum curve with highest values around 20 degreesC. There was a significant temperature-food interaction as the temperature response was most pronounced when the food was not limiting.3. Differences in fitness were a consequence of different responses of physiological parameters to food and temperature. Age and size at first reproduction, as well as egg numbers, decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing food concentration.4. As the temperature effect was strongest at the highest food concentrations, it can be concluded that environmental warming may affect D. magna more through a temperature rise earlier in spring rather than in summer.									100	3	0	0	97	1	105			0046-5070			WOS:000167734100001		
J	RASMUSSEN, T; TANDE, K								TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT, GROWTH AND MORTALITY IN LARVAE OF THE DEEP-WATER PRAWN PANDALUS-BOREALIS REARED IN THE LABORATORY								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				118	1-3			149	157		10.3354/meps118149				MAR 1995	1995	As part of investigations on how increase in temperature affects development, growth and survival in crustaceans, larval biology of the deep-water prawn Pandalus borealis from 2 northern Norwegian fjords was studied. Larvae were maintained in individual glass jars for 60 d in the laboratory with ad libitum food conditions under 4 different temperature regimes. Two cohorts of larvae from the Malangen fjord were introduced to 4.2 degrees C; one ('Malacon') was kept at this temperature and the other ('Malainc') was subjected to a temperature increase of 0.03 degrees C d(-1). Two cohorts from Balsfjorden were introduced to 2.5 degrees C; one ('Balscon') was kept at this temperature and the other ('Balsinc') was subjected to a temperature increase of 0.04 degrees C d(-1). In Balscon, development was clearly arrested from the second zoeal stage (ZII), and only a few individuals moulted to ZIII around Day 50. ZVI occurred at Day 60 in Balsinc and Malainc. Stage durations varied in all groups, but stage duration tended to decrease from ZIII to ZV. There was no significant difference in dry weight between the groups before Day 30. Thereafter, growth was more rapid in the regimes with increasing temperature. There was a clear effect of temperature on mortality. Higher mortalities occurred in the 2 groups held at constant temperatures; under increasing temperatures mortality was low during the entire period. Thus, a high rate of temperature increase favours survival in zoeal stages of P. borealis, more than a constant high temperature. Survival was higher in Balsinc than in Malainc, but this was partly counteracted by a longer period to reach settling as juveniles. These results indicate that, given the same predation regime, the overall survival from hatching to settling would be in the same order of magnitude in the ambient temperature regimes during spring 1991 in both Balsfjorden and Malangen.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1995QP42600014

Our results suggest that temperature is the driving force behind the observed seasonality (almost 2-fold) in Cs-137 concentrations in fish. Although faster clearance is largely responsible for the observed decline in Cs-137 concentrations at peak water temperatures, ration and growth also contribute. Ration is best modeled as the first derivative of a Gaussian representation of the annual water temperature cycle (producing a bimodal pattern with a minimum at the peak of the summer), whereas growth appears to be a direct function of the temperature curve. This pattern was consistent with ration estimated from gut contents and clearance rates. The model was developed with data from Centrarchids and further testing with other fish taxa is necessary to confirm the generality of these results.

The consequences of competitive interactions between the Nile tilapia (interference competitor) and common carp (exploitative competitor) were investigated here across a temperature gradient (20-28A degrees C). These highly invasive fish are now present in many regions where populations increasingly coexist, inducing trophic interactions and niche overlaps. Experimental feeding and growth trials revealed the feeding rate (items s(-1)) and specific growth rate (% day(-1)) of these fishes were not significantly different at 24A degrees C, but were significantly higher for . at 20A degrees C and significantly higher for . at 28A degrees C. An additional experiment completed at 24A degrees C revealed that . rapidly form hierarchies, where dominant fish monopolise food resources through interference, resulting in their faster growth. Introductions of 1 and 3 . (an exploitative competitor) into the hierarchy had no effect on this food monopolisation as carp were excluded through aggression. The addition of 6 . did, however, significantly reduce the food intake of the dominant tilapia. This was due to increased exploitative competition rather than breaking of the hierarchy. The effect of adding 3 . was similar to 6 , suggesting inter- and intra-specific competitive strength was similar. These findings suggest when populations co-exist, temperature-dependent feeding interactions may result in the competitive exclusion of . through the aggressive interference by . , potentially influencing invasion outcomes.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000303894300009		
J	Keller, AA; Klein-MacPhee, G								Impact of elevated temperature on the growth, survival, and trophic dynamics of winter flounder larvae: a mesocosm study								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				57	12			2382	2392		10.1139/cjfas-57-12-2382				DEC 2000	2000	Winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) is a dominant commercial fish in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and yet factors controlling its recruitment remain unclear. An experiment was conducted with six 13-m(3) land-based mesocosms (5 m deep) from February to April 1997 to address the impact of increased temperature (+3 degreesC) on growth, survival, and trophic dynamics of winter flounder larvae. Objectives were to determine if warmer winter temperatures result in lower survival of winter flounder as a result of increased predator activity or if temperature-induced alterations in the food web result in greater food availability, perhaps leading to increased survival. Analyses of variance revealed significant (P < 0.05) or near-significant (P < 0.10) differences in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and biomass between warm and cool mesocosms. Winter flounder egg survival, percent hatch, time to hatch, and initial size were significantly greater in cool systems (P < 0.05). Mortality rates were lower in cool systems and significantly related to the abundance of active predators (P < 0.05). The cumulative impact of decreased survival of eggs and larvae in warm systems may partially explain the decline of winter flounder in Narragansett Bay, which has experienced elevated winter water temperatures in recent years.									34	0	0	0	32	0	34			0706-652X			WOS:000166196700005

Most arctic lakes are characterised by a long period (8-10 months) of ice-cover, cold water and low algal biomass. The water temperature and nutrient concentrations, and most probably the nutrient input from the catchments, are closely related to the duration of snow- and ice-cover in the takes. In years when the ice-out is late,-that is, in late July,-phytoplankton photosynthesis is limited by the lack of light and nutrients. Less food is then available to the next link in the food chain, such as copepods and daphnids, with implication on their growth rates.A more maritime climate has been predicted for Northeast Greenland, and an increasing duration of the ice-free period has been observed during the last decade in the lakes at Zackenberg. If this continues, it may result in lower food availability to the top predator of the lakes, the arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus. The results obtained so far indicate that despite the often low abundance of arctic charr, it has a strong regulating impact on the composition and density of the zooplankton community and the abundance of the arctic tadpole shrimp, Lepidurus arcticus, which likely regulates the density of benthic cladocerans.									32	1	0	0	29	0	33			0065-2504			WOS:000256528000016

Several studies have indicated that food availability may influence body condition and in doing so, affect the production of alarm cues. We examined whether food availability (high and low) and temperature (27, 30 and 32 A degrees C) interacted to affect the production of chemical alarm cues by juveniles of a marine tropical prey fish, Pomacentrus moluccensis. Results indicate that poorly-fed fish had depleted energy reserves with rising temperatures compared to well-fed fish. Fish with a poor feeding history also showed depressed growth rate across all temperature treatments. The alarm cues produced by experimental fish triggered stronger antipredator responses as temperature increased up to 30 A degrees C, regardless of the feeding history or body condition of the donor. However, at 32 A degrees C, alarm cues from poorly-fed fish did not elicit as effectively an antipredator response in conspecifics compared to those produced by well-fed fish. The results highlight that warming oceans, in isolation but also in conjunction with changes in food supply, may have a drastic impact on chemically-mediated predator-prey interactions.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000383126700003		
J	Pockl, M; Webb, BW; Sutcliffe, DW								Life history and reproductive capacity of Gammarus fossarum and G-roeseli (Crustacea : Amphipoda) under naturally fluctuating water temperatures: a simulation study								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				48	1			53	66		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00967.x				JAN 2003	2003	1. Mathematical functions developed in long-term laboratory experiments at different constant temperatures were combined with daily water temperatures for 1991 - 93 in eight Austrian streams and rivers to simulate the complex life histories and reproductive capacities of two freshwater amphipods: Gammarus fossarum and G. roeseli. The functions describe brood development times, hatching success, times taken to reach sexual maturity, growth, and fecundity. The sex ratio was assumed to be 0.5 and an autumn - winter reproductive resting period was based on observations of six river populations. Simulations included summer-cold mountain streams, summer-warm lowland rivers, watercourses fed by groundwater or influenced by heated effluents, and varying amplitudes of change within each year.2. A FORTRAN 77 computer program calculated growth from birth to sexual maturity of first-generation females born on the first day of each calendar month in 1991, and the numbers of offspring successfully released from the maternal broodpouch in successive broods. At the 1991 - 93 regimes of temperature, individual G. fossarum released 127 - 208 offspring and G. roeseli released 120 - 169 in seven or eight successive broods during life spans of less than 2 years in six rivers. Life spans extended into a third year in the relatively cool River Salzach (mean temperature 7.5 degreesC). They were not completed in the very cold River Steyr (mean 5.6, range 2.5 - 7.9 degreesC), where G. fossarum produced five broods ( totalling 120 offspring) and G. roeseli only two broods ( totalling 28 offspring) in the 3-year period. Except in the Steyr, some offspring grew rapidly to maturity and produced several second-generation broods during the simulation period; in the warmest rivers some third-generation broods were also produced. Birth dates, early or late in the year, influenced the subsequent production of broods and young, depending on temperature regimes in particular rivers. Total numbers of offspring produced by the second and third generations represent the theoretical reproductive capacities of G. fossarum and G. roeseli. Minimum and maximum estimates mostly ranged from 100 to 17 300, were larger for G. fossarum except in the warmest river ( March), where temperatures rose above 20 degreesC for 56-78 days in summer, and largest ( maximum 37 600) in the River Voeckla heated by discharge from a power-station (mean 11.5 degreesC). Results from the simulations agree with preliminary assessments of relative abundances for G. fossarum and G. roeseli in several of the study rivers, but in some one or both species appear to be absent. On a wider scale, the present study confirms that G. fossarum is potentially more successful than G. roeseli in cool rivers but indicates that neither species is likely to maintain viable populations in cold rivers strongly influenced by snow and ice-melt.3. The potential impacts of future river warming by increases of 1, 2 and 3 degreesC, due to climate change, vary according to river site, date of fertilisation, the extent of temperature increase, and the species of Gammarus. For Austrian rivers with mean temperatures in the range c. 7 - 10 degreesC, future warming would result in modest changes in the life histories and reproductive capacities of both G. fossarum and G. roeseli; the former would find improved temperature conditions in watercourses that are currently very cold throughout the year, and both would find warm rivers less tolerable.4. The high potential reproductive capacity of gammarids, with rapid production of numerous successive broods when sexual maturity is finally achieved, indicates adaptation to high mortality during the relatively long period of growth to sexual maturity, and provides scope for an opportunistic strategy of emigration from centres of population abundance to colonise new territory when conditions are favourable. Rapid expansion of populations is desirable to combat the effects of environmental catastrophes, both frequent and short-term floods and droughts, and more long-term climatic changes that have occurred several times in glacial - interglacial periods during the current Ice Age.									57	0	1	0	55	0	63			0046-5070			WOS:000179693900005

An empirical approach evaluating reef fish trophic interactions								MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH				138				19	27		10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.03.013				JUL 2018	2018	Understanding how invasive species affect key ecological interactions and ecosystem processes is imperative for the management of invasions. We evaluated the effects of invasive corals (Tubastraea spp.) on fish trophic interactions in an Atlantic coral reef. Remote underwater video cameras were used to examine fish foraging activity (bite rates and food preferences) on invasive cover levels. Using a model selection approach, we found that fish feeding rates declined with increased invasive cover. For Roving Herbivores (RH) and Sessile Invertivores (SI), an abrupt reduction of fish feeding rates corresponded with higher invasive cover, while feeding rates of Territorial Herbivores (TH) and Mobile Invertivores (MI) decreased linearly with cover increase. Additionally, some fish trophic groups, such as RH, SI and Omnivores (OM), had lower densities in reef sections with high invasive cover. These findings demonstrate that invasive corals negatively impact fish-benthic interactions, and could potentially alter existing trophic relationships in reef ecosystems.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			0141-1136	1879-0291		WOS:000434748700003	29627113

Impacts of predator-induced behavioural plasticity on the temperature dependence of predator-prey activity and population dynamics								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY											10.1111/1365-2656.13383		NOV 2020			2020	Predation is a key ecological interaction affecting populations and communities. Climate warming can modify this interaction both directly by the kinetic effects of temperature on biological rates and indirectly through integrated behavioural and physiological responses of the predators and prey. Temperature dependence of predation rates can further be altered by predator-induced plasticity of prey locomotor activity, but empirical data about this effect are lacking.We propose a general framework to understand the influence of predator-induced developmental plasticity on behavioural thermal reaction norms in prey and their consequences for predator-prey dynamics. Using a mesocosm experiment with dragonfly larvae (predator) and newt larvae (prey), we tested if the predator-induced plasticity alters the elevation or the slope of the thermal reaction norms for locomotor activity metrics in prey. We also estimated the joint predator-prey thermal response in mean locomotor speed, which determines prey encounter rate, and modelled the effect of both phenomena on predator-prey population dynamics.Thermal reaction norms for locomotor activity in prey were affected by predation risk cues but with minor influence on the joint predator-prey behavioural response. We found that predation risk cues significantly decreased the intercept of thermal reaction norm for total activity rate (i.e. all body movements) but not the other locomotor activity metrics in the prey, and that prey locomotor activity rate and locomotor speed increased with prey density.Temperature had opposite effects on the mean relative speed of predator and prey as individual speed increased with temperature in predators but decreased in prey. This led to a negligible effect of body temperature on predicted prey encounter rates and predator-prey dynamics. The behavioural component of predator-prey interaction varied much more between individuals than with temperature and the presence of predation risk cues in our system.We conclude that within-population variation in locomotor activity can buffer the influence of body temperature and predation risk cues on predator-prey interactions, and further research should focus on the magnitude and sources of behavioural variation in interacting species to predict the impact of climate change on predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000590992000001	33159686

The study results indicated that the growth rates of HNF showed pronounced seasonal variation (-0.37-1.25 d(-1)), reaching the maximum during spring to early summer. When the water temperature was higher than 25.5 degreesC, HNF growth was inversely proportional to water temperature. There was an effect by bacterial abundance and autotrophic picoplankton on HNF growth that depended on location. HNF biomass was the highest in late spring, and the HNF production ranged from -2.25 to 35.45 mg l(-1) d(-1) with mean of 3.17 mg l(-1) d(-1). When considered in the context of biomass and production data for zooplankton in Lake Donghu, it was evident that HNF contributed significantly to the total zooplankton production in Lake Donghu. These in situ studies indicate that temperature and food supply are the major determinants of HNF abundance and productivity.									9	1	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000186041600002

In this study we investigated the long term effects of a range of temperatures on shell morphology of the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, a highly invasive species and an important pest of rice. Analysis of shells using geometric morphometrics showed that the main source of morphological variation was allometry, which was detected in males but not in females. This intersexual divergence in allometric trajectories generates much of the morphological variation evidenced. In females, the monotonic relationship with temperature produced narrower shells in the snails reared at lower temperatures, and more expanded apertures, relatively bigger than the body whorl, at higher temperatures. We also found an inverse relationship between relative shell weight, a proxy for shell thickness, and temperature. The differences in shape and relative shell weight are attributable to the different growth rates associated with different temperatures. Temperature fluctuation around a mean of 23.2 degrees C seemed to have no influence in shell shape and relative weight when is compared with a constant temperature of 25 degrees C. Information on the influence of temperature on freshwater snails is important for understanding and predicting changes in the face of global climatic change, especially in traits exhibiting great plasticity, such as shell shape and thickness. This work showed that higher temperatures could result in a relatively thinner shell, implying a greater significance of corrosion in flowing waters and a lower resistance to crushing by predators, especially in low latitude areas.									3	0	0	0	3	0	4			0306-4565			WOS:000436526200043	29801646

They use their reticulopodia to gather sediment with associated algae, organic detritus, and bacteria. Uptake of diatoms by foraminifera have been observed but rarely quantified. We measured the clearance (gathering) rate and ingestion rate of diatoms by the common benthic foraminifer Quinqueloculina seminula using Nitzschia closterium as prey under laboratory culture conditions. Grazing experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of temperature (at 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 degrees C) and food availability (10 to 800 cells mm(-2)) on uptake rates of diatoms. The clearance rates, estimated from the disappearance of food items, were variable (0.59-4.4 mm(2) foram(-1) h(-1)) and did not show a clear relationship with food availability. The maximum clearance rates increased from 1.80 +/- 0.21 to 2.69 +/- 0.32 mm(2) foram(-1) h(-1) when temperature increased from 12 to 18 degrees C and decreased to 2.28 +/- 0.25 mm(2) foram(-1) h(-1) at 24 degrees C. Ingestion rates varied from 1.0 to 43 x 10(3) diatoms foram(-1) h(-1), following a hyperbolic response to food concentrations at all experimental temperatures. The maximum individual ingestion rates increased from 842 +/- 180 to 1648 +/- 480 (mean +/- SE) cells foram(-1) h(-1) and then decreased to 316 +/- 54 cells foram(-1) h(-1) as temperature increased from 12 to 24 degrees C. Experimental results revealed that 12-18 degrees C was the optimal temperature range for Q. seminula feeding for specimens adapted to local conditions. Our study indicates that Q. seminula plays an ecological role by feeding upon benthic diatoms in marine benthic ecosystems.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0096-1191			WOS:000457207500002		
J	McQueen, Kate; Marshall, C. Tara								Shifts in spawning phenology of cod linked to rising sea temperatures								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				74	6			1561	1573		10.1093/icesjms/fsx025				JUL-AUG 2017	2017	Warming temperatures caused by climate change have the potential to impact spawning phenology of temperate marine fish as some species have temperature-dependent gonadal development. Inter-annual variation in the timing of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) spawning in the northern North Sea, central North Sea and Irish Sea was estimated by calculating an annual peak roe month (PRM) from records of roe landings spanning the last three decades. A trend towards earlier PRM was found in all three regions, with estimates of shifts in PRM ranging from 0.9 to 2.4 weeks per decade. Temperatures experienced by cod during early vitellogenesis correlated negatively with PRM, suggesting that rising sea temperatures have contributed to a shift in spawning phenology. A concurrent reduction in the mean size of spawning females excluded the possibility that earlier spawning was due to a shift in size structure towards larger individuals, as large cod spawn earlier than smaller-sized individuals in the North Sea. Further research into the effects of climate change on the phenology of different trophic levels within the North Sea ecosystem should be undertaken to determine whether climate change-induced shifts in spawning phenology will result in a temporal mismatch between cod larvae and their planktonic prey.									11	0	0	0	12	0	12			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000406598500008

We used a combination of laboratory and field approaches to study the thermal biology of bonefish, Albula vulpes, a fish species that relies on nearshore intertidal habitats throughout the Caribbean. The critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for bonefish was determined to be 36.4 +/- 0.5 and 37.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C for fish acclimated to 27.3 +/- 1.3 and 30.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C, respectively, and these tolerances are below maximal temperatures recorded in the tropical tidal habitats where bonefish frequently reside (i.e., up to 40.6 degrees C). In addition, daily temperatures can fluctuate up to 11.4 degrees C over a 24-h period emphasizing the dramatic range of temperatures that could be experienced by bonefish on a diel basis. Use of an acoustic telemetry array to monitor bonefish movements coupled with hourly temperature data collected within tidal creeks revealed a significant positive relationship between the amount of time bonefish spent in the upper portions of the creeks with the increasing maximal water temperature. This behavior is likely in response to feeding requirements necessary to fuel elevated metabolic demands when water temperatures generally warm, and also to avoid predators. For fish held in the laboratory, reaching CTMax temperatures elicited a secondary stress response that included an increase in blood lactate, glucose, and potassium levels. A field study that involved exposing fish to a standardized handling stressor at temperatures approaching their CTMax generated severe physiological disturbances relative to fish exposed to the same stressor at cooler temperatures. In addition, evaluation of the short-term survival of bonefish after surgical implantation of telemetry tags revealed that there was a positive relationship between water temperature at time of tagging and mortality. Collectively, the data from these laboratory and field studies suggest that bonefish occupy habitats that approach their laboratory-determined CTMax and can apparently do so without significant sub-lethal physiological consequences or mortality, except when exposed to additional stressors.

J	Driscoll, Ryan M.; Reiss, Christian S.; Hentschel, Brian T.								Temperature-dependent growth of Thysanoessa macrura: inter-annual and spatial variability around Elephant Island, Antarctica								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				529				49	61		10.3354/meps11291				JUN 8 2015	2015	Somatic growth of pelagic invertebrates is controlled by temperature and food, both of which vary in space and time. Species-specific growth rate responses to environmental variability may affect populations through changes in reproductive potential; therefore, measuring spatial and temporal variability in growth rates of highly abundant zooplankton is critical to predict the impact of climate change on pelagic ecosystems. Here, we used length frequencies from bi-annual surveys conducted 1 month apart to estimate growth rates of one the most abundant euphausiids in the Southern Ocean, Thysanoessa macrura. We analyzed summer data from 4 separate years (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) that varied widely in temperature and primary production. Stations within the surveys were grouped by water characteristics: warm, low salinity Antarctic Circum polar Current (ACC) water, and cold, saline Bransfield Strait and Weddell Sea (MBW) water, to assess inter-annual and spatial variability in cohort growth. Mid-summer cohort growth rates of T. macrura varied between years and water masses, ranging from -0.037 mm d(-1) in MBW water in 2004 to 0.081 mm d(-1) in ACC water in 1995. Growth rates were faster in ACC water than in MBW water during all years. Growth rates were strongly correlated with temperature (R-2 = 0.82) but weakly correlated with copepod density (R-2 = 0.38), and were not correlated with chl a concentration (R-2 = 0.11). These results suggest that the growth rates of T. macrura may increase in regions exhibiting warming trends, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. This contrasts with published data on the growth rates of Euphausia superba, which is predicted to be impacted negatively by climate warming.									6	0	0	0	6	0	7			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000356076000004

Recent data suggest that estrogenic exposure and rising ambient temperatures independently impact predator-prey relationships. However, establishing these connections in natural settings is complex. These obstacles can be circumvented if biomarkers of estrogenic exposure in resident fish can predict changes in predator-prey relationships. To test the effects of estrone and temperature, the piscivore bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) was exposed for 30 days to estrone at concentrations (90 +/- 17.6 ng/L [mean +/- standard deviation] and 414 +/- 146 ng/L) previously shown to reduce prey-capture success. Exposures were conducted at four temperatures (15 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C) to simulate breeding season ambient temperatures across the natural range of this species. A suite of morphological and physiological biomarkers previously linked to estrogenic exposures were examined. Biomarkers of estrone exposure were more commonly and severely impacted in male fish than in female fish. Notably, the gonadosomatic index was lower and gonads were less mature in exposed males. Additionally, temperature modulated the effects of estrone similarly in males and females with fish exposed at higher temperatures typically exhibiting a decreased morphological index. This study provides evidence that alterations in hepatic function and gonadal function may cause shifts in metabolism and energy allocation that may lead to declining prey capture performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-4341	1432-0703		WOS:000524647000001	32266455

Recent evidence suggests that both increased water temperature and elevated levels of dissolved CO2 can change the behaviors of fishes in ways that reduce individual fitness, however the interacting effects of these variables are unknown. We used a fully factorial experiment to test the independent and interactive effects of temperature (3 levels: 28.5, 30, and 31.5 degrees C) and pCO(2) (3 levels: averaging 420, 530, and 960 mu atm) on food consumption and activity level of juvenile anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus (Bleeker 1852). Experimental levels were consistent with current-day ocean conditions and predictions for mid-century and late-century based on atmospheric CO2 projections. Sibling fish were reared for 21 days from the end of their larval phase in each of the nine treatments, at which time behavioral observations were conducted. Food consumption and foraging activity decreased at the highest temperature. In isolation, CO2 level did not significantly affect behavior; however, there was an interaction with temperature. While rearing at high temperature (31.5 degrees C) and control (420 mu atm) or moderate (530 mu atm) CO2 resulted in a reduction of food consumption and foraging activity, rearing at high temperature and high CO2 (960 mu atm) resulted in an elevation in these behaviors. Maintaining food consumption and foraging activity in high temperature and CO2 conditions may reduce energy efficiency if the thermal optimum for food assimilation and growth has been exceeded. Maintaining foraging effort might increase predation vulnerability. These results suggest that changes in foraging behaviors caused by the interactive effects of increased SST and CO2 could have significant effects on the growth and survival of juvenile reef fishes by late century.

Focusing on physical habitat features ignores other habitat components, such as an adequate food supply, that limit the amount of energy available for growth and survival. We tested the degree that food availability and temperature influence lotic salmonid consumption and growth rates and outline an approach for assessing habitat quality based on measurements of these features. We collected benthic and drifting invertebrate abundances, stream temperatures, and juvenile steelhead - rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) summer growth rates among nine stream segments in central Oregon. Stream temperatures and growth rates were used in bioenergetics model simulations to estimate O. mykiss consumption rates. The variation in O. mykiss consumption rates was explained by measurements of total drift biomass along a type II predator response curve (R-2 = 0.71). This simplified foraging relationship between food abundance and consumption is then used to estimate the consumption component of the bioenergetics model to allow estimation of salmonid growth potential. Validation of the growth potential model produced reasonably accurate estimates of fish growth rates at reaches within the study area and precise but biased estimates in novel systems. While additional reach-level habitat information may be required to make the model more generalizable, the assessment of invertebrate food availability offers a simple yet powerful approach for describing the growth potential of stream habitat.									25	0	0	0	26	0	26			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000341517800004		
J	Cheng, Brian S.; Komoroske, Lisa M.; Grosholz, Edwin D.					Cheng, Brian/0000-0003-1679-8398			Trophic sensitivity of invasive predator and native prey interactions: integrating environmental context and climate change								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				31	3			642	652		10.1111/1365-2435.12759				MAR 2017	2017	Climate change is predicted to intensify the impacts of invasive species by enhancing their performance relative to their native counterparts. However, few studies have compared the performance of invasive predators and native prey, despite the fact that non-native predators are well known to disrupt native communities. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis' suggests that predators are less tolerant of increasing environmental stress than their prey, whereas the tolerant invaders hypothesis' suggests that invaders are more tolerant than native species due to selection during the introduction process. It is therefore unclear how invasive predators will respond to increasing climate stressors. We coupled physiological measurements (thermal tolerance, thermal optima, salinity tolerance, predation rate) with environmental time-series data to assess the effects of warming and extreme low salinity events on non-native predators (gastropods) and native prey (oysters) from a coastal ecosystem. In general support of the trophic sensitivity hypothesis, we found that both non-native predators exhibited lower thermal optima relative to native prey, lower salinity tolerance and one predator was less tolerant of warming. However, because warming tolerance was extremely high (i.e. habitat temperature is 79-21 degrees C below thermal tolerance), near-term warming may first increase predator performance (consumption and growth rates), with negative effects on prey. Low salinity will likely produce heterogeneous effects on predator-prey interactions due to varying watershed sizes among estuaries that control the duration of low salinity events. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis may be a useful framework for understanding community responses to extreme climate change, which portends a decoupling of predator-prey interactions. However, we conclude that this hypothesis must be evaluated in environmental context and that coupling physiological metrics with insitu environmental data offers the best predictive power of near-term climate change impacts on invaded communities. Within our study system, warming is likely to intensify the impacts of both invasive predators, which may greatly reduce the abundance of the native oyster, a species of conservation and restoration focus.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000395347300010

The study of the long-term variation in the composition of their communities was stimulated by recent dramatic changes in the abundance of some species. We review and evaluate possible effects of the main causes cited in the literature. Agricultural and habitat changes (particularly urbanization) affect coccinellid abundance, both negatively and positively. In the temperate zone dominant species occur most frequently associated with abundant prey populations on crops, weeds and planted stands of trees resulting from human activity. Invasive non-native species of coccinellids may endanger native species through intraguild predation or competition for resources, but their supposed serious negative effects on native species can differ considerably. Climatic change may influence coccinellid species in several ways, including indirect effects through lower trophic levels and desynchronisation of the phenologies of host plants, prey and coccinellid populations. In the near future we do not expect climate warming to have important effects on ladybird diversity globally, but local changes in the composition of coccinellid communities and abundance of particular species could occur.									23	0	0	0	19	0	25			2214-5745	2214-5753		WOS:000403060200012	28602237

The long-term viability of metapopulations is dependent on independent dynamics of local populations, because it mitigates fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole. Metapopulation viability will be compromised if climate change increases spatial synchrony in weather conditions associated with population growth rates. We studied a recently reported increase in metapopulation synchrony of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the Finnish archipelago, to see if it could be explained by an increase in synchrony of weather conditions. For this, we used 23years of butterfly survey data together with monthly weather records for the same period. We first examined the associations between population growth rates within different regions of the metapopulation and weather conditions during different life-history stages of the butterfly. We then examined the association between the trends in the synchrony of the weather conditions and the synchrony of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics. We found that precipitation from spring to late summer are associated with the M. cinxia per capita growth rate, with early summer conditions being most important. We further found that the increase in metapopulation synchrony is paralleled by an increase in the synchrony of weather conditions. Alternative explanations for spatial synchrony, such as increased dispersal or trophic interactions with a specialist parasitoid, did not show paralleled trends and are not supported. The climate driven increase in M. cinxia metapopulation synchrony suggests that climate change can increase extinction risk of spatially structured populations living in fragmented landscapes by altering their dynamics.									21	0	0	0	17	0	21			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000441746900035	29682866

Somatic growth rates were strongly correlated with seawater temperature. Both otolith growth and RNA/DNA ratios were correlated with somatic growth. Age at metamorphosis declined with increasing temperature, but there was no relationship between size at metamorphosis and temperature. Development seemed to be more related to temperature than to size. Large between-year differences were observed in the relationship between body size and otolith diameter. Otolith growth indices were used to compare back-calculated otolith growth between years or periods. In general growth was positively related to temperature, but early otolith growth was fastest at intermediate temperatures. It is proposed that the high temperature in 1989 had a negative effect on growth during the early larval stages, but a positive effect on the later stages.									94	2	0	0	86	1	96			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1991FA14600001

Detailed measurements were made on the population densities of Daphnia and Anisops spp., the amount of food available, the nutritional status, and the size-specific fecundity of Daphnia.The density of the Daphnia population at the field site oscillated closely with water temperature. The amplitude of the population fluctuations varied seasonally, being much greater during the warmer months of the year and switching to fluctuations with low peaks when water temperature dropped below approximately 15 degrees C. Anisops spp. densities were greatest in winter and declined during the spring of each year. Nymphs appeared in late spring and early summer and numerically dominated the population. During the warmer periods of the year, the daphnid population went through a series of rapid growth phases leading to over-exploitation of food resources and subsequent population collapses. Daphnia population densities were not correlated with Anisops numbers suggesting that predation was not a major regulatory factor during the warmer periods of the year. When water temperatures fell below ca. 15 degrees C daphnid population densities remained low despite high food levels. During this period the impact of Anisops may have been greater. Two distinct phases were identified: a warm water period when food limitation was the main regulatory factor, and a cool water period when Anisops predation may have been the paramount factor. Low oxygen concentrations were associated with heavy rainfall in the spring and may have had a limiting effect on Daphnia for short periods. Daphnia may have had an important role in sustaining the Anisops population in the pond over each winter.									17	1	0	0	14	0	18			0020-9309			WOS:000071243800008

This was not simply the result of occupying warmer microhabitats, because L. disjunctus larvae grew faster than C. resolutum at all constant temperatures between 10 and 25 degrees C in the laboratory. Multiple regression analysis showed that growth rates of both species were positively related to temperature and negatively related to larval size and to the square of temperature. The latter term is necessary to describe the decrease in growth rate at high temperatures. The equation predicted that the growth rate of L. disjunctus reached a maximum at 28.8 degrees C, whereas that of C. resolutum decreased above 22.4 degrees C. Small and medium-sized larvae of L. disjunctus ate more prey (Daphnia magna) in 15 min than C. resolutum at all prey densities. In 15-min experiments the attack coefficient for small L. disjunctus larvae was significantly larger than for small C. resolutum larvae and handling time for medium larvae was shorter. Other comparisons had large associated sampling errors, but the trends were the same. These differences may be associated with the relatively longer labia of L. disjunctus and its ability to change hunting methods from ambush to active search.									35	0	0	0	37	0	39			0008-4301			WOS:A1995TF32400012		
J	Buckley, L. J.; Lough, R. G.; Mountain, D.								Seasonal trends in mortality and growth of cod and haddock larvae result in an optimal window for survival								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				405				57	69		10.3354/meps08503				2010	2010	Changing climate and global depletion of fish stocks have added urgency to the century-old quest to understand the factors controlling fish production. The leading hypotheses advanced to explain the large (orders of magnitude) inter-annual variability in recruitment of young fish emphasize rapid growth and a match to prey production in the first weeks after hatching, although avoiding predators may be of equal or greater importance. Here we show for 2 important North Atlantic groundfish (Atlantic cod Gadus morhua and haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus) that seasonal patterns in growth (G) and mortality (M) rates of young larvae combine in some years to yield a window of opportunity when M falls below G within days after hatching and cohort biomass increases rapidly possibly leading to high recruitment. Contrary to expectations, this window occurs early in the seasonal production cycle (February to March) when temperatures are near their annual minimum, fish larvae and their prey are relatively scarce, and G is low. In most cases examined, later, faster-growing cohorts appear to be rapidly lost to a suite of vertebrate and invertebrate predators whose abundance, metabolism, and consumption increase through the spring with increasing water temperature. In this seasonally varying environment, size on year day may be critical to minimizing M/G. Our data demonstrate the importance of rapid growth throughout the season cycle, but particularly early in the season when temperatures, potential prey, and predators are at seasonal low levels. These findings reinforce the importance of management practices protecting larger, older females that begin spawning earlier in the season and produce larger, more viable eggs and larvae.									21	0	0	0	16	0	21			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000278041300005

Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.									43	0	0	0	38	0	45			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000278308100003

Here we discuss these impacts by drawing on examples from freshwater ecosystems, and argue that future research should quantify changes in such trophic interactions (i.e. the links in a food web), rather than simply focusing on traditional measures of diversity or abundance (i.e. the nodes in a food web). We conceptualise the impacts of invaders on trophic links as either direct consumption, indirect trophic effects (e.g. cascading interactions, competition) or indirect nontrophic effects (e.g. behaviour mediated). We then discuss how invader impacts on trophic links are context-dependent, varying with invader traits (e.g. feeding rates), abiotic variables (e.g. temperature, pH) and the traits of the receiving community (e.g. predators or competitors). Co-occurring invasive species and other environmental stressors, such as climate change, will also influence invader impacts on trophic links. Finally, we discuss the available methods to identify new food web interactions following invasion and to quantify how invasive species disrupt existing feeding links. Methods include direct observations in the field, laboratory trials (e.g. to quantify functional responses) and controlled mesocosm experiments to elucidate impacts on food webs. Field studies which use tracer techniques, such as stable isotope analyses, allow diet characterisation of both invaders and interacting native species in the wild. We conclude that invasive species often drastically alter food webs by creating and disrupting trophic links, and future research should be directed particularly towards disentangling the effects of invaders from other environmental stressors.									18	0	0	0	16	0	18			0065-2504		978-0-12-813329-3; 978-0-12-801431-8	WOS:000406858000003

It has been suggested that in fresh waters at high latitudes and altitudes, surface ice during winter functions as overhead cover for fish, reducing the predation risk from terrestrial piscivores. We simulated ice cover by suspending plastic sheeting over five 30-m-long stream sections in a boreal forest stream and examined its effects on the growth and habitat use of brown trout (Salmo trutta) during winter. Trout that spent the winter under the artificial ice cover grew more than those in the control (uncovered) sections. Moreover, tracking of trout tagged with passive integrated transponders showed that in the absence of the artificial ice cover, habitat use during the day was restricted to the stream edges, often under undercut banks, whereas under the simulated ice cover condition, trout used the entire width of the stream. These results indicate that the presence of surface ice cover may improve the energetic status and broaden habitat use of stream fish during winter. It is therefore likely that reductions in the duration and extent of ice cover due to climate change will alter time and energy budgets, with potentially negative effects on fish production.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000374564000026	26787075	
J	Skirvin, DJ; Fenlon, JS								The effect of temperature on the functional response of Phytoseiulus persimilis (Acari : Phytoseiidae)								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				31	1-2			37	49		10.1023/B:APPA.0000005107.97373.87				2003	2003	Environmental variables, such as temperature, are important in determining the efficiency of biological control in ornamental crops. This paper examines the effect of temperature on the functional response of adult female Phytoseiulus persimilis to eggs of the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. The functional response was determined using a new functional response assay technique with plant stems as an arena, rather than leaf discs. The use of plant stems allows the influence that plant structure has on predation to be incorporated into the assay. Control assays were also used ( without predators) to estimate natural losses of prey. The data were analysed using a binomial model, with the use of Abbot's formula to correct for the losses in the controls. A combined equation to describe the effect of temperature and prey density on the predation rate of Phytoseiulus persimilis was derived. The results showed that more prey are eaten as the temperature increases from 15 degreesC to 25 degreesC, but the number of prey eaten then declines at 30 degreesC, although not to the levels seen at 20 degreesC. The implication of these results for biological control in ornamental crops, where the temperature can often exceed 30 degreesC, is discussed.									44	4	0	0	45	1	51			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000186759700004	14756399

J	Wintzer, AP; Motta, PJ								The effects of temperature on prey-capture kinematics of the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus): implications for feeding studies								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				82	5			794	799		10.1139/Z04-061				MAY 2004	2004	Research with ectothermic organisms has demonstrated that temperature is positively correlated with an individual's power output during locomotion. This study investigates the effect of temperature on another aspect of power output, prey-capture kinematics, of the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). Feeding sequences for two treatments of four sunfish were filmed at three temperatures (18, 24, and 30 degreesC) with one treatment (A) experiencing an increasing range of temperatures and the other (B) experiencing a decreasing temperature range. Directional temperatures affected prey-capture kinematics. The time required to achieve maximum lower jaw depression and maximum gape, as well as the duration of maximum gape, time to close the mouth (from the point of maximum gape), and the total bite duration, increased as water temperature decreased. In addition, both the time to maximum gape and the time to maximum lower jaw depression were longer at 18 degreesC for individuals in treatment A than those in treatment B. These results indicate that water temperature can bias the results of feeding studies employing kinematics that do not control for its effects as well as those that make comparisons across such studies which utilize different temperatures and taxa.									17	0	0	0	18	0	18			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000225021400015

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				52	3			600	609		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1998.tb02020.x				MAR 1998	1998	Fish may alter their habitat use in accordance with the profitability of differing habitat patches. During summer, in the River Frome, minnows Phoxinus phoxinus used shallows in a selective manner, preferring shallows in which water temperature was higher than the ambient river temperature. During the morning and evening, the minnows occasionally entered the shallows but did not linger. They spent considerably longer periods in the shallows when water temperature was greater than in the main channel of the river. During these periods the minnows were inactive. Gut fullness of wild minnows varied temporally and on one occasion spatially, with gut fullness rising rapidly after dawn and remaining high throughout the day. Minnows held in enclosures in the river had significantly higher gut fullness than those held in the shallows. The minnows use shallows that are warmer than the adjacent river preferentially but must return to the river to feed. Thus, there is evidence for a trade-off between a habitat with high prey density, but low temperature and a low prey density, warmer habitat.

Parallel observations were made on laboratory cultures of each life stage. All juvenile stages of L. angusticollis are voracious predators, preying mainly on the herbivorous copepod Boeckella poppei. Adult beetles additionally predate benthic ostracods. Laboratory predation rates and held population densities found in this study suggest that L. angusticollis has a more significant impact on its prey than recognised in recent studies of South Georgian lakes. Spring field samples contained only a few individuals of larval instar IV and adults. Young larvae were present from December onwards, with a rapid progression through juvenile instars during the summer months. Fourth instar larvae left the water for pupation between mid-December and at least mid-February. Combining these observations with known developmental threshold temperatures for each life stage implies that L. angusticollis has a complex biennial (minimum) life-cycle, with overwintering possible in three life stages [aquatic larvae, terrestrial pupae (not proven) and aquatic adults]. L. angusticollis may be a suitable indicator species in the context of climate warming studies: a small (1 degrees C) rise in mean environmental temperatures, comparable to that already observed at several sub-Antarctic and maritime Antarctic localities, would allow completion of an annual (univoltine) life-cycle, with concomitant rapid population increase, and serious implications for trophic interactions in these simple lake ecosystems.									22	0	0	0	23	0	27			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000075784600001

Global warming is linked to a widespread decline in body size, whereas increased flood frequency can amplify nutrient enrichment through enhanced run-off. Altered population body-size structure represents a disruption in top-down control, whereas eutrophication embodies a change in bottom-up forcing. These processes are typically studied in isolation and little is known about their potential interactive effects. Here, we present the results of an in situ experiment examining the combined effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on the structure of a coastal marine community. Reduced average body mass of the top predator (the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) and nutrient enrichment combined additively to alter mean community body mass. Nutrient enrichment increased species richness and overall density of organisms. Reduced top-predator body mass increased community biomass. Additionally, we found evidence for an allometrically induced trophic cascade. Here, the reduction in top-predator body mass enabled greater biomass of intermediate fish predators within the mesocosms. This, in turn, suppressed key micrograzers, which led to an overall increase in microalgal biomass. This response highlights the possibility for climate-induced trophic cascades, driven by altered size structure of populations, rather than species extinction.									46	0	0	0	43	0	46			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000309253400007	23007084

Developmental period of all stages of O. similis decreased as temperature increased. Relative mortality rate (RMR) revealed that high temperatures caused high mortality, particularly deleterious to egg and nymph at 34 degrees C. Adult females lived longer than adult male at the same temperature. The main factor affecting the predation activity of O. similis was temperature; photoperiod had no significant difference on the predation activity. Our results showed that the most optimal temperature for laboratory rearing of Orius was 28-31 degrees C and the most optimal temperature for releasing O. similis in the field was 30-35 degrees C.									5	5	0	0	9	0	11			0031-0603	2162-0237		WOS:000238275900013

The aims of this study were to: ( 1) assess the temporal pattern of feeding and brooding, ( 2) evaluate the effect of body size, tidal height and temperature on feeding and brooding, ( 3) evaluate temporary changes in digestive and sexual organs and ( 4) investigate the relationships between the predatory and brooding activities. Females do not feed during the brooding period. Spawning proceeded during March. The brooding period was from March to November, with a maximum in May. The population feeding rate varied seasonally, with a maximum in December and a minimum in May. The feeding rate was positively related to water temperature and sea star size; but not with tidal height. An annual cycle exists for pyloric caeca weight in both sexes; lowest values were found during winter, due to brooding female starvation, and a possible decrease in feeding rate of non- brooding females and males. No inverse relationship was found between the pyloric caeca and gonad weights in females, but a lag of 1 month was observed in males, being the maximal pyloric caeca development before the maximum gonad weight, suggesting nutrient translocation.									18	0	0	0	17	2	18			1745-1000	1745-1019		WOS:000250011100006		
J	Seo, H; Kim, S; Seong, K; Kang, SY								Variability in scale growth rates of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in relation to climate changes in the late 1980s								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				68	2-4			205	216		10.1016/j.pocean.2006.02.003				2006	2006	Fish scales were used to investigate the interannual variability in chum salmon growth rates at specific ages in relation to climatic/environmental changes during the 1980s-1990s. Scales were obtained from adult salmon returning to the east coast of Korea between 1984 and 1998. Assuming proportionality between scale size increments and fish length, distances between scale annuli were regarded as the growth conditions in different habitat areas with respect to the life stages of chum salmon. In estuarine and coastal areas, growth rates of fingerling salmon were higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s. Zooplankton abundance off the east coast of Korea increased after the late 1980s, which may have provided favorable growth conditions for young salmon in the 1990s. Growth Of juvenile chum salmon during the first summer (Okhotsk Sea) was relatively stable, and neither SST nor zooplankton biomass fluctuated significantly during the study period. However, in the Bering Sea, salmon growth rates between age-2 and age-4 (i.e. ocean-phase immature salmon) were higher in the 1980s than in the 1990s. Variability in salmon growth in the Bering Sea was correlated to zooplankton biomass. These results suggest that the climate regime shift of 1988/1989 in the subarctic North Pacific affected salmon growth mediated by changes of zooplankton biomass, revealing a bottom-up process.

J	Marsden, ID								Respiration and feeding of the surf clam Paphies donacina from New Zealand								HYDROBIOLOGIA				405				179	188		10.1023/A:1003823527514				JUN 1999	1999	Oxygen uptake and feeding (clearance) rates were measured for the tuatua Pahpies donacina from an exposed sand beach characterised by variable levels of productivity (4-12 mu g l(-1) chlorophyll a) and an annual temperature range between 8 and 19 degrees C. The aims of the study were to assess the ability of the surf clam to regulate feeding activity and oxygen uptake over a range of food concentrations and temperature conditions. Tuatuas, shell length 27-95 mm, were exposed to temperatures of 10, 15 and 20 degrees C in summer and 5, 10 and 15 degrees C in winter. Aquatic oxygen uptake depended on both body weight and exposure temperature with body weight explaining the majority of the variation in the multiple-regression equation. Weight specific oxygen uptake was similar at the two upper temperatures and significantly reduced at the lower temperature. For a standard length tuatua the oxygen uptake was similar at 10 degrees C in both summer and winter. Clearance rates of P. donacina feeding on laboratory cultures of Isochrysis galbana were low compared with other bivalves. They increased logarithmically with cell concentration up to a maximal rate, then declined at higher cell levels. The clearance rate depended upon shell length and dry tissue weight and was higher for tuatua acclimated at 10 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. It was concluded that P. donacina shows seasonal adjustment in oxygen uptake and filtration rate to compensate for seasonal temperature variation in the habitat. The 10 degrees C temperature optima for the clearance rate is consistent with the southern distribution of this species allowing it to feed effectively during periods of high food availability.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000083818600017		
J	Rich, Matthew E.; Gough, Laura; Boelman, Natalie T.				boelman, natalie/K-9789-2015				Arctic arthropod assemblages in habitats of differing shrub dominance								ECOGRAPHY				36	9			994	1003		10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.00078.x				SEP 2013	2013	Recent climate warming in the Arctic has caused advancement in the timing of snowmelt and expansion of shrubs into open tundra. Such an altered climate may directly and indirectly (via effects on vegetation) affect arctic arthropod abundance, diversity and assemblage taxonomic composition. To allow better predictions about how climate changes may affect these organisms, we compared arthropod assemblages between open and shrub-dominated tundra at three field sites in northern Alaska that encompass a range of shrub communities. Over ten weeks of sampling in 2011, pitfall traps captured significantly more arthropods in shrub plots than open tundra plots at two of the three sites. Furthermore, taxonomic richness and diversity were significantly greater in shrub plots than open tundra plots, although this pattern was site-specific as well. Patterns of abundance within the five most abundant arthropod orders differed, with spiders (Order: Araneae) more abundant in open tundra habitats and true bugs (Order: Hemiptera), flies (Order: Diptera), and wasps and bees (Order: Hymenoptera) more abundant in shrub-dominated habitats. Few strong relationships were found between vegetation and environmental variables and arthropod abundance; however, lichen cover seemed to be important for the overall abundance of arthropods. Some arthropod orders showed significant relationships with other vegetation variables, including maximum shrub height (Coleoptera) and foliar canopy cover (Diptera). As climate warming continues over the coming decades, and with further shrub expansion likely to occur, changes in arthropod abundance, richness, and diversity associated with shrub-dominated habitat may have important ecological effects on arctic food webs since arthropods play important ecological roles in the tundra, including in decomposition and trophic interactions.									36	1	0	0	33	0	36			0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:000323701100006

We tested whether the risk of overheating may limit parental provisioning of an aerial insectivorous bird in population decline. For many seasonally breeding birds, parents are thought to operate close to an energetic ceiling during the 2-3 week chick-rearing period. The factors determining the ceiling remain unknown, although it may be set by an individual's capacity to dissipate body heat (the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis). Over two breeding seasons we experimentally trimmed the ventral feathers of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to provide a thermal window. We then monitored maternal and paternal provisioning rates, nestling growth rates and fledging success. We found the effect of our experimental treatment was context dependent. Females with an enhanced capacity to dissipate heat fed their nestlings at higher rates than controls when conditions were hot, but the reverse was true under cool conditions. Control females and their mates both reduced foraging under hot conditions. In contrast, male partners of trimmed females maintained a constant feeding rate across temperatures, suggesting attempts to match the feeding rate of their partners. On average, nestlings of trimmed females were heavier than controls, but did not have a higher probability of fledging. We suggest that removal of a thermal constraint allowed females to increase provisioning rates, but additionally provided nestlings with a thermal advantage via increased heat transfer during maternal brooding. Our data provide support for the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis and suggest that depending on temperature, heat dissipation capacity can influence reproductive success in aerial insectivores.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000541845400014	32321750

Feeding is an ecologically relevant task which is controlled by muscle function. Consequently, in ectotherms, muscle function and feeding kinematics can be altered by temperature. This study investigated the effect of decreasing temperature on the feeding kinematics of the northern most labrid in the Western Atlantic. During winter, cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) enter a state of extended torpor in order to conserve energy when water temperatures drop below similar to 10 degrees C. We hypothesized that feeding kinematics would be slower at lower temperatures especially those associated with torpor (<= 10 degrees C). Additionally, we hypothesized that prey type will elicit different feeding behaviors. Feeding events on sandworms and Asian shore crabs were recorded at 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. Fish held at 5 degrees C had slower opening and closing jaw velocities while using more ram than the other temperature treatments. No differences were detected between prey types. For both prey types, the temperature treatment which consistently induced torpor (5 degrees C) slowed oral jaw movements, which likely forced cunner to rely more on ram than suction to capture prey. Torpor temperatures appeared to have less of an effect on feeding than on metabolic rate, steady swimming capabilities and muscle function, suggesting some compensatory mechanisms of feeding musculature in cunner.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000458431500005

Little is known explicitly about how low salinity and high temperature combinations affect spat (<25mm), seed (25-75mm), andmarket (>75mm) oyster growth and mortality. Using field and laboratory studies, this project quantified the combined effects of extremely low salinities (< 5) and high temperatures (>30 degrees C) on growth and survival of spat, seed, andmarket-sized oysters. In 2012 and 2013, hatchery-produced oysters were placed in open and closed cages at three sites in Breton Sound, LA, along a salinity gradient that typically ranged from 5 to 20. Growth and mortality were recorded monthly. Regardless of size class, oysters at the lowest salinity site (annualmean = 4.8) experienced significantly highermortality and lower growth than oysters located in higher salinity sites (annual means = 11.1 and 13.0, respectively); furthermore, all oysters in open cages at the two higher salinity sites experienced higher mortality than in closed cages, likely due to predation. To explicitly examine oyster responses to extreme low salinity and high temperature combinations, a series of laboratory studies were conducted. Oysters were placed in 18 tanks in a fully crossed temperature (25 degrees C, 32 degrees C) by salinity (1, 5, and 15) study with three replicates, and repeated at least twice for each oyster size class. Regardless of temperature, seed and market oysters held in low salinity tanks (salinity 1) experienced 100% mortality within 7 days. In contrast, at salinity 5, temperature significantly affected mortality; oysters in all size classes experienced greater than 50% mortality at 32 degrees C and less than 40% mortality at 25 degrees C. At the highest salinity tested (15), only market-sized oysters held at 32 degrees C experienced significant mortality (>60%). These studies demonstrate that high water temperatures (>30 degrees C) and low salinities (< 5) negatively impact oyster growth and survival differentially and that high temperatures alone may negatively impact market-sized oysters. It is critical to understand the potential impacts of climate and anthropogenic changes on oyster resources to better adapt and manage for long-term sustainability.									19	1	0	0	19	0	19			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000376743800012

These saprophagous macroarthropods, which are key regulators of plant litter decomposition, play an important role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems in tropical and temperate areas. Herein we review current knowledge on the effects of climate, food quality and land cover on millipede and woodlouse species to explore their potential responses to global change. Essentially similar trends are observed in the two taxa. Experiments have shown that climate warming could result in higher rates of population growth and have positive effects on the abundance of some temperate species. This is consistent with signs of northward expansion in Europe, although the mechanisms of dispersal remain unclear. The generality of this finding is evaluated in relation to the life histories and geographical distributions of species. At low latitudes, interactions with more severe droughts are likely and could affect community composition. Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and changes in plant community composition are expected to alter leaf litter quality, a major determinant of macroarthropod fertility via the link with female adult body size. Although food quality changes have been shown to influence population growth rates significantly, it is proposed that the effects of warming will be probably more important during the coming decades. Land cover changes, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and land abandonment in Europe, are critical to habitat specialists and could override any other effect of global change. Habitat destruction by man may be the main threat to macroarthropod species, many of which are narrow endemics. At the landscape scale, habitat heterogeneity could be a good option for conservation, even at the cost of some fragmentation. Two principal areas are identified which require further work: (i) the effects of climate change across broader geographic ranges, and on species with different ecologies and life histories; (ii) the effects of global change on both macroarthropods and their natural enemies (predators, parasites and pathogens), to improve predictions in field situations.									78	3	0	0	78	2	84			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000282880900011	20412191	
J	Warren, Donald T.; McCormick, Mark, I								Intrageneric differences in the effects of acute temperature exposure on competitive behaviour of damselfishes								PEERJ				7						e7320	10.7717/peerj.7320				JUL 17 2019	2019	Projected increases in global temperatures brought on by climate change threaten to disrupt many biological and ecological processes. Tropical ectotherms, like many fishes, can be particularly susceptible to temperature change as they occupy environments with narrow thermal fluctuations. While climate change models predict temperatures to increase over decades, thermal fluctuations are already experienced on a seasonal scale, which may affect the ability to capture and defend resources across a thermal gradient. For coral reef fish, losers of competitive interactions are often more vulnerable to predation, and this pressure is strongest just after settlement. Competitive interactions may determine future success for coral reef fishes, and understanding how temperature experienced during settlement can influence such interactions will give insight to community dynamics in a future warmer world. We tested the effect of increased temperatures on intraspecific competitive interactions of two sympatric species of reef damselfish, the blue damselfish Pomacentrus nagasakiensis, and the whitetail damselfish Pomacentrus chrysurus. Juvenile fishes were exposed to one of four temperature treatments, ranging from 26-32 degrees C, for seven days then placed into competitive arenas where aggressive interactions were recorded between sized matched individuals within each species. While there was no apparent effect of temperature treatment on aggressive behaviour for P. chrysurus, we observed up to a four-fold increase in aggression scores for P. nagasakiensis with increasing temperature. Results suggest that temperature experienced as juveniles can impact aggressive behaviour; however, species-specific thermal tolerances led to behavioural affects that differ among closely related species. Differential thermal tolerance among species may cause restructuring of the interaction network that underlies the structure of reef assemblages.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000475841800003	31346499

However, whereas most studies focus on single factors in isolation, mainly due to interrelation and correlation among drivers complicating interpretation and analyses, there are still only few studies on how multiple ecosystems respond to climate related factors at the same time. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model with a bioenergetic predatorprey framework to study how different climatic factors affect trophic interactions and production in small Arctic lakes. Natural variation in temperature and catchment land-cover was used as a natural experiment to exemplify how interactions between and production of primary producers (phytoplankton) and grazers (zooplankton) are driven by direct (temperature) and indirect (catchment vegetation) factors, as well as the presence or absence of apex predators (fish). The results show that increased vegetation cover increased phytoplankton growth rate by mediating lake nutrient concentration. At the same time, increased temperature also increased grazing rates by zooplankton. Presence of fish increased zooplankton mortality rates, thus reducing grazing. The Arctic is currently experiencing an increase in both temperature and shrub vegetation cover due to climate change, a trend, which is likely to continue. Our results point towards a possible future general weakening of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton and greening of arctic lakes with increasing temperatures. At the same time, the impact of the presence of an apex predator indicate considerable local variation in the response. This makes direction and strength of global change impacts difficult to forecast.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000399874800010	28414736	
J	Starfield, AM; Chapin, FS				Chapin, F Stuart/AAZ-3931-2020	Chapin, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910			Model of transient changes in arctic and boreal vegetation in response to climate and land use change								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				6	3			842	864		10.2307/2269489				AUG 1996	1996	One of the greatest challenges in global-change research is to predict the future distribution of vegetation. Most models of vegetation change predict either the response of a patch of present vegetation to climatic change or the future equilibrium distribution of vegetation based on the present relationship between climate and vegetation. Here we present a model that is, to our knowledge, the first model of ecosystem change in response to transient changes in climate, disturbance regime, and recruitment over the next 50-500 yr. The frame-based model uses quantitative and qualitative variables to develop scenarios of vegetation change from arctic tundra to boreal forest in response to global changes in climate (as predicted by general circulation models [GCMs]), fire, and land use. Seed availability, tree growth rate, and probability of fire were the model parameters that most strongly influenced the balance between tundra and boreal forest in transitional climates. The rate of climatic warming strongly affected the time lag between the onset of climate change and the simulated ecosystem response but had relatively little effect on the rate or pattern of ecosystem change. The model calculated that, with a gradual ramped change of 3 degrees C in the next century (corresponding to average rate of warming predicted by GCMs), any change from tundra to forest would take 150 yr, consistent with pollen records. The model suggested that tundra would first be invaded by conifer forests, but that the proportion of broad-leaved deciduous forest would increase, reflecting increased fire frequency, as climatic warming continued. The change in fire frequency was determined more strongly by climatically driven changes in vegetation than by direct climatic effects on fire probability. The pattern of climatic warming was more important than the rate of warming or change in precipitation in determining the rate of conversion from tundra to forest. Increased climatic variability promoted ecosystem change, particularly when oscillations were long relative to the time required for tree maturation. Management policies related to logging and moose-predator control affected vegetation as much or more than did changes in climate and must be included in future scenarios of global changes in ecosystem distribution. We suggest that frame-based models provide a critical link between patch and equilibrium models in predicting ecosystem change in response to transient changes in climate over the coming decades to centuries.									100	0	0	0	63	0	103			1051-0761			WOS:A1996UZ41200030		
J	Panov, VE; McQueen, DJ								Effects of temperature on individual growth rate and body size of a freshwater amphipod								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				76	6			1107	1116		10.1139/cjz-76-6-1107				JUN 1998	1998	Individual growth rates of the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca (Saussure) were measured in the littoral zone of two small oligotrophic Ontario lakes and in growth experiments over a natural temperature gradient (10, 15, 20, and 23 degrees C). Field observations showed that a temperature of 20 degrees C is important for both the induction and termination of reproductive resting stages in H. azteca. Growth rates were more affected by temperature in small than in large individuals. Growth parameters are related to rearing temperature by linear regressions, which can be used as a simple model for bioenergetics calculations in crustaceans. A negative relationship between water temperature and maximum size attained by the amphipods was found. The largest adults were absent in studied populations when summer temperatures were high, and this phenomenon, which has also been observed in other aquatic invertebrates, was bioenergetically determined. Energy-budget estimations showed negative net growth efficiency (K-2) in the largest adults at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The relationship between K-2 and temperature showed a dome-shaped pattern, K-2 values for larger amphipods being maximal at lower temperatures. Seasonal migrations of adult H. azteca from shallow littoral to deeper cold habitats, observed in lakes during the warmest periods, appear to be temperature-induced and bioenergetically advantageous, despite probable increases in predation risk experienced in spatially simple deep-water habitats.									51	2	0	0	47	2	52			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000077327300013

Such effects have been observed in many traits across many species. Despite enormous potential importanceparticularly in an era of rapid climate changeTGP in thermal growth physiology has never been demonstrated for vertebrates. We provide the first evidence for thermal TGP in a vertebrate: given sufficient time, sheepshead minnows adaptively program their offspring for maximal growth at the present temperature. The change in growth over a single generation (c. 30%) exceeds the single-generation rate of adaptive evolution by an order of magnitude. If widespread, transgenerational effects on thermal performance may have important implications on physiology, ecology and contemporary evolution, and may significantly alter the extinction risk posed by changing climate.									185	2	0	0	175	0	187			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000298848200010	22188553

In the study, the functional response of C malaccensis against Aleuroglyphus ovatus was investigated under five constant temperatures of 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 degrees C. The results showed that the functional response of adult C. malaccensis to different stages of A. ovatus was conformed to Holling II. Under the temperature between 16 and 32 degrees C, C. malaccensis females consumed more larvae and nymphs, followed by male and females of A. ovatus. While male C malaccensis merely consumed larvae and nymphs of prey. Adult C malaccensis ate few eggs of A. ovatus. The daily consumption and instantaneous attack rate (a/Th) increased with the temperature increasing from 16 degrees C to 32 degrees C while the peak was at 28 degrees C. The maximum daily consumption for larva and a/Th of female C malaccensis are 135.1 and 110.7, respectively. Cheyletus malaccensis showed positive preference to larvae and nymphs, while negative preference to adults and eggs of A. ovatus. Because of the competition and interference among predators, the predation efficiency decreased with the density of predator increasing, and the interference coefficient (m) was 0.485 at 28 degrees C. These results could be helpful to provide theoretical basis and practical instructions for the biological control of A. ovatus by C malaccensis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Macroalgae-herbivore interactions have a main role in the regulation of marine community structure (top-down control). Gradients of warming prompt complex non-linear effects on organism metabolism, cascading into altered trophic interactions and community dynamics. However, not much is known on how will acidification and grazer assemblage composition shape these effects. Within this context, we aimed to assess the combined effects of warming gradients and acidification on macroalgae-herbivore interactions, using three cosmopolitan species, abundant in the Iberian Peninsula and closely associated in nature: the amphipod Melita palmata, the gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis, and the green macroalga Ulva rigida. Under two CO2 treatments (triangle CO2 similar or equal to 450 mu atm) across a temperature gradient (13.5, 16.6, 19.9 and 22.1 degrees C), two mesocosm experiments were performed to assess grazer consumption rates and macroalgae-herbivore interaction, respectively. Warming (Experiment I and II) and acidification (Experiment II) prompted negative effects in grazer's survival and species-specific differences in consumption rates. M. palmata was shown to be the stronger grazer per biomass (but not per capita), and also the most affected by climate stressors. Macroalgae-herbivore interaction strength was markedly shaped by the temperature gradient, while simultaneous acidification lowered thermal optimal threshold. In the near future, warming and acidification are likely to strengthen top-down control, but further increases in disturbances may lead to bottom-up regulated communities. Finally, our results suggest that grazer assemblage composition may modulate future macroalgae-herbivore interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining Data Sources to Understand Drivers of Spotted Salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) Population Abundance								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				52	2			116	126		10.1670/17.110				JUN 2018	2018	Robust methods for estimating abundance of wetland-breeding amphibian species, such as mark-recapture, are often resource intensive. This limits our ability to study the processes that influence species abundance. Alternatively, more efficient sampling methods, such as indices based on visual encounter surveys (VES) (e.g., egg masses), may be biased by variability in detection probabilities and species biology (e.g., no. of egg masses per female). We combine data sources (i.e., VES and capture-mark-recapture) to provide an efficient technique for monitoring wetland-breeding amphibians. Our study focuses on understanding factors that determine local abundance of Spotted Salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum, in Pennsylvania. We fast estimated abundance for a subset of wetlands using single-season, capture-mark-recapture data and then verified egg-mass counts collected from a wider network of wetlands as an unbiased index of abundance. We found a strong correlation between estimated adult abundance and estimated egg-mass abundance with an estimated ratio of one egg mass per adult per breeding effort. We next determined the factors that best explained variation in estimated A. maculation egg-mass abundance and consequently, adult abundance among sites. Our "best-fit" model included effects for wetland hydroperiod and quadratic effects of mean water temperature. We also report positive, but weak, association with two cooccurring amphibian species, Jefferson Salamanders, A. jeffersonianum and Wood Frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus. We demonstrate how combining sampling approaches can provide efficient abundance estimates in wetland ecosystems. In particular, positive co-occurrence among species indicates shared habitat preferences that may enable us to predict the presence of difficult-to-detect species using only VES.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000434794900002

While considerable emphasis has been placed on terrestrial ecology consequences, aquatic environments have received relatively little attention. Limited knowledge is available on the biological effects of increments of seawater temperature and pH decrements on key ecological species, i.e., primary producers and/or organisms representative of the basis of the trophic web. In the present study, we addressed the biological effects of global warming and ocean acidification on two model organisms, the microbenthic marine ciliate Euplotes crassus and the green alga Dunaliella tertiocleta using a suite of high level ecological endpoint tests and sub-lethal stress measures. Organisms were exposed to combinations of pH and temperature (TR1: 7.9([pH]), 25.5 degrees C and TR2: 7.8([pH]), 27,0 degrees C) simulating two possible environmental scenarios predicted to occur in the habitats of the selected species before the end of this century. The outcomes of the present study showed that the tested scenarios did not induce a significant increment of mortality on protozoa. Under the most severe exposure conditions, sub-lethal stress indices show that pH homeostatic mechanisms have energetic costs that divert energy from essential cellular processes and functions. The marine protozoan exhibited significant impairment of the lysosomal compartment and early signs of oxidative stress under these conditions. Similarly, significant impairment of photosynthetic efficiency and an increment in lipid peroxidation were observed in the autotroph model organism held under the most extreme exposure condition tested.

It is found from the Subtropical Convergence southward to the coastal Antarctic Seas but being most abundant in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. Low temperatures appear to negatively affect their development, limiting their ability to occur in the krill dominated high Antarctic ecosystems. Yet reports indicate that with ocean warming S. thompsoni have experienced a southward shift in their distribution. As they are efficient filter feeders, this shift can result in large-scale changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem by increasing competitive or predatory interactions with Antarctic krill. To explore salp bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean a size-structured S. thompsoni population model was developed with growth, consumption, reproduction and mortality rates dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a conditions. The largest uncertainties in S. thompsoni population ecology are individual and population growth rates, with a recent study identifying the possibility that the life cycle could be much shorter than previously considered. Here we run a suite of hypothesis scenarios under various environmental conditions to determine the most appropriate growth rate. Temperature and chlorophyll a were sufficient drivers to recreate seasonal and interannual dynamics of salp populations at two locations. The most suitable growth model suggests that mean S. thompsoni growth rates are likely to be similar to 1 mm body length d(-1), 2-fold higher than previous calculations. S. thompsoni biomass was dependent on bud release time, with larger biomass years corresponding to bud release occurring during favorable environmental conditions; increasing the survival and growth of blastozooids and resulting in higher embryo release. This model confirms that it is necessary for growth and reproductive rates to be flexible in order for the salp population to adapt to varying environmental conditions and provides a framework that can examine how future salp populations might respond to climate change.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000451653800003

JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				19	9			1275	1288		10.1093/plankt/19.9.1275				SEP 1997	1997	Feeding on natural plankton populations and respiration of the small cyclopoid copepod Oithona similis were measured during the warm season in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA. Although O. similis did not significantly ingest small autotrophic and heterotrophic flagellates (2-8 mu m), this copepod actively fed on >10 mu m particles, including autotrophic/heterotrophic (dino)flagellates and ciliates, with clearance rates of 0.03-0.38 ml animal(-1) h(-1). The clearance rates increased with the prey size. O. similis also fed on copepod nauplii (mainly composed of the N1 stage of Acartia tonsa) with a clearance rate of 0.16 ml animal(-1) h(-1). Daily carbon ration from the combination of these food items averaged 148 ng C animal(-1) day(-1) (41% of body C day(-1)), with ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates being the main food source (similar to 69% of total carbon ration). Respiration rates were 0.20-0.23 mu l O-2 animal(-1) day(-1). Assuming a respiratory quotient of 0.8 and digestion efficiency of 0.7, the carbon requirement for respiration was calculated to be 125-143 ng C animal(-1) day(-1), close to the daily carbon ration estimated above. We conclude that predation on ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates was important for O. similis to sustain its population in our study area during the warm season.									116	3	2	0	99	1	123			0142-7873			WOS:A1997XW79100006

The present study documented the temporal and spatial larval supply patterns of five Caribbean lizardfish species together with environmental variables (solar radiation, rainfall, water temperature, onshore-offshore winds, alongshore winds and wind-induced turbulence) to examine: (1) whether species within the same family respond differently to their developmental environment and (2) if larval supply in year-round warm waters is influenced by climatic changes. To address these questions, late-stage larvae of Synodus foetens, Synodus intermedius, Synodus poeyi, Saurida suspicio and Saurida brasiliensis were collected in replicate light traps in three different reef habitats (back-reef, lagoon and exposed) in the San Blas Archipelago, Panama, over 18 consecutive lunar months. Although replenishment of lizardfish occurred year-round, the temporal and spatial supply patterns were species-specific: S. foetens, S. intermedius and S. poeyi were most abundant during the dry season while S. suspicio and S. brasiliensis were most prevalent during the wet season. When seasons were analysed separately, water temperature explained 39 and 26% of the variance in light trap catches of S. foetens and S. intermedius, respectively, in the dry season while wind-induced turbulence accounted for 25% of the variability in S. suspicio and S. brasiliensis catches during the wet season. These findings stress the importance of analysing larval supply in conjunction with environmental data at a high taxonomic resolution to better understand the mechanisms that drive replenishment in reef systems at low latitudes.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000268323800022
