abstract={Warming and predation risk are ubiquitous environmental factors that can modify life histories and population dynamics of aquatic ectotherms. While separate responses to each of these factors are well understood, their joint effects on individual life histories and population dynamics remain largely unexplored. Current theory predicts that the magnitude of prey behavioural, physiological, and life history responses to predation risk should diminish with warming due to the reduced metabolic scope. However, empirical support for this prediction remains equivocal, and experiments covering a substantial proportion of individual prey ontogeny until maturation are lacking. To fill these gaps, we ran a laboratory experiment to investigate how warming and non-consumptive predation risk influence life history responses in the larvae of the mayfly Cloeon dipterum, an aquatic insect with highly plastic development. We reared larvae of varying initial sizes at three temperatures (21, 24, and 27°C) in a risk-free environment and under predation risk signalled by chemical cues from dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea), and followed their individual survival, growth, and development until emergence. Some C. dipterum larvae substantially prolonged their development and the proportion of these slow individuals declined rapidly with temperature and increased with predation risk. We attribute this response to cohort splitting, a common life history strategy of aquatic insects and other taxa in unpredictable environment. Growth, development, and maturation varied predictably with temperature in the fast larvae that did not prolong their development. They grew and developed faster but matured at smaller sizes with increasing temperature. Predation risk tended to slow down individual growth and development in line with the reduced metabolic scope hypothesis, but the differences were relatively minor and observable only at 21°C. Survival to subimago increased with predation risk, possibly due to indirect effects mediated by dissolved micronutrients, but did not vary significantly with temperature. Survival also tended to be higher in the slow individuals. This partly compensated for a smaller final size relative to the fast individuals and made both strategies comparable in overall fitness. Our results show that warming may erode individual-level variability in life history responses to predation risk. This implies that warming can synchronise population dynamics and consequently make such populations more vulnerable to unpredictable disturbances. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Climate warming and species traits interact to influence predator performance, including individual feeding and growth rates. However, the effects of an important trait—predator foraging strategy—are largely unknown. We investigated the interactions between predator foraging strategy and temperature on two ectotherm predators: an active predator, the backswimmer Notonecta undulata, and a sit-and-wait predator, the damselfly Enallagma annexum. In a series of predator–prey experiments across a temperature gradient, we measured predator feeding rates on an active prey species, zooplankton Daphnia pulex, predator growth rates, and mechanisms that influence predator feeding: body speed of predators and prey (here measured as swimming speed), prey encounter rates, capture success, attack rates, and handling time. Overall, warming led to increased feeding rates for both predators through changes to each component of the predator’s functional response. We found that prey swimming speed strongly increased with temperature. The active predator’s swimming speed also increased with temperature, and together, the increase in predator and prey swimming speed resulted in twofold higher prey encounter rates for the active predator at warmer temperatures. By contrast, prey encounter rates of the sit-and-wait predator increased fourfold with rising temperatures as a result of increased prey swimming speed. Concurrently, increased prey swimming speed was associated with a decline in the active predator’s capture success at high temperatures, whereas the sit-and-wait predator’s capture success slightly increased with temperature. We provide some of the first evidence that foraging traits mediate the indirect effects of warming on predator performance. Understanding how traits influence species’ responses to warming could clarify how climate change will affect entire functional groups of species. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Life history strategies shape many aspects of species’ ecological importance and population demographics. For ectotherms, life history strategies are highly dependent on temperature, among other environmental conditions. With projected increases in global temperatures, understanding the success of organisms under warmer conditions is critical. Due to the difficulty of establishing long-term heating studies on whole lake systems, there is little empirical evidence addressing the potential changes in life history strategies of fish in situ in response to future climate warming predictions. Here, we study early growth rates, size-at-maturation, maximum adult size, and lifespan of bluegill sunfish in three lakes in Illinois from 2013 to 2017 that experience above-ambient temperatures year-round due to artificial heating by electrical power plant cooling systems and compare these to populations in three nearby ambient lakes. Temperature changes in the heated lakes are within the range of temperature increases predicted by the year 2100. We find evidence that life history strategies and population demographics are substantially affected by warmer environments. Heated populations showed 22% faster first-year growth, 23% shorter lifespans, greater rates of maturation at small body sizes, and over a 4-fold reduction in the relative number of individuals that reach large sizes. Changes in life history strategies, including lifespan and maximum sizes, will be evident across many fish species under warmer conditions in the future and further research should aim to address how these changes will affect trophic interactions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Temperature dependency of consumer–resource interactions is fundamentally important for understanding and predicting the responses of food webs to climate change. Previous studies have shown temperature-driven shifts in herbivore consumption rates and resource preference, but these effects remain poorly understood for predatory arthropods. Here, we investigate how predator killing rates, prey mass consumption, and macronutrient intake respond to increased temperatures using a laboratory and a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Ectothermic predators, wolf spiders (Pardosa sp.), in the lab experiment, were exposed to increased temperatures and different prey macronutrient content (high lipid/low protein and low lipid/high protein) to assess changes in their killing rates and nutritional demands. Additionally, we investigate prey mass and lipid consumption by spiders under contrasting temperatures, along an elevation gradient. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment between low (420 masl; 26°C) and high (2,100 masl; 15°C) elevations in the Ecuadorian Andes, using wild populations of two common orb-weaver spider species (Leucauge sp. and Cyclosa sp.) present along the elevation gradient. We found that killing rates of wolf spiders increased with warmer temperatures but were not significantly affected by prey macronutrient content, although spiders consumed significantly more lipids from lipid-rich prey. The field reciprocal transplant experiment showed no consistent predator responses to changes in temperature along the elevational gradient. Transplanting Cyclosa sp. spiders to low- or high-elevation sites did not affect their prey mass or lipid consumption rate, whereas Leucauge sp. individuals increased prey mass consumption when transplanted from the high to the low warm elevation. Our findings show that increases in temperature intensify predator killing rates, prey consumption, and lipid intake, but the responses to temperature vary between species, which may be a result of species-specific differences in their hunting behavior and sensitivity to temperature. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Temperature is a critical abiotic factor impacting all aspects of the biology of organisms, especially in ectotherms. As such, it is an important determinant of the potential invasive ability of organisms and may limit population expansion unless organisms can physiologically respond to changes in temperature either through plasticity or by adapting to their novel environment. Here, we studied the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, which has become invasive on a global scale. We compared adults from an invasive population of western France with individuals from two populations in the native range in South Africa. We measured the thermal dependence of locomotor performance in adults given its relevance to dispersal, predator escape, and prey capture. Our results show significant differences in the limits of the 80% performance breadth interval for endurance with the French population showing a left shift in its limits congruent with the colder climate experienced in France. The French invasive population was introduced only about 40 years ago suggesting a rapid shift in the thermal physiology. Given that all individuals were acclimated under laboratory conditions at 23°C for 2 months this suggests that the invasive frogs have adapted to their new environment. These data may allow the refinement of physiologically informed species distribution models permitting better estimates of future ranges at risk of invasion. © The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={Ocean warming impacts the fitness of marine ectothermic species, leading to poleward range shifts, re-shuffling of communities, and changes in ecosystem services. While the detrimental effects of summer heat waves have been widely studied, little is known about the impacts of winter warming on marine species in temperate regions. Many species benefit from low winter temperature-induced reductions in metabolism, as these permit conservation of energy reserves that are needed to support reproduction in spring. Here, we used a unique outdoor mesocosm system to expose a coastal predator-prey system, the sea star Asterias and the blue mussel Mytilus, to different winter warming scenarios under near-natural conditions. We found that the body condition of mussels decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. Sea star growth also decreased with increasing temperature, which was a function of unaltered predation rates and decreased mussel body condition. Asterias relative digestive gland mass strongly declined over the studied temperature interval (ca twofold). This could have severe implications for reproductive capacity in the following spring, as digestive glands provide reserve compounds to maturing gonads. Thus, both predator and prey suffered from a mismatch of energy acquisition versus consumption in warmer winter scenarios, with pronounced consequences for food web energy transfer in future oceans. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Movements of ectotherms are constrained by their body temperature owing to the effects of temperature on muscle physiology. As physical performance often affects the outcome of predator-prey interactions, environmental temperature can influence the ability of ectotherms to capture prey and/or defend themselves against predators. However, previous research on the kinematics of ectotherms suggests that some species may use elastic storage mechanisms when attacking or defending, thereby mitigating the effects of sub-optimal temperature. Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) are a speciose group of ectothermic viperid snakes that rely on crypsis, rattling and striking to deter predators. We examined the influence of body temperature on the behavior and kinematics of two rattlesnake species (Crotalus oreganus helleri and Crotalus scutulatus) when defensively striking towards a threatening stimulus. We recorded defensive strikes at body temperatures ranging from 15-35°C. We found that strike speed and speed of mouth gaping during the strike were positively correlated with temperature. We also found a marginal effect of temperature on the probability of striking, latency to strike and strike outcome. Overall, warmer snakes are more likely to strike, strike faster, open their mouth faster and reach maximum gape earlier than colder snakes. However, the effects of temperature were less than would be expected for purely muscle-driven movements. Our results suggest that, although rattlesnakes are at a greater risk of predation at colder body temperatures, their decrease in strike performance may be mitigated to some extent by employing mechanisms in addition to skeletal muscle contraction (e.g. elastic energy storage) to power strikes. © 2020.

abstract={Higher temperatures as a consequence of global climate change may considerably alter trophic interactions. Ectothermic herbivores and carnivores generally ingest more food with rising temperature as their metabolic rates increase with rising temperature. However, omnivorous ectotherms may respond in two ways: quantitatively by consuming more food and qualitatively by altering their degree of herbivory or carnivory through a diet shift. We hypothesize that rising temperature will increase herbivory of ectothermic omnivores as herbivory increases towards the equator. We tested the hypothesis in a freshwater model system in which ectothermic omnivores are prevalent, by applying two approaches, a temperature manipulation experiment and a literature study. We performed feeding trials with a juvenile aquatic ectothermic omnivore (pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) at different temperatures ranging from 12 to 27°C, supplying them with both animal food and plant material, and directly quantified their consumption rates over time. The results showed that snails cultured at high temperatures (> 21°C) increased the proportion of plant material in their diets after 17 days, which supports our hypothesis. In the literature survey, we found that rising temperature increased herbivory in multiple aquatic animal taxa, including zooplankton, amphibians, crayfish, fish and snails. This suggests that aquatic ectothermic omnivores might commonly increase herbivory with rising temperature. The mechanisms underlying this temperature-induced diet shift are not sufficiently explained by current theories related to the physiology, metabolism and stoichiometry of omnivores. We propose to incorporate the animals’ ontogenetic development in the temperature metabolic stoichiometry hypothesis as a complementary explanation for the diet shift, namely that the diet shift could be due to faster development of the ectotherms and an earlier ontogenetic diet shift at higher temperatures. We conclude that future global warming will most likely alter food webs by increasing the top–down control of aquatic herbivores and omnivores on primary producers. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

abstract={Rate of colour change and background matching capacity are important functional traits for avoiding predation and hiding from prey. Acute changes in environmental temperature are known to impact the rate at which animals change colour, and therefore may affect their survival. Many ectotherms have the ability to acclimate performance traits such as locomotion, metabolic rate and growth rate with changes in seasonal temperature. However, it remains unclear how other functional traits that are directly linked to behaviour and survival respond to long-term changes in temperature (within an individual's lifetime). We assessed whether the rate of colour change is altered by long-term changes in temperature (seasonal variation) and if rate of colour change can acclimate to seasonal thermal conditions. We used an intertidal rock-pool goby Bathygobius cocosensis, to test this and exposed individuals to representative seasonal mean temperatures (16 or 31°C, herein referred to cold- and warm-exposed fish respectively) for 9 weeks and then tested their rate of luminance change when placed on white and black backgrounds at acute test temperatures 16 and 31°C. We modelled rate of luminance change using the visual sensitives of a coral trout Plectropmus leopardus to determine how well gobies matched their backgrounds in terms of luminance contrast to a potential predator. After exposure to long-term seasonal conditions, the warm-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their background more closely when tested at 31 than at 16°C. Similarly, the cold-exposed fish had faster rates of luminance change and matched their backgrounds more closely at 16°C than at 31°C. This demonstrates that rate of luminance change can be adjusted to compensate for long-term changes in seasonal temperature. This is the first study to show that animals can acclimate rate of colour change for background matching to seasonal thermal conditions. We also show that rapid changes in acute temperature reduce background matching capabilities. Stochastic changes in climate are likely to affect the frequency of predator–prey interactions which may have substantial knock-on effects throughout ecosystems. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The temperature–size rule is a well-known example of phenotypic plasticity in ectothermic organisms. When exposed to colder temperatures, ectotherms develop more slowly, but mature at larger body sizes and vice versa at higher temperatures. We investigated whether a phytoseiid predatory mite can obtain a larger body size by rearing it at a low temperature and how the increased body size affected predatory performance on its natural prey. Therefore, we allowed the predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to develop at either 15 or 25 °C. RESULTS: A. limonicus reared at 15 °C had a 6% larger body size than those reared at 25 °C. Larger predators showed higher predation rates on first instars of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), with 9.6 instars/female/day and 8.5 instars/female/day, for larger and standard-sized females, respectively. After three generations reared at 15 °C, body size did not increase any further. When reared for five generations at 15 °C, larger A. limonicus females demonstrated a better ability to subdue second-instar F. occidentalis. CONCLUSION: Low juvenile rearing temperatures may result in phytoseiid predators with a predator/prey size benefit that could improve their biological control function. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Extreme climatic events, such as heat waves, may induce changes in nutrient acquisition by omnivorous ectotherms. Likely modulated by the intensity, frequency and duration of these events, dietary shifts during heat waves may threaten the stability of freshwaters. We investigated the effects of heat wave duration on diet assimilation and life-history traits of the freshwater gastropod Radix balthica. We compared the magnitude of the effects of a short (1 week) and a long heat wave (7 weeks) on the assimilation of animal- and plant-based diets, measuring performance in terms of growth rate and reproduction. We hypothesized that heat waves should increase the proportion of plant material assimilated on the mixed diet and change the performance of snails on the animal and plant-based diets. Both heat waves increased the assimilation of plant material on the mixed diet and growth rate, with minor negative effects on reproduction. However, responses were disproportional to heat wave duration, as the short heat wave elicited swift and relatively stronger responses. Our findings showcase the role of phenotypic plasticity in aiding ectotherms to cope with increased thermal stress and acclimate. Temporarily changing the strength of trophic interactions, heat waves may alter community dynamics in freshwater habitats. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Predation, which is a fundamental force in ecosystems, has been found to decrease in intensity with elevation and latitude. The mechanisms behind this pattern, however, remain unaddressed. Using visual sampling of potential predators and live flies as baits, we assessed predation patterns along 4,000-m elevation transects on either side of the equatorial Andes. At the lower elevations, we found that around 80% of predation events on our insect baits were due to ants. The decline in predation with elevation was driven mainly by a decline in the abundance of ants, whose importance relative to other predators also declined. We show that both predator density and activity (predation rate per individual predator) decreased with elevation, thus ascribing specific mechanisms to known predation patterns. We suggest that changes in these two mechanisms may reflect changes in primary productivity and metabolic rate with temperature, factors of potential relevance across latitudinal and other macroecological gradients, particularly for ectotherm predators and prey. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={For ectothermic animals, ambient temperature strongly influences developmental growth rate and individual fitness. While many ectotherms live in environments that are spatially hetero-thermal, the coupling between behavioural phenotypes (e.g., shy or bold behaviour) and thermal preferences remains uncertain. Relative to shy counterparts, bolder phenotypes may exert higher preference for ambient temperatures that are closer to their thermal optimum, thereby accelerating development. In addition, ectotherms should select colder temperatures in low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis. Using wild caught carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus), this study examined thermoregulatory behaviour in individuals exhibiting consistent behavioural phenotypes along the shy-bold continuum and between ecologically relevant normal oxygen concentration (normoxic) and hypoxic treatments. Furthermore, the behaviour observed in the laboratory was compared to environmental data from the natal stream. Results demonstrated that individual shy-bold behavioural phenotype was consistent before and after a simulated aerial predator attack, indicating consistency of behaviour across situations. Individual preferred and avoidance temperatures varied substantially, but were unrelated to shy-bold behavioural phenotypes. In contrast, individual preferred and maximum avoidance temperatures were significantly reduced in hypoxia, consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis. These findings might indicate suppressed development rates in hypoxia, not only by the limited oxygen for aerobic metabolism, but also by the preference for colder water in hypoxia. Furthermore, the tolerated thermal ranges were reduced in hypoxia. Using test conditions confirmed by field data, our study demonstrates the strong influence of oxygen availability on thermoregulatory behaviours and preferences in aquatic environments. © 2019},

abstract={Temperature influences biological processes of ectotherms including ecological interactions, but interaction strengths may depend on species-specific traits. Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20°C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P. fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F. candida, but killed F. candida when P. fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Projected increases in global temperatures brought on by climate change threaten to disrupt many biological and ecological processes. Tropical ectotherms, like many fishes, can be particularly susceptible to temperature change as they occupy environments with narrow thermal fluctuations. While climate change models predict temperatures to increase over decades, thermal fluctuations are already experienced on a seasonal scale, which may affect the ability to capture and defend resources across a thermal gradient. For coral reef fish, losers of competitive interactions are often more vulnerable to predation, and this pressure is strongest just after settlement. Competitive interactions may determine future success for coral reef fishes, and understanding how temperature experienced during settlement can influence such interactions will give insight to community dynamics in a future warmer world. We tested the effect of increased temperatures on intraspecific competitive interactions of two sympatric species of reef damselfish, the blue damselfish Pomacentrus nagasakiensis, and the whitetail damselfish Pomacentrus chrysurus. Juvenile fishes were exposed to one of four temperature treatments, ranging from 26-32 °C, for seven days then placed into competitive arenas where aggressive interactions were recorded between sized matched individuals within each species. While there was no apparent effect of temperature treatment on aggressive behaviour for P. chrysurus, we observed up to a four-fold increase in aggression scores for P. nagasakiensis with increasing temperature. Results suggest that temperature experienced as juveniles can impact aggressive behaviour; however, species-specific thermal tolerances led to behavioural affects that differ among closely related species. Differential thermal tolerance among species may cause restructuring of the interaction network that underlies the structure of reef assemblages. © 2019 Warren and McCormick.},

abstract={Hypoxia, triggered in large part by eutrophication, exerts widespread and expanding stress on coastal ecosystems. Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations &lt; 2 mg L -1 . However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters. © 2019 Roman, Brandt, Houde and Pierson.},

abstract={Temperature has a profound effect on all life and a particularly influential effect on ectotherms, such as fishes. Amphibious fishes have a variety of strategies, both physiological and/or behavioural, to cope with a broad range of thermal conditions. This study examined the relationship between prolonged (5 weeks) exposure to a range of temperatures (22, 25, 28, or 32 °C) on oxygen uptake rate and movement behaviours (i.e., thermoregulation and emergence) in a common amphibious fish, the barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilneatuis). At the highest temperature examined (32 °C, approximately 5 °C above their summer average temperatures), barred mudskippers exhibited 33.7–97.7% greater oxygen uptake rates at rest (ṀO2Rest), emerged at a higher temperature (CTe; i.e., a modified critical thermal maxima (CTMax) methodology) of 41.3 ± 0.3 °C relative to those maintained at 28, 25, or 22 °C. The 32 °C-maintained fish also ceased movement activity at the highest holding temperature suggesting that prolonged submergence at elevated temperatures is physiologically and energetically stressful to the individual. Using exhaustive exercise protocols with and without air exposure to simulate a predatory chase, the time to recovery was examined for all individuals. When submerged, mudskippers required 2.5x longer recovery time to return to resting oxygen uptake from exhaustive exercise than those fully emerged in air. Oxygen uptake data revealed that air exposure did not accrue oxygen debt, thereby allowing faster return to resting oxygen consumption rates. If the option to emerge was not available, mudskippers preferentially sought more benign water temperatures (26.7 ± 2.1 °C), resembling those experienced by these fish during the Austral autumn, regardless of prolonged exposure higher or lower temperatures. These results add to our understanding of the strategies that amphibious fishes may use to mitigate extra costs associated with living in warm waters, and could be the key to understanding how such species will cope with increasing temperatures in the future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Rising temperatures likely affect the trophic interactions in temperate regions as global warming progresses. An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25°C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={In ectotherms, anthropogenic warming often increases energy requirements for metabolism, which can either impair growth (when resources are limiting) or lead to higher predator feeding rates and possibly stronger top–down trophic interactions. However, the relative importance of these effects in nature remains unclear because: (1) thermal adaptation or acclimation could lower metabolic costs; (2) greater prey production at warmer temperatures could compensate for higher predator feeding rates; and/or (3) temperature effects on trophic interactions via altered biological rates could be small relative to other, temperature-unrelated human impacts on food webs. Here, we examined effects of deforestation-associated warming on the minnow Enteromius neumayeri, occurring in both forested (cool) and deforested (warm) streams located inside or nearby an afrotropical rainforest. Combining approaches from physiological and community ecology, we quantified impacts of anthropogenic warming on the metabolism, growth and trophic interactions of this tropical ectotherm. We then compared these effects with impacts of land use unrelated to temperature. In a long-term laboratory acclimation experiment quantifying the temperature dependence of growth and metabolism in E. neumayeri, warming increased metabolic rates and decreased growth (at a limited ration). We found no evidence of local (thermal) adaptation, with warming affecting farm and forest populations similarly. Then, using mark–recapture methods to quantify impacts of warming on performance in situ, we found similar growth rates in fish from deforested and forested streams despite their distinct thermal environments. This suggests higher prey consumption at deforested sites to compensate for greater metabolic costs, which could strengthen fish–invertebrate interactions. Finally, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate fish–invertebrate interaction strength and quantify temperature-related and unrelated impacts of land use on this interaction. We found that although warming increased fish consumption, it apparently increased invertebrate production even more and thus had a net-weakening effect on estimated interaction strength. Most importantly, variation in both fish and invertebrate density not directly related to temperature had a much stronger influence on estimated interaction strength than temperature effects on predator consumption and prey growth. We conclude that ectotherms can sometimes offset the metabolic costs of warming with a small increase in consumption that hardly effects food web interactions compared to non-metabolic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances. Future research should assess whether this is a common feature of heavily impacted ecosystems facing multiple stressors. A plain language summary is available for this article. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Stable isotopes are valuable tools in physiological and ecological research, as they can be used to estimate diet, habitat use, and resource allocation. However, in most cases a priori knowledge of two key properties of stable isotopes is required, namely their rate of incorporation into the body (incorporation rate) and the change of isotope values between consumers and resources that arises during incorporation of the isotopes into the consumer's tissues (trophic discrimination). Previous studies have quantified these properties across species and tissue types, but little is known about how they vary with temperature, a key driver of many biological rates and times. Here, we explored for the first time how temperature affects both carbon incorporation rate and trophic discrimination via growth rates, using the domestic cricket, Acheta domesticus. We raised crickets at 16 °C, 21 °C, and 26 °C and showed that temperature increased carbon isotope incorporation rate, which was driven by both an increased growth rate and catabolism at higher temperatures. Trophic discrimination of carbon isotopes decreased at higher temperatures, which we attributed to either lower activation energies needed to synthesize non-essential amino acids at higher temperatures or the increased utilization of available resources of consumers at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate that temperature is a key driver of both carbon isotope incorporation rate and trophic discrimination, via mechanisms that likely persist across all ectotherms. Experiments to determine incorporation rates and trophic discrimination factors in ectotherms must include temperature as a major factor, and natural variation in temperature might have significant effects on these isotopic properties that then can affect inferences made from isotope values. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Trophic interactions are important determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Because the metabolism and consumption rates of ectotherms increase sharply with temperature, there are major concerns that global warming will increase the strength of trophic interactions, destabilizing food webs, and altering ecosystem structure and function. We used geothermally warmed streams that span an 11°C temperature gradient to investigate the interplay between temperature-driven selection on traits related to metabolism and resource acquisition, and the interaction strength between the keystone gastropod grazer, Radix balthica, and a common algal resource. Populations from a warm stream (~28°C) had higher maximal metabolic rates and optimal temperatures than their counterparts from a cold stream (~17°C). We found that metabolic rates of the population originating from the warmer stream were higher across all measurement temperatures. A reciprocal transplant experiment demonstrated that the interaction strengths between the grazer and its algal resource were highest for both populations when transplanted into the warm stream. In line with the thermal dependence of respiration, interaction strengths involving grazers from the warm stream were always higher than those with grazers from the cold stream. These results imply that increases in metabolism and resource consumption mediated by the direct, thermodynamic effects of higher temperatures on physiological rates are not mitigated by metabolic compensation in the long term, and suggest that warming could increase the strength of algal–grazer interactions with likely knock-on effects for the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic ecosystems. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Understanding how climatic variation affects animal populations and communities is essential for addressing threats posed by climate change, especially in systems where impacts are projected to be high. We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter–spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%–285% across time, while two larger spring–summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1–1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2–4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (Tmax) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with Tmax were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Ectotherms frequently thermoregulate behaviorally to improve physiological processes such as digestion and growth, but basking and other thermoregulatory activities can also increase predation risk. Organismal and environmental characteristics can, in some species, influence predation risk associated with thermoregulation and thereby relax or tighten constraints on thermoregulatory behavior, physiological performance, and, ultimately, life history traits. Providing one of the first such investigations in turtles, we examine whether behavior and thermal environment modulate a thermoregulation–predation risk trade-off in juvenile gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). Young gopher tortoises experience very high predation pressure, and their declining species faces many challenges, including human-induced increased shading of its environment. We hypothesized that in response to simulated predator approach, basking hatchling and juvenile tortoises would: (i) hide inside burrows; (ii) hide for shorter durations in cooler burrows presumably due to greater constraints on physiological performance; and (iii) spend greater time at the surface following disturbance in cool environments because individuals would need to bask more to maintain preferred body temperatures. Basking tortoises always hid inside burrows when approached and exhibited very long flight initiation distances (x = 45 m) that increased with age/size. Individuals fled into burrows even when it was not possible for them to see the approaching researcher, suggesting the use of vibrations (aerial/ground) to detect potential predators and a possible antipredator function for exceptionally large otoliths characteristic of the species. Tortoises hid for short durations (x = 18.3 min), especially in cool burrows, suggesting that they optimize hiding responses to balance physiological costs and antipredator benefits. Additionally, surface activity following disturbance consisted primarily of basking and correlated negatively with burrow temperature. These findings suggest that thermal environment influences predation risk in ectotherms whose surface activity is driven primarily by thermoregulatory requirements and highlight potential benefits of warm, well-insolated habitats, such as endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems, for juvenile gopher tortoises. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Survival of air-breathing, diving ectotherms is dependent on their capacity to optimise the time available for obligate underwater activities, such as predator avoidance. Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, 'fright' bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28°C, and 'high' climate warming, 34°C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34°C (Q10=7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9±27.8% and 27.8±16.5% (means±s.e.m.) at 28°C and 34°C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive. Together these findings suggest decrements in fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures stem from increased oxygen demand coupled with a reduced capacity for metabolic depression. © 2017.

abstract={In most European freshwater ecosystems, the invasive gammarids Gammarus tigrinus and Dikerogammarus villosus strongly impair recipient communities through predation of a wide range of native invertebrates. Due to the effects of temperature on both the physiology and the behaviour of such ectotherms, understanding how global warming may influence their ecological impact is a research priority. These species were therefore exposed to three different food types to determine their detritivorous, herbivorous and carnivorous characters, and predation was measured characterizing the Holling’s functional response. The effect of increasing water temperatures (15, 20, 25°C) on both the food choice and predatory activities was investigated. Both species showed a significant preference for animal tissues at all temperatures. The total food intake increased with temperature for G. tigrinus but did not change for D. villosus, which may result from specific species differences in metabolic requirements. The consumption of live prey strongly increased with temperature. The main differences were an increased searching efficiency in G. tigrinus and a decreased handling time in D. villosus as temperature increased, which may result from differences in foraging strategies. These results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the predation pressure of both invasive gammarids on prey species. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Prey at risk of predation may experience stress and respond physiologically by altering their metabolic rates. Theory predicts that such physiological changes should alter prey nutrient demands from N-rich to C-rich macronutrients and shift the balance between maintenance and growth/reproduction. Theory further suggests that for ectotherms, temperature stands to exacerbate this stress. Yet, the interactive effects of predation stress and temperature stress on diet, metabolism, and survival of ectotherms are not well known. This knowledge gap was addressed with a laboratory study in which wild juvenile grasshoppers were collected, assigned to one of three groups, and raised at three different temperatures. All grasshoppers had access to equal quantities of two diets composed of opposite carbohydrate : protein ratios. Half of the individuals in each temperature group were exposed to predation risk cues from spider predators, while the other half were kept in risk free conditions. Grasshoppers consumed more carbohydrates when exposed to predation risk, but consumption favored greater protein intake as temperature increased. Moreover, the difference in carbohydrate intake between risk cue and risk free treatments diminished as temperature increased. Furthermore, variability between individual consumption patterns both within and between treatments decreased markedly as temperature increased, suggesting that higher temperatures promote more consistent individual consumption behaviors. Grasshoppers grew faster and larger as temperature increased, which translated into higher survival rates at higher temperatures. Warmer grasshoppers also did not alter their metabolic rates in response to predation risk cues, in contrast to colder grasshoppers. Digestive efficiency increased with temperature as well-further indicating that lower temperatures were much more stressful than higher temperatures for grasshoppers. The study shows that physiological responses of ectothermic herbivores to predation stress are highly plastic and temperature dependent, with higher temperatures promoting increased protein intake, growth, development, survival, and digestive efficiency relative to colder temperatures. These findings help to reconcile why dietary responses (proportion of protein vs. carbohydrate intake) to predation stress may vary among different prey taxa studied previously. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Spawning migrations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to coastal watersheds provide a rich resource subsidy to freshwater consumers. However, variation in thermal regimes and spawning activity across the landscape constrain the ability of poikilothermic consumers to assimilate eggs and carcasses. We investigated how sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) spawning density and stream temperature affect the growth, body condition, and fatty acid composition of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), a known egg predator, in seven tributaries of the Wood River in Southwest Alaska. We compared mean body size of juvenile coho salmon in late summer among 3–7 years per stream and found that the largest mean size occurred in warm streams in which sockeye salmon spawned, although overall subsidy magnitude (spawner density) had no effect on consumer body size. Individuals that consumed more salmon eggs (estimated from δ15N) were larger and had altered fatty acid composition but did not have higher relative body condition. These results indicate that effects of marine subsidies on freshwater consumers depend both on local habitat conditions and on individual variation in energy allocation. © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing.

abstract={Although temperature significantly influences pesticides’ impact on ectotherms, the joint effect of temperature and pesticides on natural enemies is understudied. In laboratory conditions, we investigated the influence of two commonly used insecticides, spinosad and λ-cyhalothrin, on mortality and functional response of a community of Philodromus spiders (P. cespitum 80 %, P. albidus 20 %) at different temperatures (10, 17, 25, and 31 °C). Almost all spiders died at 31 °C in the λ-cyhalothrin treatment. Mortality was very low at other temperatures. Mortality in the spinosad treatment did not differ from the control. Both pesticides reduced the prey capture rate and/or changed the type of functional response at all temperatures. The sublethal effects of λ-cyhalothrin were most pronounced at 10 °C, while those of spinosad were most marked at 10 and 25 °C. At 10 °C, the pesticides’ effects on the spiders were long lasting. In addition, λ-cyhalothrin influenced the philodromids much more negatively than spinosad suggesting its incompatibility with IPM across all temperatures. The results support the importance of studying the temperature-specific effects of pesticides in order to increase the efficiency of integrated pest management. Philodromids are effective in pest suppression at low temperatures, but application of pesticides at the beginning of the season can significantly disrupt their biocontrol potential. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The consumption rate of an ectothermic predator is highly temperature-dependent and is a key driver of pest-predator population interactions. Not only average daily temperature, but also diurnal temperature variations may affect prey consumption and life history traits of ectotherms. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations on body size, predation capacity and oviposition rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) when presented with eggs of their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). For both predators, mean daily temperature as well as temperature alternation had a substantial impact on the number of prey consumed. At lower average temperatures, more eggs were killed under an alternating temperature regime (20 °C/5 °C and 25 °C/10 °C) than at the corresponding mean constant temperatures (15 and 20 °C). At higher average temperatures (>25 °C), however, the opposite was observed with higher numbers of prey killed at constant temperatures than at alternating temperatures. At 25 °C, temperature variation had no effect on the predation capacity. A similar trend as for the predation rates was observed for the oviposition rates of the phytoseiids. Body size of N. californicus was affected both by average daily temperature and temperature variation, with smaller adult females emerging at alternating temperatures than at constant temperatures, whereas for P. persimilis, temperature variation had no impact on its body size. Our results demonstrate that temperature variations are likely to affect biological control of T. urticae by the studied phytoseiid predators. © 2015, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).},

abstract={The impact of daily temperature variations on arthropod life history remains woefully understudied compared to the large body of research that has been carried out on the effects of constant temperatures. However, diurnal varying temperature regimes more commonly represent the environment in which most organisms thrive. Such varying temperature regimes have been demonstrated to substantially affect development and reproduction of ectothermic organisms, generally in accordance with Jensen's inequality. In the present study we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations at 4 amplitudes (DTR0, +5, +10 and +15°C) on the developmental rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). We have modelled their developmental rates as a function of temperature using both linear and non-linear models. Diurnally alternating temperatures resulted in a faster development in the lower temperature range as compared to their corresponding mean constant temperatures, whereas the opposite was observed in the higher temperature range. Our results indicate that Jensen's inequality does not suffice to fully explain the differences in developmental rates at constant and alternating temperatures, suggesting additional physiological responses play a role. It is concluded that diurnal temperature range should not be ignored and should be incorporated in predictive models on the phenology of arthropod pests and their natural enemies and their performance in biological control programmes. © 2015 Vangansbeke et al.},

abstract={Amphibians are important indicators of environmental health, and their populations are in worldwide decline. The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 μg Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22°C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17°). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments. We suggest that increased concentrations of dissolved copper and elevated water temperatures are harmful to amphibian prey through maladaptive behavioral responses in the presence of predators. © 2015 Hayden et al.},

abstract={Understanding how temperature variation influences the negative (e.g. self-limitation) and positive (e.g. saturating functional responses) feedback processes that characterize consumer-resource interactions is an important research priority. Previous work on this topic has yielded conflicting outcomes with some studies predicting that warming should increase consumer-resource oscillations and others predicting that warming should decrease consumer-resource oscillations. Here, I develop a consumer-resource model that both synthesizes previous findings in a common framework and yields novel insights about temperature effects on consumer-resource dynamics. I report three key findings. First, when the resource species' birth rate exhibits a unimodal temperature response, as demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies, the temperature range over which the consumer-resource interaction can persist is determined by the lower and upper temperature limits to the resource species' reproduction. This contrasts with the predictions of previous studies, which assume that the birth rate exhibits a monotonic temperature response, that consumer extinction is determined by temperature effects on consumer species' traits, rather than the resource species' traits. Secondly, the comparative analysis I have conducted shows that whether warming leads to an increase or decrease in consumer-resource oscillations depends on the manner in which temperature affects intraspecific competition. When the strength of self-limitation increases monotonically with temperature, warming causes a decrease in consumer-resource oscillations. However, if self-limitation is strongest at temperatures physiologically optimal for reproduction, a scenario previously unanalysed by theory but amply substantiated by empirical data, warming can cause an increase in consumer-resource oscillations. Thirdly, the model yields testable comparative predictions about consumer-resource dynamics under alternative hypotheses for how temperature affects competitive and resource acquisition traits. Importantly, it does so through empirically quantifiable metrics for predicting temperature effects on consumer viability and consumer-resource oscillations, which obviates the need for parameterizing complex dynamical models. Tests of these metrics with empirical data on a host-parasitoid interaction yield realistic estimates of temperature limits for consumer persistence and the propensity for consumer-resource oscillations, highlighting their utility in predicting temperature effects, particularly warming, on consumer-resource interactions in both natural and agricultural settings. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={The nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predators on prey behavior and physiology can influence the structure and function of ecological communities. However, the strength of NCEs should depend on the physiological and environmental contexts in which prey must choose between food and safety. For ectotherms, temperature effects on metabolism and foraging rates may shape these choices, thereby altering NCE strength. We examined NCEs in a rocky intertidal food chain across a latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient within the Gulf of Maine. The NCEs of green crabs (Carcinus maenas) on the foraging, growth, and growth efficiency of prey snails (Nucella lapillus) were consistent across a broad (~8.5 °C) temperature range, even though snails that were transplanted south consumed twice as many mussels (Mytilus edulis) and grew twice as much as snails that were transplanted north. The positive effects of warmer temperatures in the south allowed snails under high risk to perform similarly to or better than snails under low risk at cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that for prey populations residing at temperatures below their thermal optimum, the positive effects of future warming may offset the negative effects of predation risk. Such effects may be favorable to prey populations facing increased predation rates due to warmer temperatures associated with climate change.

abstract={Ectotherms use specialized behavior to balance amelioration of environmental temperature stress against the need to forage. The intertidal snail Nucella ostrina risks aerial exposure at low tide to feed on the barnacle Balanus glandula. We hypothesized that N. ostrina foraging behavior would be constrained by duration and timing of low tide exposure. We added snails to intertidal blocks on San Juan Island, Washington, USA, and forced them to choose between barnacles placed on the western or eastern face of each block, or to shelter and forgo foraging. Snail behavior and barnacle mortality were monitored daily for 8 wk during summer 2011. N. ostrina foraging peaked every 2 wk, when temperature was minimized by tidal cycling. Low tide timing determined which substrate orientation was coolest and coincided with the proportion of snails foraging on one substrate face or the other: snails foraged on the western faces on days with morning low tides and on eastern faces on days with afternoon low tides. Barnacle consumption rates mirrored this spatiotemporal foraging pattern. Our conceptual model predicted mobile organism presence and location: snails foraged during the days of the tidal cycle least likely to be hot and selected the coolest available surface when foraging. These results suggest that N. ostrina alters foraging behavior to minimize risk of exposure to high temperatures or other emersion stresses. Consequently, predation on barnacles varies over space and time. This spatiotemporal behavior may buffer warming air temperatures and should be considered in models of coastal population and community dynamics. © Inter-Research 2015.},

abstract={The ability to display multiple defensive behaviors may increase the chances of an individual avoiding predation. Morphological and physiological condition often influences the display of particular behaviors. Understanding the factors influencing the display of particular behaviors from a suite of potential behaviors can help understand the conditions under which displaying certain suites of defensive behaviors will confer the greatest advantage. Drymarchon couperi (Eastern Indigo Snake) is a large, non-venomous snake that exhibits multiple visual, auditory, olfactory, and physical defensive behaviors. We studied the responses of wild D. couperi to human capture and examined how the number and presence of individual behaviors were related to extrinsic and intrinsic variables using encounters from 84 snakes. Snakes were more likely to flee from the observer at warmer body temperatures and, once captured, exhibited wide variation in defensive behaviors with less costly (i.e., less aggressive) behaviors predominating. Individuals were more likely to display any type of defensive behavior earlier in the field season (i.e., November through January). However, our variables had relatively little influence on the presence of particular defensive behaviors although, for some behaviors, the probability of displaying a behavior increased as the number of other behaviors exhibited increased. Our study shows that D. couperi defensive behavior is quite variable and that the factors contributing variation are unclear. Environmental factors (e.g., distance to retreat site) or individual predispositions may contribute to some of this variation. © 2015. Javan M. Bauder All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Marine tetrapods represent powerful models for studying how evolutionary transitions shape the life history traits, physiology and behaviour of animals. Whereas adaptations to diving are driven primarily by the need to secure underwater food, diving in the pelagic sea snake, Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus, seems less foraging-dependent. Indeed, this reptile captures fish while floating at the sea surface. Despite knowledge about its surface ecology, its underwater behaviour remains mostly unknown. Yet, study of this life phase is a key to understanding how and why this snake dives. In this study, we reanalysed published data on its diving behaviour. The pelagic sea snake spends 95% of its time underwater, where it can dive to 50. m and stay for 3.5. h without breathing. Dives are S-shaped, with a long phase of gradual ascent during which the snake is neutrally buoyant. Snake lungs deflate slowly during this phase at a rate that increases with water temperature, and thus metabolism. Dive duration is linked to inferred lung volume at the start of the dive, suggesting aerobic diving. We propose that pelagic sea snakes dive for multiple reasons, but primarily to avoid sea surface turbulence. Underwater, they can reduce metabolism by targeting cooler water layers. By hovering in the water column, they reduce energy expenditure and escape both surface and bottom predators, while more easily locating their own prey from underneath. Some marine turtles occasionally display S-shaped dives, but the role of such dives remains under debate. We suggest the study of sea snakes can help interpret diving behaviour in other lineages of marine reptiles. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The strength of interactions between consumers and their resources has important implications for the overall structure and function of food webs. These interactions can change with warming, depending on the foraging mode of the predator. Theory predicts that warming increases foraging velocity in ectotherms, but in a sit-and-wait predator that has zero velocity when foraging, the interaction strength should be temperature independent. Using the protist Urocentrum turbo and the sitand- wait copepod Orthocyclops modestus, we tested this prediction by measuring dynamic interaction strengths (effect of a predator on prey population growth rate) and by estimating the parameters of a functional response. Both of these metrics were consistent with the prediction that interaction strength is temperature independent in a sit-and-wait predator. Our results indicate that there may be considerable variability in how warming alters foraging interactions, and estimating the overall effects of climate change on food webs may require consideration of the distribution of foraging strategies and the potential asymmetries that arise with interactions that involve different strategies. © 2014 Novich et al.},

abstract={A rise in temperature will intensify the feeding links involving ectotherms in food webs. However, it is unclear how the effects will quantitatively differ between the plant-herbivore and herbivore-carnivore interface. To test how warming could differentially affect rates of herbivory and carnivory, we studied trophic interaction strength in a food chain comprised of green algae, herbivorous rotifers and carnivorous rotifers at 10, 15, 20 and 25°C. We found significant warming-induced changes in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous rotifers, but these responses occurred at different parts of the entire temperature gradient. The strongest response of the per capita herbivore's ingestion rate occurred due to an increase in temperature from 15 to 20°C (1.9 fold: from 834 to 1611 algal cells per h-1) and of the per capita carnivore's ingestion rate from 20 to 25°C (1.6 fold: from 1.5 to 2.5 prey h-1). Handling time, an important component of a consumer's functional response, significantly decreased from 15 to 20°C in herbivorous rotifers. In contrast, it decreased from 20 to 25°C in carnivorous rotifers. Attack rates significantly and strongly increased from 10 to 25°C in the herbivorous animals, but not at all in the carnivores. Our results exemplify how the relative forces of top-down control exerted by herbivores and carnivores may strongly shift under global warming. But warming, and its magnitude, are not the only issue: If our results would prove to be representative, shifts in ectotherm interactions will quantitatively differ when a 5°C increase starts out from a low, intermediate or high initial temperature. This would imply that warming could have different effects on the relative forces of carnivory and herbivory in habitats differing in average temperature, as would exist at different altitudes and latitudes. © 2014 Seifert et al.},

abstract={Predicted universal responses of ectotherms to climate warming include increased maximum population growth rate and changes in body size through the temperature-size rule. However, the mechanisms that would underlie these predicted responses are not clear. Many studies have focused on proximate mechanisms of physiological processes affecting individual growth. One can also consider ultimate mechanisms involving adaptive explanations by evaluating temperature effects on different vital rates across the life history and using the information in a population dynamical model. Here, we combine long-term data for a top predator in freshwater ecosystems (pike; Esox lucius) with a stochastic integral projection model to analyze concurrent effects of temperature on vital rates, body size, and population dynamics. As predicted, the net effect of warming on population growth rate (fitness) is positive, but the thermal sensitivity of this rate is highly size- and vital rate-dependent. These results are not sensitive to increasing variability in temperature. Somatic growth follows the temperature-size rule, and our results support an adaptive explanation for this response. The stable length structure of the population shifts with warming toward an increased proportion of medium-sized but a reduced proportion of small and large individuals. This study highlights how demographic approaches can help reveal complex underlying mechanisms for population responses to warming. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Predation risk has strong effects on organismal physiology that can cascade to impact ecosystem structure and function. Physiological processes in general are sensitive to temperature. Thus, the temperature at which predators and prey interact may shape physiological response to predation risk. We measured and evaluated how temperature and predation risk affected growth rates of predaceous damselfly nymphs (Enallagma vesperum, Odonata: Coenagrionidae). First, we conducted growth trials at five temperatures crossed with two levels of predation risk (fish predator present versus absent) and measured growth rates, consumption rates, assimilation efficiencies, and production efficiencies of 107 individual damselflies. Second, we used a model to evaluate if and how component physiological responses to predation risk affected growth rates across temperatures. In the absence of mortality threat, growth rates of damselflies increased with warming until about 23.5 °C and then began to decline, a typical unimodal response to changes in temperature. Under predation risk, growth rates were lower and the shape of the thermal response was less apparent. Higher metabolic and survival costs induced by predation risk were only partially offset by changes in consumption rates and assimilation efficiencies and the magnitude of non-consumptive effects varied as a function of temperature. Furthermore, we documented that thermal physiology was mediated by predation risk, a known driver of organismal physiology that occurs in the context of species interactions. A general understanding of climatic impacts on ectothermic populations requires consideration of the community context of thermal physiology, including non-consumptive effects of predators. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Bergmann's rule-an increase in body size with latitude-correlates with latitudinal declines in ambient temperature and predation risk, but relatively few studies simultaneously explore the relative importance of these factors. Along temperate Atlantic shorelines, the isopod Idotea balthica from high latitudes are 53% longer on average than isopods from low latitudes. When reared at 6°-24° C, juveniles increased growth and development rates with temperature. Because the increase in growth rate with temperature outstripped increases in development rate, female size at maturity increased with temperature. This thermal sensitivity of growth cannot account for the latitudinal pattern in body size. Within temperature treatments, females from low latitudes reached sexual maturity at younger ages and at a smaller size than did females from higher latitudes. This shift in life-history strategy is predicted by latitudinal declines in predation pressure, which we tested using field-tethering experiments. Overall, isopods at low latitudes had a 44% greater mortality risk from daytime predators relative to isopods at higher latitudes. We conclude that a latitudinal gradient in predation risk, not temperature, is principally responsible for Bergmann's rule in I. balthica. Increases in body size during future warming of oceans may be constrained by local patterns of predation risk. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feedbacks at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Climate change is one of the most important factors affecting the phenology, distribution, composition and diversity of organisms. In agricultural systems many pests and natural enemies are arthropods. As poikilotherm organisms, their body temperature is highly dependent on environmental conditions. Because higher trophic levels typically have lower tolerance to high temperatures than lower trophic levels, trends towards increasing local or regional temperatures may affect the strength of predator/prey interactions and disrupt pest control. Furthermore, increasing temperatures may create climate corridors that could facilitate the invasion and establishment of invasive species originating from warmer areas. In this study we examined the effect of environmental conditions on the dynamics of an agro-ecosystem community located in southern Spain, using field data on predator/prey dynamics and climate gathered during four consecutive years. The study system was composed of an ever-green tree species (avocado), an exotic tetranychid mite, and two native species of phytoseiid mites found in association with this new pest. We also present a climatological analysis of the temperature trend in the area of study during the last 28 years, as evidence of temperature warming occurring in the area. We found that the range of temperatures with positive per capita growth rates was much wider in prey than in predators, and that relative humidity contributed to explain the growth rate variation in predators, but not in prey. Predator and prey differences in thermal performance curves could explain why natural enemies did not respond numerically to the pest when environmental conditions were harsh. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Temperature is one of the most important environmental parameters influencing all the biological processes and functions of poikilothermic organisms. Although extensive research has been carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature on animal life histories and to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds as well as the optimal temperatures for survival, development, and reproduction, few studies have investigated links between thermal window, metabolism, and trophic interactions such as predation. We developed models and conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how temperature influences predator-prey interaction strengths (i. e., functional response) using a ladybeetle larva feeding on aphid prey. As predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology, we found that handling time exponentially decreases with warming, but-in contrast with this theory-search rate follows a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. An examination of the model reveals that temperature thresholds for predation depend mainly on search rate, suggesting that predation rate is primarily determined by searching activities and secondly by prey handling. In contrast with prior studies, our model shows that per capita short-term predator-prey interaction strengths and predator energetic efficiency (per capita feeding rate relative to metabolism) generally increase with temperature, reach an optimum, and then decrease at higher temperatures. We conclude that integrating the concept of thermal windows in short- and long-term ecological studies would lead to a better understanding of predator-prey population dynamics at thermal limits and allow better predictions of global warming effects on natural ecosystems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Environmental factors are known to modify the life history of marine ectotherms. In a 16-month laboratory experiment, we investigated the influence of temperature and presence of predators on life-history parameters including shell growth, survival and the energy investment in reproduction and body mass of the short-lived (2-3 years) scallop Argopecten ventricosus. In parallel, A. ventricosus was maintained in the field at the Pacific coast of Baja California, México, to compare growth, survival and reproductive effort under natural conditions. For the laboratory treatments, scallops were reared at simulated field temperatures (SFT), 5°C above SFT and in the presence of predators. Elevated water temperatures caused higher growth and gonad production, although at the cost of increased mortality. Presence of predators induced energy allocation to muscle rather than gonad growth, deferred spawning and extended survival. Field scallops exhibited higher growth, higher reproductive investment and were able to reproduce twice, whereas all laboratory scallops died after the first spawning.

abstract={Fast growth can be costly, so trade-offs between growth and fitness are to be predicted when organisms adjust their growth to compensate for earlier environmental conditions. We developed four generic models of increasing complexity with different processes to predict the indeterminate growth of vertebrate ectotherms, which is sensitive to ambient temperature even when food is not limiting. We contrast the predictions of the models with observed experimental data on growth trajectories, feeding activity, and reproductive investment of three-spined sticklebacks and inferred patterns of accumulation of biomolecular damage arising from activity and growth. All models predicted observed patterns of compensatory growth (both accelerating and decelerating) in response to earlier temperature perturbations, but the more complex models provided the best fit to experimental data. Growth trajectories influenced future reproductive investment regardless of final body size at breeding. Our findings suggest that while models with fewer parameters can predict basic patterns of growth in stable conditions, they cannot capture the costly long-term effects of deviations from steady growth trajectories. In contrast, models in which foraging activity is assumed to carry costs are capable of predicting the complex patterns of feeding, growth, and reproductive investment seen in animals, with the cost of a heightened mortality risk (e.g., through predation) being more important than the cost of increased physiological damage. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Behavioural, morphological and coloration plasticity are common responses of prey to predation risk. Theory predicts that prey should respond to the relative magnitude of risk, rather than a single level of response to any risk level. In addition to conspecific and predator densities, prey growth and differentiation rates affect the duration of vulnerability to size and stage-limited predators and therefore the relative value of defences. We reared tadpoles of the Neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus with or without cues from a predator (Belostoma sp.) in ecologically relevant warm or cool temperatures. To track phenotypic changes, we measured morphology, tail coloration and developmental stage at three points during the larval period. Cues from predators interacted with growth conditions causing tadpoles to alter their phenotype, changing only tail colour in response to predators in warm water, but both morphology and colour in cool growth conditions. Tadpoles with predators in warm water altered coloration early but converged on the morphology of predator-free controls. Water temperature alone had no effect on tadpole phenotype. We demonstrate that seemingly small variation in abiotic environmental conditions can alter the expression of phenotypic plasticity, consistent with predictions about how growth rate affects risk. Predator-induced tadpole phenotypes depended on temperature, with strong expression only in temperatures that slow development. Thermal modulation of plastic responses to predators may be broadly relevant to poikilotherm development. It is important to include a range of realistic growth conditions in experiments to more fully understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of plasticity. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Temperature influences almost all life-history traits. For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23°C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18°C and 28°C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (∼30°C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through bodytemperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={In organisms with complex life cycles, environmentally induced plasticity across sequential stages can have important consequences on morphology and life history traits such as developmental and growth rates. However, previous research in amphibians and other ectothermic vertebrates suggests that some morphological traits are generally insensitive to environmental inductions. We conducted a literature survey to examine the allometric responses in relative hind leg length and head shape of post-metamorphic anuran amphibians to induced environmental (temperature, resource level, predation and desiccation risk) variation operating during the larval phase in 44 studies using 19 species. To estimate and compare plastic responses across studies, we employed both an index of plasticity and effect sizes from a meta-analysis. We found contrasting trait responses to different environmental cues. Higher temperatures increased development more than growth rate and induced smaller heads but not overall shifts in hind leg length. In contrast, an increment in resource availability increased growth more than development, with a parallel increase in hind leg length but no change in head shape. Increases in predation risk decreased both development and growth rates and slightly reduced relative hind leg length, but there was no change in head shape. Pond desiccation induced quick development and low growth rates, with no changes in morphology. Across environments, both hind leg and head shape plasticity were positively correlated with growth rate plasticity. However, plasticity of developmental rate was only correlated with head shape plasticity. Overall, these results suggest that environmental trends predicted by global warming projections, such as increasing pond temperature and accelerating pond desiccation, will significantly influence hind leg and head morphology in metamorphic frogs, which may affect performance and, ultimately, fitness. © Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract={In various ectotherms, it is well-known that high-latitude individuals grow faster at any temperature than do low-latitude individuals as an adaptation to shorter growing seasons. The submaximal growth of low-latitude ectotherms implies that there exist trade-offs with fast growth. Although there is accumulating evidence for latitudinal variation in growth capacity, however, few studies have demonstrated these trade-offs. In this study, using a freshwater fish Oryzias latipes as a model organism, we tested whether there is an acquisition trade-off in which the higher growth capacity of high-latitude individuals is realized by foraging more intensively, despite the risk of predation. Foraging experiments revealed that higher-latitude O. latipes juveniles captured more prey per unit time than lower-latitude juveniles at any temperature. In addition, predation experiments revealed that higher-latitude juveniles were more frequently killed by dragonfly larvae. Observations of swimming behaviors demonstrated that the higher vulnerability to predation in high-latitude O. latipes is probably caused by lower steady- and burst-swimming performances due to the larger meal size, and partially by reduced caution due to a greater willingness to forage. We conclude that acquisition trade-offs may be the primary constraint on growth evolution across latitudes among fishes. This implies that growth capacity evolves in response not only to the length of the growing season but also to predation pressures. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Temperature has strong, predictable effects on metabolism. Through this mechanism, environmental temperature affects individuals and populations of poikilotherms by determining rates of resource use, growth, reproduction, and mortality. Predictable variation in metabolic processes such as growth and reproduction could affect the strength of species interactions, but the community-level consequences of metabolic temperature dependence are virtually unexplored. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that plantherbivore interaction strength increases with temperature using a common species of marine macroalga (Sargassum filipendula) and the grazing amphipod Ampithoe longimana. Increasing temperature increased per capita interaction strength in two independent experiments and reversed a positive effect of temperature on plant growth. Temperature did not alter palatability of plant tissue to herbivores or average herbivore feeding rate. A predictable effect of temperature on herbivore-plant interaction strength could provide key information toward understanding local food web responses to changing temperatures at different spatial and temporal scales. Efforts to extend the effects of physiological mechanisms to larger scale patterns, including projections of the ecological effects of climate change, must be expanded to include the effects of changing conditions on trophic interactions. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={1. All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey. 2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey. 3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 °C). 4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons. The ability of many carabid beetles to forage at low temperatures may have nutritional benefits and increases the diversity of interactions in terrestrial food webs. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Birds and mammals are the leading marine predators at high latitudes, while sharks and other large fish occupy top positions in tropical waters. The present study proposes that temperature-dependent predation success (TPS) explains global patterns of marine vertebrate community structure. Burst speed increases with temperature in ectotherms but is independent of temperature in endotherms. If capture success depends on relative swimming speeds of predator and prey, ectothermic prey will be more vulnerable to attack by endothermic predators at low temperatures. Conversely, high temperatures should enhance the ability of ectothermic predators to prey on endotherms. Pursuit-diving seabirds (penguins, auks and some cormorants) and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) are ubiquitous in ocean waters with summer surface temperatures cooler than the midteens to low 20s (°C) but are virtually absent in warmer regions. We suggest that the near-absence of these animals at low latitudes is due to TPS, as warm water increases the difficulty of capturing fish prey and increases vulnerability to predation by large ectothermic and partially endothermic sharks. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are virtually absent from warm temperate and tropical waters, even where primary productivity and fisheries data suggest that food supplies are ample. This indicates that the low productivity that prevails in much of the tropical zone cannot explain the worldwide distributional patterns of pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds. Endothermy in marine communities increases with cooler temperatures and with animal size. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are sensitive to temperature limits and may suffer important range contractions as oceans warm. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={The diet and prey selection of the Southern Grey Shrike (Lanius meridionalis koenigi) was studied in one of the scarce insular environments where it is present, the xeric coastal area of Tenerife (Canary Islands). The main aim of this study was to compare the general trophic patterns with respect to continental populations of Northern Grey Shrike (Lanius excubitor) and Southern Grey Shrike. The material analysed consisted in 440 pellets collected during the four seasons of the year in the period April 2003-March 2004. A total of 5,112 prey items were identified, 85.4% corresponding to beetles (mainly Curculionidae and Tenebrionidae) and the rest consisted of other arthropods and vertebrates. Biomass mainly constituted of vertebrates, especially lizards (64.0%). Slight seasonal variations in diet were recorded, beetles and lizards being highly consumed in all seasons. A positive selection of some beetles, non-Formicidae Hymenoptera and Orthoptera (Schistocerca gregaria) was observed. The data obtained in the present study confirms the hypothesis of how the Southern Grey Shrike relies on cold-blooded prey in hot climate (e.g. south of France), while the Great Grey Shrike mainly relies on warm-blooded prey in cold climate (e.g. Scandinavian Peninsula). The importance of lizards in the diet of this insular shrike population could be related to three different ecological factors: (1) the high abundance of these ectotherm vertebrates in island environments, (2) the higher effectiveness of predation and (3) lower investment of energy to capture them.},

abstract={In the early 1800s, the British physician John Davy provided the first insight that tunas were different from other fish. He made measurements showing that tunas were not cold-blooded, as all fishes were assumed to be at that time. In a paper read to the Royal Society of London in 1835, he reported the remarkable fact that deep muscle temperature in a skipjack tuna (Katsuwonis pelamis) was 10 degrees Celsius higher than the warm tropical water in which the fish was captured. Since then, many investigators have documented warm temperatures in muscle and viscera of other tunas. Sharks of the Lamnidae family, such as makos and whites, are now also known to have regional endothermy. This parallel between tunas and the sharks of this family, called lamnid sharks, is just one of the many anatomical and physiological specializations shared by these two groups of highly active pelagic predators. The evolutionary convergence between them is so striking that in many ways these distantly related groups resemble each other more than they resemble their own close ectothermic relatives. Such similarity is more remarkable considering that these features evolved independently, long after the ancestors of bony and cartilagenous fishes diverged more than 400 million years ago. The shared characteristics in these distantly related groups, which distinguish them from virtually all other fishes, probably arose roughly 40 million to 60 million years ago from similar selection pressures for fast and continuous locomotion.},

abstract={1. Do thermal factors influence foraging-site selection by ectothermic predators? Snake species that obtain their prey from ambush must remain immobile for long periods, precluding overt behavioural thermoregulation; and some "ambush" snakes use thermal cues to detect endothermic prey. Plausibly, alternative ambush sites might differ either in equilibrial body temperatures available to snakes, or in the thermal "background" against which prey items must be detected. 2. We examined this topic with field data on pit-vipers (Gloydius shedaoensis) on a small island in northeastern China. Adult snakes feed only on migrating passerine birds. The snakes ambush birds both from arboreal perches (branches of small trees) and from the ground. 3. Arboreal versus terrestrial ambush sites differed both in operative temperatures and thermal "backgrounds" available to the snakes. Operative temperatures inside copper models were lower in trees than on the ground (because of wind), and snakes in arboreal ambush sites were cooler than those in terrestrial sites. Thermal backgrounds from arboreal perches were cooler (and thus, provided more contrast against prey items) than did backgrounds available from terrestrial ambush-sites. 4. Thermal factors thus modify the suitability of alternative ambush locations for these pit-vipers, but with a trade-off: a snake in a tree can "see" its prey more clearly, but may not be warm enough (and hence, able to strike fast enough) to capture it. Further work is required to determine whether or not snakes actually use such thermal differences as criteria for the selection of ambush sites. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We examined correlations between local climatic conditions, body temperature and activity in adult, basking lowland copperheads (Austrelaps superbus) from two localities (warm-temperate versus cool-temperate) in south-eastern Australia. We also collected data from highland copperheads (Austrelaps ramsayi) at a locality with cold-temperate climate. We found that across the active season, mean body temperatures were similar among localities (approximately 27°C) irrespective of species. In contrast, activity times differed. Cool-temperate A. superbus emerged earlier in spring and in the morning and retreated earlier in the evening and in autumn than their conspecifics from the warm-temperate locality. Spring emergence was correlated with yearly fluctuation in thermal conditions, suggesting that activity times depend on environmental temperatures. Predator-prey interactions influenced body temperature and activity to some extent in spring when warm-temperate A. superbus with relatively low body temperatures (as low as 18.5°C) were captured around ponds in which they had been foraging for frogs. Austrelaps ramsayi from the cold-temperate locality not only displayed a later emergence in spring and reduced daily activity times compared with warm and cool-temperate A. superbus but also compared with A. ramsayi, as reported from a warmer locality in eastern Australia. These data indicate that activity times vary on a geographic basis while snake body temperatures largely remain inflexible. The surprising exception was that cold-temperate A. ramsayi retreated later in autumn than cool-temperate A. superbus, and at that time they showed body temperatures as low as 12.5°C, well below those we had recorded for A. superbus. We suggest that A. ramsayi retreat later in autumn because they need to extend their reproductive season and that this is mediated via adaptive changes in the critical minimum body temperature, as has been reported for other snakes.},

abstract={1. Tiger beetles (Cicindela) of open habitats have served as model ectotherms in studies of the dependence of activity and habitat utilization on temperature. Potential departures from the cicindela model were investigated in Cicindela sexguttata, a species inhabiting forests where thermal resources are patchy and ephemeral. 2. Body temperatures (T(b)) were determined by inserting thermocouples into beetles immediately after observing specific behaviours in the field. Cicindela sexguttata elevated T(b) by basking, foraged at a preferred T(b) of 32.8 °C, and stilted, sun-faced, or sought shade when T(b) exceeded 35 °C. Although these behaviours were typical of Cicindela, their set points were lower than those of species in more open habitats. 3. Illuminated substrates were utilized for basking and foraging. Beetles were dispersed throughout the forest floor in early spring, but became aggregated in light gaps when the canopy leafed out. Operative temperatures of thermal models indicated that beetles were unable to maintain the preferred T(b) in shade and would not be able to maintain a preferred T(b) in light gaps during the autumn, when adults are normally in diapause. 4. Beetles were confined to foraging in light gaps once the canopy was closed. Foraging rate and searching speed were independent of T(b), in contrast to other cicindelids. Adults rarely searched for prey, but ambushed small arthropods that alighted in the light gap. Dependence on patches of illumination as thermal resources may increase prey capture, intraspecific encounters, and risk of predation, and preclude foraging in the autumn when Cicindela species of open habitats are also active.},

abstract={Many studies of high-performance fishes focus on tunas because they are morphologically adapted for efficient swimming, they migrate long distances and accelerate rapidly, and they successfully exploit the epipelagic marine environment. Tunas have also received attention because, by conserving metabolically generated heat, they elevate the temperature of certain tissues above ambient water temperature; that is, they are endothermic. However, few studies have used phylogenetically based comparisons to determine what is unique about tunas and to elucidate evolutionary trends. This paper compares tunas with their closest relatives, ectothermic fishes of the family Scombridae, and examines characteristics of the myotomal musculature that are related to swimming performance. White muscle anaerobic capacity is significantly greater in tunas than in ectothermic scombrid fishes, indicating that energy generation for bursts may be greater in tunas. Because tunas have high capacities to buffer metabolic acids within the white muscle and blood, and to recover from exhaustive exercise rapidly, they may be able to burst repeatedly. The white muscle of tunas also has a higher aerobic capacity than that of ectothermic scombrids, which may indicate that at least some tuna white muscle fibers are recruited at sustainable speeds or it may be related to rapid lactate turnover or growth rates. In contrast, many intracellular characteristics of the red myotomal muscle do not differ significantly between tunas and ectothermic scombrid fishes. Many of these, including mitochondrial ATP production rate and muscle contraction speed, are temperature dependent and are higher at the higher in vivo red muscle temperatures of tunas. Thus, endothermy may result in elevated aerobic performance levels in tunas, and their high blood hemoglobin concentrations, muscle myoglobin contents, and red muscle capillary densities would ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the active, warm red muscle fibers. However, direct tests of this hypothesis are needed. Much more remains to be learned about tunas and ectothermic scombrids so that more complete phylogenetic analyses can be used to understand the adaptive strategies that have resulted in tunas' success as active epipelagic predators.},

abstract={As aquatic vertebrates increase in size, hydrofoils, which use lift to generate thrust, are increasingly used as propulsors. One factor affecting the magnitude of the lift force is the area of the propulsor. Resistance to cruising and sprints is mainly due to drag, but inertia is important during maneuvers when animals accelerate or turn. The inertia of the body and entrained water, which is proportional to body volume, resists acceleration. Because a thrust that is proportional to surface area is used to maneuver a resistance that is proportional to volume, acceleration performance and maneuverability are expected to decline with increasing size. This trend is ame liorated to some extent by the high swimming speeds attainable by warm-bodied vertebrates and the reduced resistance to acceleration characteristic of the skeletons of dolphins and ichthyosaurs. Maneuvers are essential for capture of elusive prey and avoidance of predators. As they increase in size, aquatic vertebrates use various means to ensure that their prey are less maneuverable than they. These include consumption of increasingly smaller prey relative to predator body size (cul minating in filter feeding by the largest aquatic vertebrates); behaviors to concentrate, disturb, and disorient prey; and ambushing or suction feeding that avoid whole-body acceleration. Advantages of warm muscles are seen in the ability of endotherms to take more maneuverable prey than can ectotherms of the same size. Young stages of large aquatic vertebrates could be especially vulnerable to predators; viviparity or spawning in productive patches provides for rapid growth through vulnerable stages. © 1990 by the American fisheries society.},
