However, the effects of an important trait—predator foraging strategy—are largely unknown. We investigated the interactions between predator foraging strategy and temperature on two ectotherm predators: an active predator, the backswimmer Notonecta undulata, and a sit-and-wait predator, the damselfly Enallagma annexum. In a series of predator–prey experiments across a temperature gradient, we measured predator feeding rates on an active prey species, zooplankton Daphnia pulex, predator growth rates, and mechanisms that influence predator feeding: body speed of predators and prey (here measured as swimming speed), prey encounter rates, capture success, attack rates, and handling time. Overall, warming led to increased feeding rates for both predators through changes to each component of the predator’s functional response. We found that prey swimming speed strongly increased with temperature. The active predator’s swimming speed also increased with temperature, and together, the increase in predator and prey swimming speed resulted in twofold higher prey encounter rates for the active predator at warmer temperatures. By contrast, prey encounter rates of the sit-and-wait predator increased fourfold with rising temperatures as a result of increased prey swimming speed. Concurrently, increased prey swimming speed was associated with a decline in the active predator’s capture success at high temperatures, whereas the sit-and-wait predator’s capture success slightly increased with temperature. We provide some of the first evidence that foraging traits mediate the indirect effects of warming on predator performance. Understanding how traits influence species’ responses to warming could clarify how climate change will affect entire functional groups of species. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America",NA,"10.1002/ecy.3146",NA,NA,"0012-9658","1939-9170",32726861,"WOS:000562303400001",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,"ARTICLE","Ecology","11",NA,"cited By 0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089782262&doi=10.1002%2fecy.3146&partnerID=40&md5=a24af645570371162e4d26e01fd6a7b7","Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI  48824, United States; Program in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Behavior, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI  48824, United States; Department of Biology, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA  23187, United States; Department of Integrative Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI  48824, United States","climate change;  freshwater food web;  functional traits;  Holling Type 2 functional response;  hunting mode;  metabolic theory of ecology;  predation","1010055","Archer, L.C., Sohlström, E.H., Gallo, B., Jochum, M., Woodward, G., Kordas, R.L., Rall, B.C., O’Gorman, E.J., Consistent temperature dependence of functional response parameters and their use in predicting population abundance (2019) Journal of Animal Ecology, 88, pp. 1670-1683; Barton, B.T., Beckerman, A.P., Schmitz, O.J., Climate warming strengthens indirect interactions in an old-field food web (2009) Ecology, 90, pp. 2346-2351; Barton, B.T., Schmitz, O.J., Experimental warming transforms multiple predator effects in a grassland food web: Warming and multiple predator effects (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 1317-1325; Bolker, B., (2008) Ecological models and data in R, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA; Brown, J.H., Gillooly, J.F., Allen, A.P., Savage, V.M., West, G.B., Toward a metabolic theory of ecology (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1771-1789; Culler, L.E., McPeek, M.A., Ayres, M.P., Predation risk shapes thermal physiology of a predaceous damselfly (2014) Oecologia, 176, pp. 653-660; Dell, A.I., Pawar, S., Savage, V.M., Systematic variation in the temperature dependence of physiological and ecological traits (2011) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108, pp. 10591-10596; Dell, A.I., Pawar, S., Savage, V.M., Temperature dependence of trophic interactions are driven by asymmetry of species responses and foraging strategy (2014) Journal of Animal Ecology, 83, pp. 70-84; Englund, G., Öhlund, G., Hein, C.L., Diehl, S., Temperature dependence of the functional response: Temperature dependence of consumption (2011) Ecology Letters, 14, pp. 914-921; Fischer, S., Oberhummer, E., Cunha-Saraiva, F., Gerber, N., Taborsky, B., Smell or vision?

Previous studies have shown temperature-driven shifts in herbivore consumption rates and resource preference, but these effects remain poorly understood for predatory arthropods. Here, we investigate how predator killing rates, prey mass consumption, and macronutrient intake respond to increased temperatures using a laboratory and a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Ectothermic predators, wolf spiders (Pardosa sp.), in the lab experiment, were exposed to increased temperatures and different prey macronutrient content (high lipid/low protein and low lipid/high protein) to assess changes in their killing rates and nutritional demands. Additionally, we investigate prey mass and lipid consumption by spiders under contrasting temperatures, along an elevation gradient. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment between low (420 masl; 26°C) and high (2,100 masl; 15°C) elevations in the Ecuadorian Andes, using wild populations of two common orb-weaver spider species (Leucauge sp. and Cyclosa sp.) present along the elevation gradient. We found that killing rates of wolf spiders increased with warmer temperatures but were not significantly affected by prey macronutrient content, although spiders consumed significantly more lipids from lipid-rich prey. The field reciprocal transplant experiment showed no consistent predator responses to changes in temperature along the elevational gradient. Transplanting Cyclosa sp. spiders to low- or high-elevation sites did not affect their prey mass or lipid consumption rate, whereas Leucauge sp. individuals increased prey mass consumption when transplanted from the high to the low warm elevation. Our findings show that increases in temperature intensify predator killing rates, prey consumption, and lipid intake, but the responses to temperature vary between species, which may be a result of species-specific differences in their hunting behavior and sensitivity to temperature. © 2020 The Authors.

While the detrimental effects of summer heat waves have been widely studied, little is known about the impacts of winter warming on marine species in temperate regions. Many species benefit from low winter temperature-induced reductions in metabolism, as these permit conservation of energy reserves that are needed to support reproduction in spring. Here, we used a unique outdoor mesocosm system to expose a coastal predator-prey system, the sea starAsteriasand the blue musselMytilus, to different winter warming scenarios under near-natural conditions. We found that the body condition of mussels decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. Sea star growth also decreased with increasing temperature, which was a function of unaltered predation rates and decreased mussel body condition.Asteriasrelative digestive gland mass strongly declined over the studied temperature interval (catwofold). This could have severe implications for reproductive capacity in the following spring, as digestive glands provide reserve compounds to maturing gonads. Thus, both predator and prey suffered from a mismatch of energy acquisition versus consumption in warmer winter scenarios, with pronounced consequences for food web energy transfer in future oceans.",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2020.0970",NA,NA,"0962-8452","1471-2954",32673558,"WOS:000553111800006",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"savedrecs_definitivo.txt",1,"selected","duplicata?"

When exposed to colder temperatures, ectotherms develop more slowly, but mature at larger body sizes and vice versa at higher temperatures. We investigated whether a phytoseiid predatory mite can obtain a larger body size by rearing it at a low temperature and how the increased body size affected predatory performance on its natural prey. Therefore, we allowed the predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to develop at either 15 or 25 °C. RESULTS: A. limonicus reared at 15 °C had a 6% larger body size than those reared at 25 °C. Larger predators showed higher predation rates on first instars of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), with 9.6 instars/female/day and 8.5 instars/female/day, for larger and standard-sized females, respectively. After three generations reared at 15 °C, body size did not increase any further. When reared for five generations at 15 °C, larger A. limonicus females demonstrated a better ability to subdue second-instar F. occidentalis. CONCLUSION: Low juvenile rearing temperatures may result in phytoseiid predators with a predator/prey size benefit that could improve their biological control function. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",NA,"10.1002/ps.5713",NA,NA,"1526-498X","1526-4998",31825551,"WOS:000504505800001",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,3,3,0,1,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,"ARTICLE","Pest Management Science","5","1841-1846","cited By 3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077359367&doi=10.1002%2fps.5713&partnerID=40&md5=02f7952be0a779488f9b3ee207529c85","Laboratory of Agrozoology, Department of Plants & Crops, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; R&D Department, Biobest Group N.V., Westerlo, Belgium; PCS-Ornamental Plant Research, Destelbergen, Belgium","biological control;  phenotypic plasticity;  Phytoseiidae;  predation rate","Agentschap Innoveren en OndernemenAgentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen, VLAIO funding_text 1={This research was supported by project number 090931 from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT‐Vlaanderen), currently Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship (VLAIO).","Via, S., Gomulkiewicz, R., De Jong, G., Scheiner, S.M., Schlichting, C.D., Van Tienderen, P.H., Adaptive phenotypic plasticity: consensus and controversy (1995) Trends Ecol Evol, 10, pp. 212-217; Sultan, S.E., Phenotypic plasticity for plant development, function and life history (2000) Trends Plant Sci, 5, pp. 537-542; West-Eberhard, M.J., Phenotypic accommodation: adaptive innovation due to developmental plasticity (2005) J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol, 304, pp. 610-618; Agrawal, A.A., Phenotypic plasticity in the interactions and evolution of species (2001) Science, 294, pp. 321-326; Atkinson, D., Temperature and organism size—a biological law for ectotherms?

Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20°C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P. fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F. candida, but killed F. candida when P. fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved. © 2018 The Authors.

However, the relative importance of these effects in nature remains unclear because: (1) thermal adaptation or acclimation could lower metabolic costs; (2) greater prey production at warmer temperatures could compensate for higher predator feeding rates; and/or (3) temperature effects on trophic interactions via altered biological rates could be small relative to other, temperature-unrelated human impacts on food webs. Here, we examined effects of deforestation-associated warming on the minnow Enteromius neumayeri, occurring in both forested (cool) and deforested (warm) streams located inside or nearby an afrotropical rainforest. Combining approaches from physiological and community ecology, we quantified impacts of anthropogenic warming on the metabolism, growth and trophic interactions of this tropical ectotherm. We then compared these effects with impacts of land use unrelated to temperature. In a long-term laboratory acclimation experiment quantifying the temperature dependence of growth and metabolism in E. neumayeri, warming increased metabolic rates and decreased growth (at a limited ration). We found no evidence of local (thermal) adaptation, with warming affecting farm and forest populations similarly. Then, using mark–recapture methods to quantify impacts of warming on performance in situ, we found similar growth rates in fish from deforested and forested streams despite their distinct thermal environments. This suggests higher prey consumption at deforested sites to compensate for greater metabolic costs, which could strengthen fish–invertebrate interactions. Finally, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate fish–invertebrate interaction strength and quantify temperature-related and unrelated impacts of land use on this interaction. We found that although warming increased fish consumption, it apparently increased invertebrate production even more and thus had a net-weakening effect on estimated interaction strength. Most importantly, variation in both fish and invertebrate density not directly related to temperature had a much stronger influence on estimated interaction strength than temperature effects on predator consumption and prey growth. We conclude that ectotherms can sometimes offset the metabolic costs of warming with a small increase in consumption that hardly effects food web interactions compared to non-metabolic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances. Future research should assess whether this is a common feature of heavily impacted ecosystems facing multiple stressors. A plain language summary is available for this article. © 2018 The Authors.

An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25°C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption. © 2016, The Author(s).",NA,"10.1007/s10750-016-2891-7",NA,NA,"0018-8158","1573-5117",NA,"WOS:000426783400011",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,16,16,0,16,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,"ARTICLE","Hydrobiologia","1","147-155","cited By 17","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976507856&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-016-2891-7&partnerID=40&md5=81b9e09bf27b669ccadcbc5ad0ab40cb","Department of Aquatic Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), Droevendaalsesteeg 10, Wageningen, 6708 PB, Netherlands","Aquatic;  Diet selection;  Lymnaea stagnalis;  Omnivore;  Temperature;  Trophic interaction","China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council, CSC funding_text 1={Acknowledgments We sincerely thank Antonella Petruzzella, Haikun Ma, Dennis Waasdorp, and Nico Helmsing for their assistance in performing the experiment, and Michiel Verhofstad and Bart Grutters for their experienced advice regarding all culturing and feeding processes.

However, few studies have compared the performance of invasive predators and native prey, despite the fact that non-native predators are well known to disrupt native communities. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis' suggests that predators are less tolerant of increasing environmental stress than their prey, whereas the tolerant invaders hypothesis' suggests that invaders are more tolerant than native species due to selection during the introduction process. It is therefore unclear how invasive predators will respond to increasing climate stressors. We coupled physiological measurements (thermal tolerance, thermal optima, salinity tolerance, predation rate) with environmental time-series data to assess the effects of warming and extreme low salinity events on non-native predators (gastropods) and native prey (oysters) from a coastal ecosystem. In general support of the trophic sensitivity hypothesis, we found that both non-native predators exhibited lower thermal optima relative to native prey, lower salinity tolerance and one predator was less tolerant of warming. However, because warming tolerance was extremely high (i.e. habitat temperature is 79-21 degrees C below thermal tolerance), near-term warming may first increase predator performance (consumption and growth rates), with negative effects on prey. Low salinity will likely produce heterogeneous effects on predator-prey interactions due to varying watershed sizes among estuaries that control the duration of low salinity events. The trophic sensitivity hypothesis may be a useful framework for understanding community responses to extreme climate change, which portends a decoupling of predator-prey interactions. However, we conclude that this hypothesis must be evaluated in environmental context and that coupling physiological metrics with insitu environmental data offers the best predictive power of near-term climate change impacts on invaded communities. Within our study system, warming is likely to intensify the impacts of both invasive predators, which may greatly reduce the abundance of the native oyster, a species of conservation and restoration focus.",NA,"10.1111/1365-2435.12759",NA,NA,"0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,"WOS:000395347300010",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,15,15,0,15,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"savedrecs_definitivo.txt",1,"selected","precisa ver melhor"

Because many of the underlying mechanisms of foraging are temperature dependent in ectotherms, the distribution of ectothermic foragers between food patches may similarly depend on temperature because the difference in fitness rewards between these patches may change with temperature. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of Common Gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) between food patches can be explained by an IFD, but that conformance to an IFD weakens as temperature departs from the optimal temperature because fitness rewards, interference competition and the number of individuals foraging are highest at the optimal temperature. First, we determined the optimal temperature for foraging. Second, we examined group foraging at three temperatures and three density treatments. Search time was optimized at 27 degrees C, handling time at 29 degrees C and digestion time at 32 degrees C. Gartersnakes did not match an IFD at any temperature, but their distribution did change with temperature: snakes at 20 degrees C and at 30 degrees C selected both food patches equally, while snakes at 25 degrees C selected the low food patch more at low density and the high food patch more at high density. Food consumption and competition increased with temperature, and handling time decreased with temperature. Temperature therefore had a strong impact on foraging, but did not affect the IFD.

Due to the effects of temperature on both the physiology and the behaviour of such ectotherms, understanding how global warming may influence their ecological impact is a research priority. These species were therefore exposed to three different food types to determine their detritivorous, herbivorous and carnivorous characters, and predation was measured characterizing the Holling’s functional response. The effect of increasing water temperatures (15, 20, 25°C) on both the food choice and predatory activities was investigated. Both species showed a significant preference for animal tissues at all temperatures. The total food intake increased with temperature for G. tigrinus but did not change for D. villosus, which may result from specific species differences in metabolic requirements. The consumption of live prey strongly increased with temperature. The main differences were an increased searching efficiency in G. tigrinus and a decreased handling time in D. villosus as temperature increased, which may result from differences in foraging strategies. These results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the predation pressure of both invasive gammarids on prey species. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",NA,"10.1007/s10750-015-2312-3",NA,NA,"0018-8158","1573-5117",NA,"WOS:000385154400004",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,9,9,0,8,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,"ARTICLE","Hydrobiologia","1","43-54","cited By 12","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931075457&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-015-2312-3&partnerID=40&md5=8facd83a6fa832cd269055c3dffdac5a","UMR CNRS 6553 Ecosystèmes, Biodiversité, Evolution, (ECOBIO), Université Rennes 1, 263 avenue du Général Leclerc, Rennes Cedex, 35042, France; UMR Institut d’Ecologie et des Sciences de l’Environnement de Paris, Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), 7 quai Saint Bernard, Paris Cedex 05, 75252, France","Amphipods;  Biological invasions;  Climate change;  Predatory impact;  Trophic ecology",NA,"Beale, E.M.L., Confidence regions in non-linear estimation (with discussion) (1960) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 22, pp. 41-88; Bellard, C., Thuiller, W., Leroy, B., Genovesi, P., Bakkenes, M., Courchamp, F., Will climate change promote future invasions?

Not only average daily temperature, but also diurnal temperature variations may affect prey consumption and life history traits of ectotherms. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations on body size, predation capacity and oviposition rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) when presented with eggs of their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). For both predators, mean daily temperature as well as temperature alternation had a substantial impact on the number of prey consumed. At lower average temperatures, more eggs were killed under an alternating temperature regime (20 °C/5 °C and 25 °C/10 °C) than at the corresponding mean constant temperatures (15 and 20 °C). At higher average temperatures (>25 °C), however, the opposite was observed with higher numbers of prey killed at constant temperatures than at alternating temperatures. At 25 °C, temperature variation had no effect on the predation capacity. A similar trend as for the predation rates was observed for the oviposition rates of the phytoseiids. Body size of N. californicus was affected both by average daily temperature and temperature variation, with smaller adult females emerging at alternating temperatures than at constant temperatures, whereas for P. persimilis, temperature variation had no impact on its body size. Our results demonstrate that temperature variations are likely to affect biological control of T. urticae by the studied phytoseiid predators. © 2015, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).",NA,"10.1007/s10526-015-9677-0",NA,NA,"1386-6141","1573-8248",NA,"WOS:000360999800002",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,6,6,0,6,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,"ARTICLE","BioControl","5","595-603","cited By 6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941415786&doi=10.1007%2fs10526-015-9677-0&partnerID=40&md5=ac49107ef2af3d72f49bee18d9b1a6e1","Laboratory of Agrozoology, Department of Crop Protection, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent, 9000, Belgium; PCS-Ornamental Plant Research, Schaessestraat 18, Destelbergen, 9070, Belgium; Entomology Department, Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Hanoi, Viet Nam","Biological control;  Diurnal temperature range;  Phytoseiidae;  Predation;  Temperature size rule;  Tetranychidae",NA,"Abad-Moyano, R., Pina, T., Ferragut, F., Urbaneja, A., Comparative life-history traits of three phytoseiid mites associated with Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) colonies in clementine orchards in eastern Spain: implications for biological control (2009) Exp Appl Acarol, 47, pp. 121-132; Angilletta, M.J., Steury, T.D., Sears, M.W., Temperature, growth rate, and body size in ectotherms: fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle (2004) Integr Comp Biol, 44, pp. 498-509; Atkinson, D., Temperature and organism size—a biological law for ectotherms?

Copper and temperature modulate predator-prey interactions in larval dragonflies and anurans",NA,NA,"ECOSPHERE",NA,"",NA,NA,"6","4","","56",NA,NA,"","","Amphibians are important indicators of environmental health, and their populations are in worldwide decline. The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 μg Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22°C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17°). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments. We suggest that increased concentrations of dissolved copper and elevated water temperatures are harmful to amphibian prey through maladaptive behavioral responses in the presence of predators. © 2015 Hayden et al.",NA,"10.1890/ES14-00461.1",NA,NA,"2150-8925","",NA,"WOS:000354777300011",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,20,22,0,21,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,NA,"ARTICLE","Ecosphere","4",NA,"cited By 21","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928794012&doi=10.1890%2fES14-00461.1&partnerID=40&md5=f2dc353a17b60a1a5bb92f44c48e1c6d","Department of Environmental Science, Alaska Pacific University, 4101 University Drive, Anchorage, AK  99508, United States; United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage Fisheries and Ecological Services Office, 605 West 4 Avenue, Room G-61, Anchorage, AK  99501, United States; Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA  95616, United States","Alaska;  Amphibian;  Copper;  Frog;  Lithobates sylvaticus;  Multiple stressor;  Predator;  Temperature;  Toxicity",NA,"ADEC [Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation], (2008) Alaska Water Quality Criteria Manual for Toxic and Other Deleterious Organic and Inorganic Substances.

These interactions can change with warming, depending on the foraging mode of the predator. Theory predicts that warming increases foraging velocity in ectotherms, but in a sit-and-wait predator that has zero velocity when foraging, the interaction strength should be temperature independent. Using the protist Urocentrum turbo and the sitand- wait copepod Orthocyclops modestus, we tested this prediction by measuring dynamic interaction strengths (effect of a predator on prey population growth rate) and by estimating the parameters of a functional response. Both of these metrics were consistent with the prediction that interaction strength is temperature independent in a sit-and-wait predator. Our results indicate that there may be considerable variability in how warming alters foraging interactions, and estimating the overall effects of climate change on food webs may require consideration of the distribution of foraging strategies and the potential asymmetries that arise with interactions that involve different strategies. © 2014 Novich et al.",NA,"10.1890/ES14-00216.1",NA,NA,"2150-8925","",NA,"WOS:000345097200015",NA,"","","","",NA,"",NA,NA,15,16,1,16,NA,NA,"J",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,NA,"ARTICLE","Ecosphere","10",NA,"cited By 18","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919785836&doi=10.1890%2fES14-00216.1&partnerID=40&md5=cc51c132fe23e814d57b6abd5f2ff3c0","School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE  68588, United States","Allometry;  Body size;  Climate change;  Interaction strength;  Orthocyclops modestus;  Predator prey interactions;  Urocentrum turbo",NA,"Alcaraz, M., Strickler, J.R., Locomotion in copepods: Pattern of movements and energetics of Cyclops (1988) Hydrobiologia, 167-168, pp. 409-414; Aljetlawi, A.A., Sparrevik, E., Leonardsson, K., Prey-predator size-dependent functional response: Derivation and rescaling to the real world (2004) Journal of Animal Ecology, 73, pp. 239-252; Bolker, B.M., (2011) Ecological Models and Data, , R.

While the detrimental effects of summer heat waves have been widely studied, little is known about the impacts of winter warming on marine species in temperate regions. Many species benefit from low winter temperature-induced reductions in metabolism, as these permit conservation of energy reserves that are needed to support reproduction in spring. Here, we used a unique outdoor mesocosm system to expose a coastal predator-prey system, the sea star Asterias and the blue mussel Mytilus, to different winter warming scenarios under near-natural conditions. We found that the body condition of mussels decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. Sea star growth also decreased with increasing temperature, which was a function of unaltered predation rates and decreased mussel body condition. Asterias relative digestive gland mass strongly declined over the studied temperature interval (ca twofold). This could have severe implications for reproductive capacity in the following spring, as digestive glands provide reserve compounds to maturing gonads. Thus, both predator and prey suffered from a mismatch of energy acquisition versus consumption in warmer winter scenarios, with pronounced consequences for food web energy transfer in future oceans. © 2020 The Author(s).",NA,"10.1098/rspb.2020.0970rspb20200970",NA,NA,"09628452",NA,32673558,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ARTICLE","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","1931",NA,"cited By 0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088156751&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2020.0970rspb20200970&partnerID=40&md5=dbd65ad83c58957f12708d0378cfc01e","Marine Ecology, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Hohenbergstrasse 2, Kiel, 24105, Germany; Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany","climate change;  coastal ecology;  trophic energy transfer",NA,"Pinsky, M.L., Worm, B., Fogarty, M.J., Sarmiento, J.L., Levin, S.A., Marine taxa track local climate velocities (2013) Science, 341, pp. 1239-1242; Poloczanska, E.S., Global imprint of climate change on marine life (2013) Nat.
