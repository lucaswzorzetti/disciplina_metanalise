BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				92	2			1011	1026		10.1111/brv.12266				MAY 2017	2017	Global warming has revitalized interest in the relationship between body size and temperature, proposed by Bergmann's rule 150 years ago, one of the oldest manifestations of a 'biogeography of traits'. We review biogeographic evidence, results from clonal cultures and recent micro-and mesocosm experiments with naturally mixed phytoplankton communities regarding the response of phytoplankton body size to temperature, either as a single factor or in combination with other factors such as grazing, nutrient limitation, and ocean acidification. Where possible, we also focus on the comparison between intraspecific size shifts and size shifts resulting from changes in species composition. Taken together, biogeographic evidence, community-level experiments and single-species experiments indicate that phytoplankton average cell sizes tend to become smaller in warmer waters, although temperature is not necessarily the proximate environmental factor driving size shifts. Indirect effects via nutrient supply and grazing are important and often dominate. In a substantial proportion of field studies, resource availability is seen as the only factor of relevance. Interspecific size effects are greater than intraspecific effects. Direct temperature effects tend to be exacerbated by indirect ones, if warming leads to intensified nutrient limitation or copepod grazing while ocean acidification tends to counteract the temperature effect on cell size in non-calcifying phytoplankton. We discuss the implications of the temperature-related size trends in a global-warming context, based on known functional traits associated with phytoplankton size. These are a higher affinity for nutrients of smaller cells, highest maximal growth rates of moderately small phytoplankton (ca. 102 mu m(3)), size-related sensitivities for different types of grazers, and impacts on sinking rates. For a phytoplankton community increasingly dominated by smaller algae we predict that: (i) a higher proportion of primary production will be respired within the microbial food web; (ii) a smaller share of primary production will be channeled to the classic phytoplankton-crustacean zooplankton-fish food chain, thus leading to decreased ecological efficiency from a fish-production point of view; (iii) a smaller share of primary production will be exported through sedimentation, thus leading to decreased efficiency of the biological carbon pump.									43	0	0	0	39	0	43			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000398567200021	27028628

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				102	5			759	770		10.1007/s10641-019-00869-4				MAY 2019	2019	In this study, the growth rate, gut fullness, diet composition and spatial distribution of brown trout was compared between artificial channels with and without fine wood (FW). Access to FW resulted in significantly lower brown trout growth rates over the study period from late summer to early winter as water temperatures declined from 17 degrees C to 1 degrees C. Access to FW resulted in minor differences in occurrence of the most common taxa found in brown trout diets, except for chironomid larvae which were found in c. 60% of the brown trout guts from control treatments but in only 30% of the guts from FW treatments in early winter. Diet consisted primarily of case-bearing and free-living Trichoptera larvae, Asellus, chironomid and Ephemeroptera larvae. Brown trout gut fullness was not significantly affected by access to FW bundles. Brown trout aggregated among FW but were more evenly distributed in channels lacking it. Our results suggest that juvenile brown trout use FW as a shelter at a wide range of water temperatures, and that this behaviour may result in reduced growth rates during their first fall and the onset of their first winter. We also show that prey availability and the composition of brown trout diet changes from late summer to early winter and that FW has a small but significant effect on brown trout diet composition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000468519700008

Larval rearing experiments to determine the effects of temperature and diet on the growth and survival of D.orbita larvae under laboratory conditions comprised five different unicellular algal diets of two brown algal species; Isochysis galbana and Chaetoceros muelleri, two green algae; Tetraselmis seucica and Nannochloropsis oculata, and a mixture of all four strains for larvae maintained at 16 and 22 degrees C. Absolute growth, specific growth rate (SGR) and survival were determined regularly. Larvae reared at 22 degrees C on a mixed diet, or brown algae, performed significantly better than those reared on green algal diets alone. Preliminary trials with settlement cues were undertaken on different aged larvae to determine when larvae become competent. An array of natural cues (carrion, Xenostrobus pulex, adult mucus and Ulvella lens), as well as concentrations of KCl was tested. KCl(concentration of 20mM) induced the greatest settlement, however, no larvae metamorphosed under the conditions provided. This study confirms long-lived planktotrophic larval development for Dicathais orbita with higher development rates at the higher water temperatures. Further studies will optimize culture conditions and cues for settlement and metamorphosis.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000353970800017

HYDROBIOLOGIA				648	1			73	81		10.1007/s10750-010-0147-5				JUL 2010	2010	Plankton in mountain lakes are confronted with generally higher levels of incident ultraviolet radiation (UVR), lower temperatures, and shorter growing seasons than their lower elevation counterparts. The direct inhibitory effects of high UVR and low temperatures on montane phytoplankton are widely recognized. Yet little is known about the indirect effects of these two abiotic factors on phytoplankton, and more specifically whether they alter zooplankton grazing rates which may in turn influence phytoplankton. Here, we report the results of field microcosm experiments that examine the impact of temperature and UVR on phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing rates (by adult female calanoid copepods). We also examine consequent changes in the absolute and relative abundance of the four dominant phytoplankton species present in the source lake (Asterionella formosa, Dinobryon sp., Discostella stelligera, and Fragilaria crotonensis). All four species exhibited higher growth rates at higher temperatures and three of the four species (all except Dinobryon) exhibited lower growth rates in the presence of UVR versus when shielded from UVR. The in situ grazing rates of zooplankton had significant effects on all species except Asterionella. Lower temperatures significantly reduced grazing rates on Fragilaria and Discostella, but not Dinobryon. While UVR had no effect on zooplankton grazing on any of the four species, there was a significant interaction effect of temperature and UVR on zooplankton grazing on Dinobryon. Discostella and Dinobryon increased in abundance relative to the other species in the presence of UVR. Colder temperatures, the presence of zooplankton, and UVR all had consistently negative effects on rates of increase in overall phytoplankton biomass. These results demonstrate the importance of indirect as well as direct effects of climate forcing by UVR and temperature on phytoplankton community composition in mountain lakes, and suggest that warmer climates and higher UVR levels may favor certain species over others.									35	1	0	0	35	1	39			0018-8158			WOS:000277284000006

We investigated in laboratory microcosms, the effects of elevated temperatures and reduced leaf litter quality on the life-history traits of a saprophagous macroarthropod (development time, growth, survival and reproduction). Millipedes (Polydesmus angustus) from an Atlantic temperate forest were reared throughout their life cycle (>= 16 months) under two temperature regimes differing on average by 3.3 degrees C; in a factorial design, they were fed either on Atlantic leaf litter or on Mediterranean leaf litter with a higher C : N ratio; humidity was consistently high. The components of the population growth rate (r) were affected positively by the temperature rise and negatively by the switch from Atlantic to Mediterranean leaf litter. When both treatments were combined, litter effects offset temperature effects. These results show that the short-term response of saprophagous macroarthropods to warming is positive but depends on the availability of high-quality litter, which is difficult to predict in the global change context. In a parallel experiment, conspecific millipedes from a Mediterranean population, which have evolved for a long time in a warmer climate and on poor-quality litter, were reared at elevated temperatures on Mediterranean leaf litter. All components of r were higher than in the Atlantic population under the same conditions. This suggests that in the longer term, macroarthropods can overcome detrimental trophic interactions. Based on our study and the literature, we conclude that for decades the positive effects of warming on saprophagous macrofauna should exceed the negative effects of changes in litter quality. The abundance of those organisms in temperate forests could increase, which is confirmed by latitudinal patterns in Europe. Studies aimed at predicting the impacts of global change on decomposition will need to consider interactions with soil macroinvertebrates.									27	3	0	0	28	0	30			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000262347600012		
J	Matheson, Kyle; Gagnon, Patrick				Gagnon, Patrick/B-4327-2012				Temperature mediates non-competitive foraging in indigenous rock (Cancer irroratus Say) and recently introduced green (Carcinus maenas L.) crabs from Newfoundland and Labrador								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				414				6	18		10.1016/j.jembe.2012.01.006				MAR 15 2012	2012	The green crab, Carcinus maenas, was recently (2007) introduced to predominantly cold water ecosystems of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). The known broad diet of the green crab in warmer ecosystems of the northwest Atlantic raised concerns about its ability to interfere with species indigenous to NL, especially the rock crab, Cancer irroratus, which exhibits common preference with the green crab for the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. We used two experiments to determine the effects of low water temperature representative of southern NL (4 degrees C and 12 degrees C), body size (small, medium, and large), chela loss, and chemical cues from live and dead conspecifics and heterospecifics on capture and selection of blue mussels in six size classes (10 to 40 mm in shell length) and five associated behaviors (handling, feeding, sitting, moving, and burying in sediments or using an artificial cavity) in rock and green crabs from NL held individually in microcosm tanks. Experiment 1, which addressed the effects of changes in water temperature, body size, and chela loss on foraging in both rock and green crabs, indicated that mussel capture was nearly three times higher in large than small individuals in both species. Large rock and green crabs captured between 43 and 46% of the largest (>30 mm) mussels, while small rock and green crabs captured 25 and 76% of the smallest (<20 mm) mussels, respectively. Chela loss caused a twofold decrease in mussel capture in rock crabs, though did not affect green crabs. Experiment 2, which addressed the effects of changes in water temperature and chemical cues on foraging in rock crabs, showed that cues from rock crabs (live and dead) and green crabs (live) had no effect on mussel capture, while causing only subtle changes in mussel size selection. However. small rock crabs buried in sediments or were located within the artificial cavity twice as often in the presence of cues from dead rock crabs than in the absence of cues. Overall, the crabs captured approximately three times more mussels at 12 degrees C than 4 degrees C regardless of crab species, crab size, chela loss, and the presence or absence of chemical cues, which therefore demonstrate the pervasive effect of low temperature on foraging in both rock and green crabs. We conclude that the recent introduction of the green crab to Newfoundland and Labrador may have a greater impact on foraging in small than large rock crabs and those missing one chela, while altering mussel populations through marked preference by small green crabs for small mussels.

One predicted effect is the potential shift in phytoplankton community structure towards increased cyanobacterial abundance. Given that cyanobacteria are known to be a nutritionally poor food source, we hypothesized that such a shift would reduce the efficiency of feeding and growth of northern zooplankton. To test this hypothesis, we first isolated a clone of Daphnia pulex from a permafrost thaw pond in subarctic Quebec, and confirmed that it was triploid but otherwise genetically similar to a diploid, reference clone of the same species isolated from a freshwater pond in southern Quebec. We used a controlled flow-through system to investigate the direct effect of temperature and indirect effect of subarctic picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus) on threshold food concentrations and growth rate of the high latitude clone. We also compared the direct effect of temperature on both Daphnia clones feeding on eukaryotic picoplankton (Nannochloropsis). The high latitude clone had a significantly lower food threshold for growth than the temperate clone at both 18 and 26 degrees C, implying adaptation to lower food availability even under warmer conditions. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were present in the picoeukaryote but not the cyanobacterium, confirming the large difference in food quality. The food threshold for growth of the high latitude Daphnia was 3.7 (18 degrees C) to 4.2 (26 degrees C) times higher when fed Synechococcus versus Nannochloropsis, and there was also a significant negative effect of increased temperature and cyanobacterial food on zooplankton fatty acid content and composition. The combined effect of temperature and food quality on the performance of the high latitude Daphnia was greater than their effects added separately, further indicating the potentially strong indirect effects of climate warming on aquatic food web processes.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			1932-6203			WOS:000354544200100	25970289	
J	OLESEN, NJ								CLEARANCE POTENTIAL OF JELLYFISH AURELIA-AURITA, AND PREDATION IMPACT ON ZOOPLANKTON IN A SHALLOW COVE								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				124	1-3			63	72		10.3354/meps124063				AUG 1995	1995	The potential predation impact of jellyfish Aurelia aurita on zooplankton in a shallow cove was investigated. Population clearance potential was calculated from laboratory clearance rates and from measurements of medusae size and abundance during 1991 and 1992 in the shallow cove Kertinge Nor, Denmark. Clearance by A. aurita as a function of medusae size and water temperature was measured in the laboratory using copepods (Acartia tonsa) and rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) as prey. Clearance rate increased (from 0.01 to 2.3 1 h(-1) ind(-1)) with increasing medusae diameter (from 4 to 44 mm) when rotifers were used as prey. For medusae > 5 mm, clearance on copepods and rotifers was similar. Water temperature had marked effect on clearance, which increased from 0.16 1 h(-1) ind-l at 5 degrees C to 0.58 1 h(-1) ind(-1) at 14 for a 20 mm medusa feeding on A. tonsa. Between 14 and 21 degrees C clearance was constant, and at 30 degrees C the medusae died. In spring, when medusa were small, the population in Kertinge Nor could potentially have cleared the volume of water in the cove less than 0.1 times each day. This value was 3.5 times each day in late summer when biomass was high. Blooms of rotifers were observed in Kertinge Nor, but only during periods of low population clearance potential of A. aurita, and the abundance of holozooplankton in general was extremely low in Kertinge Nor during 1991 and 1992. High predation pressure by medusae appears to control zooplankton in the shallow cove, at least during summer and early fall, and A. aurita may thus be considered as a keystone species in the control of the trophic structure in Kertinge Nor.									78	10	0	0	69	1	90			0171-8630			WOS:A1995RW86700006

Instances of type I, II, III, and IV functional responses are considered, the last of which incorporates prey interference with predation. It is shown that the model systems with the type I, II, and III functional responses exhibit qualitatively similar bifurcation and stability behavior over the interval of definition of the temperature parameter. Similar behavior is found in the system with the type IV functional response at low levels of prey interference. Higher levels of interference are destabilizing, as illustrated by the prevalence of bistability and by the presence of three attractors for some values of the model parameters. All four systems are capable of modeling population oscillations and outbreaks.									97	9	0	0	19	0	105			0303-6812			WOS:A1997YJ08500003		
J	Crozier, LG								Field transplants reveal summer constraints on a butterfly range expansion								OECOLOGIA				141	1			148	157		10.1007/s00442-004-1634-z				SEP 2004	2004	The geographic ranges of most species are expected to shift to higher elevations and latitudes in response to global warming. But species react to specific environmental changes in individualistic ways, and we are far from a detailed understanding of range-shifts. Summer temperature often limits the ranges of insects and plants, so many range-shifts are expected to track summer warming. I explore this potential range-limiting factor in a case study of a northwardly expanding American butterfly, Atalopedes campestris (Lepidoptera, Hesperiidae). This species has recently colonized the Pacific Northwest, USA, where the mean annual temperature has risen 0.8-1.8degreesC over the past 100 years. Using field transplant experiments across the current range edge, I measured development time, survivorship, fecundity and predation rates along a naturally occurring thermal gradient of 3degreesC. Development time was significantly slower outside the current range in eastern Washington (WA), as expected because of cooler temperatures there. Slower development would reduce the number of generations possible per year outside the current range, dramatically lowering the probability that a population could survive there. Differences in survivorship, fecundity and predation rate across the range edge were not significant. The interaction between summer and winter temperature appears to be crucial in defining the current range limit. The estimated difference in temperature required to affect the number of generations is greater than the extent of summer warming observed over the past century, however, and thus historically winter temperature alone probably limited the range in southeastern WA. Nonetheless, extraordinarily warm summers may have improved colonization success, increasing the probability of a range expansion. These results suggest that extreme climatic events may influence rates of response to long-term climate change. They also demonstrate that range-limiting factors can change over time, and that the asymmetry in seasonal warming trends will have biological consequences.									45	2	0	0	41	0	47			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000223560000017	15278427

Balancing decreased mortality risk when sheltering with increased feeding rate when exposed is believed to be a key determinant of diel patterns of sheltering in many animals.Despite lower foraging efficiency at night than during the day, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar parr are nocturnal during winter and at low summer temperatures. Nocturnal activity also occurs at warm water temperatures during summer, but little is known about the functional significance of this behaviour.This study aimed to determine: (1) the preferred activity and shelter pattern of Atlantic salmon parr during warm summer months, and (2) their response to variations in food availability when balancing growth rate (G) and mortality risk (M), as expressed through time out of shelter. We differentiated among four potential responses to reduced food availability: (1) no response; (2) G decreases but M remains constant; (3) G remains constant but M increases; and (4) G decreases and M increases.Time exposed from shelter was inversely related to food availability. Fish subject to high food availability were significantly less active during the day than those with restricted rations. However, food availability had no significant effect on the extent to which fish were active at night. There was no evidence of variation in growth rate with food availability.Salmon were predominantly nocturnal at high ration levels, consistent with their previously reported behaviour during winter. Rather than switching to diurnal behaviour at high temperatures per se, as previously was supposed, it appears that the fish are diurnal only to the extent needed to sustain a growth rate, and this extent depends on food availability.Atlantic salmon parr modulate the amount of time they are active rather than growth when responding to variations in food availability over an order of magnitude.									47	0	0	0	46	0	47			0021-8790			WOS:000237517000006	16689950

Selective agents, such as introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits, suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection. These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to selection by temperature.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000466555000008

We focused on the impact of changing temperature because of its well-established effects on protozoan rates and its ecological relevance, from daily fluctuations to climate change. We showed, first, that there was considerable inter-strain variability in thermal sensitivity of maximum growth rate, revealing distinct differences among multiple strains of our model species Oxyrrhis marina. We then intensively examined two representative strains that exhibited distinctly different thermal responses and parameterised the influence of temperature on their functional and numerical responses. Finally, we assessed how these responses alter predator-prey population dynamics. We did this first considering a standard approach, which assumes that functional and numerical responses are directly coupled, and then compared these results with a novel framework that incorporates both functional and numerical responses in a fully parameterised model. We conclude that:(i) including functional diversity of protozoa at the sub-species level alters model predictions and (ii) including directly measured, independent functional and numerical responses in a model provides a more realistic account of predator-prey dynamics.

Environmental change can, therefore, mediate the strength of consumption relative to production such that the abundance of primary producers is altered, potentially driving phase-shifts from one habitat type to another (e.g. the displacement kelp forests by mats of turfs along temperate coasts). Here, we assessed the extent to which herbivores may counter the increased cover of kelp-competitors (i.e. turfs) anticipated to be caused by enriched nutrients and CO2. Specifically, we experimentally enriched nutrients and CO2 and quantified the change in cover of algal turfs in the presence and absence of gastropod grazers. In the absence of grazers, turf algae responded positively to the combination of enriched nutrients and CO2 such that they occupied >95% of available space. In contrast, where grazers were present, sparse covers of algal turfs were maintained even under CO2 and nutrient enrichment (i.e. turfs occupied <5% of available space). This result indicates that consumption by grazers increased where enrichment of nutrients and CO2 facilitated greater algal cover such that cover continued to be largely restricted. By recognising the environmental conditions which will maintain or disrupt the balance between the processes of production and consumption, we may improve forecasts regarding the probability of habitat stasis or shifts.									25	0	0	0	23	0	25			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000330723600007		
J	Sanford, E; Menge, BA				Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012				Spatial and temporal variation in barnacle growth in a coastal upwelling system								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				209				143	157		10.3354/meps209143				2001	2001	Recent studies suggest that large-scale Variation in nearshore primary productivity may strongly influence the dynamics of rocky intertidal communities. Among the hypothesized effects is a Link between phytoplankton abundance and the growth of barnacles and other suspension feeders. We tested the strength of this association on the central coast of Oregon, USA, by quantifying water-column chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and the growth of 2 intertidal barnacles (Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli). Barnacles were photographed at 13 d intervals on mid-intertidal growth plates attached in wave-exposed and wave-protected habitats at 2 sites differing in nearshore productivity: Strawberry Hill (SH) and Boiler Bay (BB), Oregon. B, glandula grew more rapidly in wave-exposed areas than wave-protected habitats, presumably because higher flows delivered more food to passively feeding barnacles. After several months, individuals of both species attained a larger size at SH, the site with consistently higher chi a concentrations. Surprisingly, short-term growth rates only partially matched spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton. Growth rates were low during a persistent upwelling event, and increased 2- to 3-fold during the subsequent upwelling relaxation. At SH, this increase coincided with a major phytoplankton bloom, but growth rates remained high well after chi a concentrations decreased. Moreover, parallel increases in growth were observed at BE, despite the fact that no bloom was recorded at this site. These results imply that factors other than phytoplankton contributed to Variation in barnacle growth. Records of barnacle settlement suggest that water-column concentrations of larvae increased dramatically at both sites during the period of high barnacle growth. Published analyses of stomach contents indicate that zooplankton may be an important food source in other barnacle species. Yet another factor, water temperature, was also elevated during the period of sustained barnacle growth. Increased barnacle growth during the upwelling relaxation may thus have arisen from the combined benefits of more phytoplankton, more zooplankton, and warmer water temperatures. Incorporating the influence of zooplankton and water temperature into studies of bottom-up influences may improve our ability to explain variation among intertidal communities.									79	1	0	0	73	1	80			0171-8630			WOS:000166834500012

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE ICHTHYOLOGIE				16	6			262	265		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00251.x				DEC 2000	2000	The oxygen consumption of adult burbot, Lota lota CL.), was examined to determine the effects of fasting and meal ration on oxygen consumption rates. The temperature (2.1 degreesC) was selected to represent ambient conditions for burbot in winter. The average pre-feeding oxygen consumption rate was 29.5 mg kg(-1) h(-1). Feeding affected the oxygen consumption rates since the apparent heat increment correlated significantly with the meal ration. However, the meal ration (i.e. vendace, Coregonus albula L.) did not affect the proportion of the ingested meal energy used in the apparent heat increment. When the meal ration was increased, peak oxygen consumption ranged from 1.2 to 2.2 times higher than the fasting level. Observed low oxygen consumption values suggest that the metabolic processes of burbot are strongly reduced in low temperatures.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0175-8659			WOS:000166256800005		
J	Tolonen, A								Application of a bioenergetics model for analysis of growth and food consumption of subarctic whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) in Lake Kilpisjarvi, Finnish Lapland								HYDROBIOLOGIA				390	1-3			153	169		10.1023/A:1003525008870				1998	1998	A bioenergetics model was used to estimate daily food consumption and growth of benthic whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) of age groups 1+ to 10+, in oligotrophic Lake Kilpisjarvi, northern Finnish Lapland. Fish and zooplankton samples and water temperature data were collected twice per month from February to December 1993. Simulation results indicated wide seasonal variations in consumption and growth rates. Growth was in general slow; especially in age-group 6 the net increase in weight was slight. The fit of the model to the weight data was good, and the model was able to follow even rapid seasonal variations in the weight. There were clear changes in the diet during the year. In March, when the food intake was reduced, copepods, mainly adult calanoids, formed the bulk of the food consumed. The most intensive consumption period lasted from June to late September. Chironomid pupae and planktonic cladocerans were the major summer food items. The largest individuals fed mainly on molluscs during summer. Zooplankton survey and consumption estimates did not show directly that the population density of copepodids and adults of Eudiaptomus graciloides were affected by whitefish predation although their population density decreased in spring. Nauplii, showing the maximum population density in April, were not consumed. The role of copepod consumption in the timing of Diphyllobothrium ditremum plerocercoid transmission to whitefish was also discussed. The increased copepod consumption rate during winter results in high energy intake but also an increased risk of food transmitted parasite infection.									18	0	1	0	17	0	20			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000080235900015

I observed the onset, duration, and cessation of quiescence from November 2013 to May 2014 and noted when coral tentacles no longer exhibited tactile responses, which I used as a proxy for quiescence. Results demonstrated that intertidal corals entered quiescence in December 2013, when air/water temperatures ranged from 0.71 degrees C to 5.7 degrees C, whereas subtidal populations entered quiescence in January when water temperatures ranged from 3.4 degrees C to 4.3 degrees C. Corals exited quiescence at similar temperatures (6.0-8.5 degrees C), again doing so earlier in the intertidal than subtidal populations (April and May 2014, respectively). Corals at both sites grew (added polyps) over the course of the study, but during quiescence, growth ceased in subtidal corals, and intertidal corals lost peripheral polyps. Competitive interactions between Northern Star-coral and the tunicate Didemnum vexillum (Carpet Tunicate) decreased during quiescence with a corresponding increase in "halo" width around each coral. I observed no change in halo-width between coral and the sponge Cliona celata (Red Boring Sponge). All corals examined exhibited winter quiescence, grew during the course of the study, and were released from competition with Carpet Sea-squirt Tunicate; no change in competition with Red Boring Sponge was observed.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1092-6194	1938-5307		WOS:000417261200010

Galaxias occidentalis and Galaxias truttaceus, consumed more mosquito larvae at 15 and 20A degrees C and were equally effective consumers of mosquito larvae as G. holbrooki at 25A degrees C. Nannoperca vittata and Bostokia porosa were equally as effective at consuming mosquito larvae as G. holbrooki at 15, 20 and 25A degrees C. G. occidentalis in particular warrant further investigation as a mosquito control agent, not only due to their high consumption of mosquito larvae, but also due to their propensity to kill, but not consume more mosquito larvae than the other four fish species at both 15 and 20A degrees C. For this species, stomach size and digestion rate do not appear to limit the number of mosquito larvae killed. These results indicate that endemic fish species may be more successful than the introduced G. holbrooki at mosquito control.									5	0	0	0	5	1	5			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000367196900027		
J	Rose, Kenneth A.; Kimmerer, Wim J.; Edwards, Karen P.; Bennett, William A.								Individual-Based Modeling of Delta Smelt Population Dynamics in the Upper San Francisco Estuary: I. Model Description and Baseline Results								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				142	5			1238	1259		10.1080/00028487.2013.799518				SEP 1 2013	2013	Many factors have been implicated in the decline of Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus in the upper San Francisco Estuary, and the importance of each factor is difficult to determine using field data alone. We describe a spatially explicit, individual-based population model of Delta Smelt configured for the upper estuary. The model followed the reproduction, growth, mortality, and movement of individuals over their entire life cycle on the same spatial grid of cells as the Delta Simulation Model (DSM2) hydrodynamics model. Daily values of water temperature, salinity, and densities of six zooplankton prey types were represented on the spatial grid. Reproduction was evaluated daily, and new individuals were introduced into the model as yolk sac larvae. Growth of feeding individuals was based on bioenergetics and zooplankton densities. Mortality sources included natural mortality, starvation, and entrainment in water diversion facilities. Movement of larvae was determined using a particle tracking model, while movement of juveniles and adults was based on salinity. Simulations were performed for 1995-2005. The baseline simulation was generally consistent with the available data. Predicted daily fractions of larvae entrained and annual fractions of adults entrained were similar in magnitude to data-based estimates but showed less interannual variation. Interannual differences in mean length at age 1 had large effects on maturity and subsequent egg production. Predicted and observed spatial distributions in the fall showed moderately good agreement for extremely low- and high-outflow years. As indicated by the population growth rate, 1998 was the best year and 2001 was the worst year. Water year 1998 (i.e., October 1997-September 1998) was characterized by fast growth in fall 1997, low entrainment, and high stage-specific survival rates, whereas water year 2001 had opposite conditions. Our analysis further shows how multiple factors can operate simultaneously to result in the decline in abundance of Delta Smelt.

We know little about their cumulative effects on ecosystems; however, even though this knowledge is fundamental to predicting and managing their consequences in a changing world. Here, we show that shifts in predator species composition can moderate both the individual and combined effects of warming and nutrient enrichment in marine systems. However, all three aspects of global change also acted independently to alter different functional groups in our flow-through marine rock-pool mesocosms. Specifically, warming reduced macroalgal biomass and assemblage productivity, whereas enrichment led to increased abundance of meso-invertebrate consumers, and loss of predator species led to increased gastropod grazer biomass. This disparity in responses, both across trophic levels (macroalgae and intermediate consumers), and between detecting additive effects on aggregate measures of ecosystem functioning, yet interactive effects on community composition, illustrates that our forecasting ability depends strongly on the level of ecological complexity incorporated within global change experiments. We conclude that biodiversity change-and loss of predator species in particular-plays a critical and overarching role in determining how ecological communities respond to stressors.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000449650600021	30246490

The model spatially covers three different oceanographic spatial domains corresponding to the Kuroshio, Oyashio, and interfrontal (mixed water) regions. In this coupled model, three (small, large, and predatory) zooplankton densities which were derived from the lower trophic level ecosystem model were input to the bioenergetics model of saury as the prey densities. Although certain model parameters were imposed from other species' bioenergetics, several model parameters were estimated from observational data specific to Pacific saury. The integrated model results reproduced appropriate growth rates of Pacific saury. Model sensitivities to water temperature and prey density are examined and observational methods to evaluate the model parameters are discussed.									51	0	0	0	43	0	59			1054-6006			WOS:000226723100011

This article reviews how and why Vertebrates are affected by the various components of global change. The effect of direct exploitation, while strong, is currently superseded by changes in use of all sorts, while climate change has started having significant effects on some Vertebrate populations. The low maximum growth rate of Vertebrate populations makes them particularly sensitive to global change, while they contribute relatively modestly to major ecosystem services. One may conclude that unless they are considered as sentinels of the biological consequences of global changes, their situation will go on strongly deteriorating, in particular under the influence of interactions of different components of global change such as changes in use and climate change.

J	MCMILLAN, RO; ARMSTRONG, DA; DINNEL, PA								COMPARISON OF INTERTIDAL HABITAT USE AND GROWTH-RATES OF 2 NORTHERN PUGET-SOUND COHORTS OF 0+ AGE DUNGENESS CRAB, CANCER-MAGISTER								ESTUARIES				18	2			390	398		10.2307/1352321				JUN 1995	1995	Density, habitat use, and growth of intertidal 0+ age Dungeness crabs, Cancer magister, were examined at five northern Puget Sound (Washington, USA) sites between June 1984 and September 1987. Sampling was conducted biweekly during settlement, from June to September, and approximately monthly or bimonthly thereafter. Northern Puget Sound Dungeness crab populations appear to be largely supported by recruitment from inland parental stocks, but a smaller proportion of recruits originate from coastal or oceanic stocks, as evidenced by earlier settlement and larger size of the first instar. Settlement of Dungeness crabs in inland waters typically peaked in August, and interannual variation in year-class strength at settlement (measured as intertidal density) was low relative to that reported for coastal crab populations. Spatial and interannual differences in settlement densities were mediated by high postsettlement mortality, which varied inversely with habitat complexity. Seasonal densities were highest in mixed sand and gravel with an overstory of attached or drift macroalgae, intermediate in eelgrass (Zostera marina), and lowest on open sand. Postsettlement growth rates corresponded to seasonal water temperatures and were greatest for the coastal cohort that settled in May and June. This cohort was larger as first juvenile instars (7.2 mm carapace width, CW) and grew rapidly at summer temperatures in excess of 15 degrees C to a size (>30 mm CW) that allowed emigration from intertidal to subtidal areas by September. The late summer cohort settled in August at 5.3 mm CW and soon after was subjected to decreasing autumn water temperatures. These crabs experienced little growth while overwintering in the intertidal, but growth rates increased in March, and the crabs emigrated in April and May, approximately 10 mo after settlement.									21	0	0	0	21	1	21			0160-8347			WOS:A1995RF76200009

Bythotrephes is thought to occur where a deep water daytime refuge from fish predation is available. Information from shallow, nearshore environments is relatively sparse, yet risk of secondary dispersal from these areas to inland waters is high. The production of desiccation-tolerant resting eggs, coupled with recreational boating activities, can facilitate spread inland. We determined Bythotrephes population demographics and dynamics at two sites in southern Green Bay during 2015 and 2016 to examine interactions with zooplankton and timing of resting egg production. Estimates of prey consumption rates by Bythotrephes were compared to those for a native predatory zooplankter, Leptodora kindtii, and against productivity estimates for potential crustacean prey. Bythotrephes population dynamics were similar at both sites in each year, with biomass peaks in September 2015 and July 2016. Earliest resting egg production occurred by 8 July 2015 and 17 June 2016; resting eggs occurred until at least October each year, when sampling ceased. Consumption by Bythotrephes generally exceeded that by Leptodora. Zooplankton productivity rates were lower than consumption rates on all dates in 2015 but approximated or exceeded consumption rates in 2016. Bythotrephes has become a major predator in the Green Bay lower food web, changing energy transfer through this major Great Lakes ecosystem. Its success has increased potential dispersal to inland lakes, especially from shallow, nearshore habitats such as occur in southern Green Bay.

Early life history of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus in southwestern Lake Michigan								JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH				41	2			436	447		10.1016/j.jglr.2015.03.009				JUN 2015	2015	Recruitment of fishes is difficult to predict due to inter-annual and system variation. For example, the early life history of fishes inhabiting expansive freshwater systems such as the Great Lakes differs from other freshwater environments but has received less attention. Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, an anadromous species adapted to living exclusively in freshwater, provides an opportunity to evaluate processes regulating growth and survival of a fish with marine origins inhabiting a large freshwater system. We collected age-0 alewives at three distinct locations (nearshore Chicago, nearshore Waukegan, offshore) in southwestern Lake Michigan during 2005 and 2006 to estimate density, growth, and survival. Larval alewife densities were up to three times greater and hatching peaks occurred earlier in 2005 compared to 2006. Back-calculated alewife hatch dates indicated that peak hatch occurred two weeks prior to peak catch rates, with similar hatching distributions of larvae collected between nearshore and offshore environments. Alewives up to approximately 16 d of age were collected in both nearshore locations before appearing in the offshore environment. Alewife growth rates were influenced by zooplankton density, water temperature, and hatching date whereas survival from the nearshore to offshore environment was influenced by wind events and hatching date. Prey availability and passive larval transport driven by offshore wind events are more commonly identified as factors influencing marine rather than freshwater larvae. Thus, factors affecting recruitment dynamics of fishes in large complex inland systems may be more similar to marine than freshwater systems.

Nontrophic (e.g. predator interference) and trophic components together determine species interaction strengths, but the effects of environmental factors on these two components remain largely unknown. This impedes our ability to fully understand the links between environmental drivers and species interactions. Here, we used a dynamical modelling framework based on measured predator functional responses to investigate the effects of predator diversity, prey density, and temperature on trophic and nontrophic interaction strengths within a freshwater food web. We found that (i) species interaction strengths cannot be predicted from trophic interactions alone, (ii) nontrophic interaction strengths vary strongly among predator assemblages, (iii) temperature has opposite effects on trophic and nontrophic interaction strengths, and (iv) trophic interaction strengths decrease with prey density, whereas the dependence of nontrophic interaction strengths on prey density is concave up. Interestingly, the qualitative impacts of temperature and prey density on the strengths of trophic and nontrophic interactions were independent of predator identity, suggesting a general pattern. Our results indicate that taking multiple environmental factors and the nonlinearity of density-dependent species interactions into account is an important step towards a better understanding of the effects of environmental variations on complex ecological communities. The functional response approach used in this study opens new avenues for (i) the quantification of the relative importance of the trophic and nontrophic components in species interactions and (ii) a better understanding how environmental factors affect these interactions and the dynamics of ecological communities.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000402514900010	27862723

One common method for quantifying feeding rates in fishes combines mass-based diet data with gastric evacuation times to estimate prey mass consumed per predator. An alternative approach is to estimate the rates of prey individuals consumed using prey identification time-the time period over which prey remain identifiable in a predator's stomach. One challenge with the analysis of prey identification times, however, is that the response variable is likely to be censored because the "true" prey identification time cannot be observed directly. Here, we applied survival analysis that can incorporate censored data to estimate the effects of predator body size, water temperature, and prey characteristics (type, count, and body size) on identification times in Reticulate Sculpin Cottus perplexus. We focused on seven types of prey that are common in this generalist predator's diet: mayflies (Ephemeroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), true flies (Diptera), beetles (Coleoptera), worms (Annelida), and sculpin eggs. An information-theoretic model comparison approach indicated that an accelerated failure time Weibull model with all five covariates provided the best relative fit to the full data set. Prey type had a strong effect on prey identification time, with annelid worms having the shortest times (<1 h) and caddisflies having the longest times (>15 h). Water temperature decreased prey identification time (7.5% per 1 degrees C increase), whereas prey count (i.e., meal size) increased prey identification time (15.5% per additional prey item). Predator body size had a weak negative effect on prey identification time (0.04% per 1-mm increase). Body sizes of some prey taxa, including mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies, increased prey identification times, leading to an interaction between prey type and prey size. Our study highlights the utility of survival analysis for quantifying variation in prey identification times in the diets of generalist predators.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000417033600004

Marine animals may make physiological and behavioral adaptations to cope with OA. Elevated pCO(2) may affect metabolism, feeding, and energy partition of marine crabs, and thereby affect their predator-prey dynamics with mussels. Therefore, we examined the effects of simulated future elevated pCO(2) on feeding behavior and energy metabolism of the brown crab Cancer pagurus. Following 54 days of pre-acclimation to control CO2 levels (360 m atm) at 11 degrees C, crabs were exposed to consecutively increased oceanic CO2 levels (2 weeks for 1200 and 2300 m atm, respectively) and subsequently returned to control CO2 level (390 m atm) for 2 weeks in order to study their potential to acclimate elevated pCO(2) and recovery performance. Standard metabolic rate (SMR), specific dynamic action (SDA) and feeding behavior of the crabs were investigated during each experimental period. Compared to the initial control CO2 conditions, the SMRs of CO2 exposed crabs were not significantly increased, but increased significantly when the crabs were returned to normal CO2 levels. Conversely, SDA was significantly reduced under high CO2 and did not return to control levels during recovery. Under high CO2, crabs fed on smaller sized mussels than under control CO2; food consumption rates were reduced; foraging parameters such as searching time, time to break the prey, eating time, and handling time were all significantly longer than under control CO2, and prey profitability was significantly lower than that under control conditions. Again, a two-week recovery period was not sufficient for feeding behavior to return to control values. PCA results revealed a positive relationship between feeding/SDA and pH, but negative relationships between the length of foraging periods and pH. In conclusion, elevated pCO(2) caused crab metabolic rate to increase at the expense of SDA. Elevated pCO(2) affected feeding performance negatively and prolonged foraging periods. These results are discussed in the context of how elevated pCO(2) may impair the competitiveness of brown crabs in benthic communities.									8	2	0	0	8	0	9			1664-042X			WOS:000442245100001	30246790

Prey abundance and composition and juvenile diet varied largely among sites. However, polychaete palps (mostly Pseudopolydora kempi) and bivalve siphons (mostly Nuttallia olivacea) were positively selected and frequently consumed by juveniles, indicating the generality of sublethal feeding of juvenile stone flounder in estuarine nurseries. Recent growth rates determined by otolith microstructure analyses were dependent on juvenile body size and water temperature, but independent of juvenile density and food abundance. Growth rates were nearly maximal from March to May, suggesting that food conditions are nearly optimal in these estuarine nurseries. Sublethal tissue cropping of benthic invertebrates is thought to contribute largely to these high growth rates.									24	1	0	0	25	2	26			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000244485800032		
J	Lefebure, R.; Larsson, S.; Bystrom, P.								Temperature and size-dependent attack rates of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus); are sticklebacks in the Baltic Sea resource-limited?								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				451				82	90		10.1016/j.jembe.2013.11.008				FEB 2014	2014	The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus is a small omnivorous fish, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. In the Baltic Sea, recently observed increases in their population densities have been attributed to declines of piscivorous predators. Concurrent with this predator release, an alternative hypothesis is that past and present consumption rates and resource limitation thresholds may have contributed to the recent increases in stickleback abundance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we estimated the size- and temperature-dependent attack rate and the critical resource density (CRD) of three-spined sticklebacks. We incorporated laboratory results with time series of zooplankton abundance to estimate historical trends in degrees of resource limitation in sticklebacks and evaluate if increases in individual consumption rates could be a plausible mechanism facilitating the suggested population increase. Attack rates increased with body size and temperature in laboratory experiments. Estimated CRD increased with size but decreased with temperature, suggesting that stickleback scope for individual and population growth might increase at temperatures above 15 degrees C. Our results further suggest that sticklebacks have been living closer to maximum consumption capacity in the coastal areas of the Bothnian Sea (BS) and Bothnian Bay (BB). Moreover, decreasing levels of resource limitation in the corresponding off-shore zones may have facilitated increases in stickleback densities for these areas. However, in the coastal zones of the Baltic proper (BP), resource levels have declined and are approaching the CRD, suggesting that stickleback populations in BP may not increase further. The decrease in CRD with temperature implies that increasing summer temperatures will increase the scope of individual and population growth in the three-spined stickleback and may favor the three-spined stickleback's competitive ability over other species under a warmer climate.

Its abundance is influenced by environmental factors like food quantity and quality, predation, diseases, temperature and washout by discharge. In ultra-oligotrophic Lake Brienz (Switzerland), which is turbid from suspended glacial material, Daphnia density has continuously decreased since the 1990 s. In spring and summer 1999, during and after a severe flood, Daphnia density was below detection level, but the population recovered the following year. Simultaneously, a drastic two-year decline occurred in the yield of whitefish (Coregonus sp.), which mainly feed on Daphnia. Several hypotheses were tested to explain the collapse of the Daphnia population: a negative effect of the suspended particles, a covering of the diapausing eggs by sediment, and a combined washout/temperature effect. A direct negative effect of the particles and covering of diapausing eggs could be excluded. According to model calculations, the spring growth of the Daphnia population could not compensate the washout losses, as it was limited by poor food conditions due to re-oligotrophication and reduced by extraordinarily low water temperatures. Moreover, ephippia abundance analysed from sediment cores was consistent with the process of eutrophication and re-oligotrophication and indicated that daphnids did not persist in the lake in the period before eutrophication (until 1955). Like most peri-alpine lakes in Europe, Lake Brienz has returned to its natural ultra-oligotrophic state and is now unable to support a large Daphnia population and fishing yield.									24	1	0	0	23	0	26			1015-1621	1420-9055		WOS:000247973100007

The inevitable increase in body size during ontogeny is associated with changes in both resource use and predation risk, which results in the ontogenetic shift in habitat preferences. In this study, we examined whether the shift in preferred body temperatures (T(p)s) of newt larvae Triturus alpestris increases the T(p)s deviation of the most vulnerable stages (after hatching and during metamorphosis) from the T(p)s range of their main predator, dragonfly larvae Aeshna cyanea - the 'predator-free temperatures' hypothesis. Analyses of thermoregulatory behaviour in the laboratory thermal gradient showed that freshly hatched newt larvae maintained lower water temperatures than larvae in later stages, whose T(p)s largely fell into the T(p)s range of dragonfly larvae. With respect to the thermal quality of natural habitat, the anti-predator effectiveness of the T(p)s shift decreased during development. Water temperatures in natural habitats were located largely below the preferred body temperature range of both newt and dragonfly larvae, which limits their potential thermal niche partitioning. We conclude that factors other than predator avoidance drive the ontogenetic T(p)s shift in our model system.									14	2	0	0	14	0	15			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000269743600009

Our results show that the SoG provides suitable food resources for sub-adult and adult ABFT. The SCA did not show inter-annual differences, and indicated that crustaceans were the most important prey group (alimentary index, AI = 37.47 and AI = 47.22 for 2012 and 2013, respectively), followed by fishes (AI = 28.71 and AI = 25.62, respectively) and cephalopods (AI = 1.55 and AI = 3.03). Diet compositions inferred from mixing models based on muscle and liver isotopic data showed that squid are an important food resource for the ABFT living in the SoG. Feeding patterns were analysed by the graphical method of Amundsen, which suggested that the ABFT exhibits a varying degree of specialisation on different prey. Thus, while most prey species were unimportant and rare, Sergia robusta can be considered as the dominant prey. The trophic niche width, estimated from SCA as the antilogarithm of Shannon's entropy, as well as from stable isotope Bayesian ellipses, indicated that the ABFT sampled in 2012 consumed a more diverse diet than those sampled in 2013. Inter-annual differences in daily meal and daily ration were apparent; whereas the estimated daily food intake was 918.91 g day(-1) in 2012 and 1924.95 g day(-1) in 2013, the daily ration showed values of 2.52 +/- 1.24% body mass (BM) day(-1) and 5.84 +/- 1.06% BM day(-1). Such substantial differences are probably due to differences in water temperatures between the sampling dates of the two years. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations.2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature.3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities.4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration.									53	0	0	0	49	0	53			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000274321200006	20002859	
J	Drinkwater, KF								The response of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to future climate change								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				62	7			1327	1337		10.1016/j.icesjms.2005.05.015				OCT 2005	2005	Future CO2-induced climate change scenarios from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) indicate increasing air temperatures, with the greatest warming in the Arctic and Subarctic, Changes to the wind fields and precipitation patterns are also suggested. These will lead to changes in the hydrographic properties of the ocean, as well as the vertical stratification and circulation patterns. Of particular note is the expected increase in ocean temperature. Based upon the observed responses of cod to temperature variability, the expected responses of cod stocks throughout the North Atlantic to the future temperature scenarios are reviewed and discussed here. Stocks in the Celtic and Irish Seas are expected to disappear under predicted temperature changes by the year 2100, while those in the southern North Sea and Georges Bank will decline. Cod will likely spread northwards along the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, occupy larger areas of the Barents Sea, and may even extend onto some of the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, spawning sites will be established further north than currently. It is likely that spring migrations will occur earlier, and fall returns will be later. There is the distinct possibility that, where seasonal sea ice disappears altogether, cod will cease their migration. Individual growth rates for many of the cod stocks will increase, leading to in overall increase in the total production of Atlantic cod in the North Atlantic. These responses of cod to future climate changes are highly uncertain, however, as they will also depend on the changes to climate and oceanographic variables besides temperature, such as plankton production, the prey and predator fields, and industrial fishing.

The aim of this study was to examine the independent and interactive effects of long-term stochastic food availability and water temperature on larval survivorship, growth and development of the striped marsh frog, Limnodynastes peronii. Larval L. peronii were reared in conditions of either constant or stochastic food availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26 degrees C), and effects on survival, growth and development were quantified. Over the experimental period, larval growth rate was highest and survivorship lowest at the warmest temperature. However, changes in food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with slower larval growth and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability treatments. Tadpoles in the stochastic food availability treatments did not reach metamorphosis during the experimental period, suggesting that developmental stasis may have been induced by food restriction. Overall, these results demonstrate that changes in food availability alter the effects of water temperature on survival, growth and development. From an applied perspective, understanding how environmental factors interact to cause phenotypic change may assist with amphibian conservation by improving the number of tadpoles generated in captive breeding programmes.									12	1	0	0	12	0	13			2051-1434			WOS:000375198200001	27293714

Knowledge of how this will affect biological systems is still largely restricted to the lower levels of organization (e.g. species range shifts), rather than at the community, food web or ecosystem level, where responses cannot be predicted from studying single species in isolation. Further, many correlational studies are confounded with time and/or space, whereas experiments have been mostly confined to laboratory microcosms that cannot capture the true complexity of natural ecosystems. We used a 'natural experiment' in an attempt to circumvent these shortcomings, by characterizing community structure and trophic interactions in 15 geothermal Icelandic streams ranging in temperature from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C. Even modest temperature increases had dramatic effects across multiple levels of organization, from changes in the mean body size of the top predators, to unimodal responses of species populations, turnover in community composition, and lengthening of food chains. Our results reveal that the rates of warming predicted for the next century have serious implications for the structure and functioning of these fragile 'sentinel' ecosystems across multiple levels of organization.									79	2	0	0	71	0	81			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000278308100007		
J	Gericke, Rebecca L.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.; Fodrie, F.

While range expansions have been documented for a number of species, there is limited information on the ecological impacts of shifts on native species. Recently, abundances of tropically-associated gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) and lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris) have increased in seagrass nurseries in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), concurrent with regional increases in sea surface temperature. We investigated effects of increased abundances of these species on abundance and growth of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), the dominant native species. Because juvenile pinfish and snappers share common prey, predators, and habitat, the high degree of niche overlap suggests an equally high potential for competition. We used a multiple before-after control impact design to determine whether increased snapper abundances significantly affected abundance or growth of pinfish. Trawl surveys at six locations in the northern GOM in summer and fall 2010 were used to calculate pinfish and snapper abundances. We identified three locations with high snapper abundances and three locations with no snapper and compared pinfish abundance and otolith-determined growth rates in these locations before and after snapper recruitment. Paired t tests and two-way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in pinfish abundance or growth in the presence of snappers compared to locations and seasons without snappers. We conclude that range expansions of tropically associated snappers have had no significant effect on abundance or growth of native pinfish in northern GOM seagrass habitats.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000337030300012

However, in most cases a priori knowledge of two key properties of stable isotopes is required, namely their rate of incorporation into the body (incorporation rate) and the change of isotope values between consumers and resources that arises during incorporation of the isotopes into the consumer's tissues (trophic discrimination). Previous studies have quantified these properties across species and tissue types, but little is known about how they vary with temperature, a key driver of many biological rates and times. Here, we explored for the first time how temperature affects both carbon incorporation rate and trophic discrimination via growth rates, using the domestic cricket, Acheta domesticus. We raised crickets at 16 degrees C, 21 degrees C, and 26 degrees C and showed that temperature increased carbon isotope incorporation rate, which was driven by both an increased growth rate and catabolism at higher temperatures. Trophic discrimination of carbon isotopes decreased at higher temperatures, which we attributed to either lower activation energies needed to synthesize non-essential amino acids at higher temperatures or the increased utilization of available resources of consumers at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate that temperature is a key driver of both carbon isotope incorporation rate and trophic discrimination, via mechanisms that likely persist across all ectotherms. Experiments to determine incorporation rates and trophic discrimination factors in ectotherms must include temperature as a major factor, and natural variation in temperature might have significant effects on these isotopic properties that then can affect inferences made from isotope values.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-1910	1879-1611		WOS:000434751100006	29432766

Seabirds were more abundant in the Northwest Atlantic, but biomass was greater in the Northeast. This disparity resulted from enormous numbers of little auks Alle alle breeding in West Greenland and of Leach's storm-petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa breeding in Newfoundland, plus large numbers of non-breeding shearwaters Puffinus spp. entering southern NAFO areas in summer. The Northeast Atlantic communities were dominated numerically by northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis, large auks Uria spp., and the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica. Seabirds occupying the North Atlantic consume approximately 11 X 10(6) t of food annually. Overall consumption rates peak during summer as a result of increased breeding activity and seasonal movements of birds into the North Atlantic. Because of the greater biomass of birds in the northeast, consumption (mainly by piscivores) in ICES areas was approximately 20% higher than that in NAFO areas, where planktivores dominate. NAFO areas had, however, a much greater consumption rate per unit area than ICES areas. Comparative studies such as these could prove informative in assessing large predator responses to the influence of fishing and ocean-scale climate change.

Projected global changes urge the question how this interplay will be affected by browning (increasing input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter), nutrient enrichment and warming. We explored this with a process-based model of a shallow lake food web consisting of benthic and pelagic components (abiotic resources, primary producers, grazers, carnivores), and compared model expectations with the results of a browning and warming experiment in nutrient-poor ponds harboring a boreal lake community. Under low nutrient conditions, the model makes three major predictions. (a) Browning reduces light and increases nutrient supply; this decreases benthic and increases pelagic production, gradually shifting productivity from the benthic to the pelagic habitat. (b) Because of active habitat choice, fish exert top-down control on grazers and benefit primary producers primarily in the more productive of the two habitats. (c) Warming relaxes top-down control of grazers by fish and decreases primary producer biomass, but effects of warming are generally small compared to effects of browning and nutrient supply. Experimental results were consistent with most model predictions for browning: light penetration, benthic algal production, and zoobenthos biomass decreased, and pelagic nutrients and pelagic algal production increased with browning. Also consistent with expectations, warming had negative effects on benthic and pelagic algal biomass and weak effects on algal production and zoobenthos and zooplankton biomass. Inconsistent with expectations, browning had no effect on zooplankton and warming effects on fish depended on browning. The model is applicable also to nutrient-rich systems, and we propose that it is a useful tool for the exploration of the consequences of different climate change scenarios for productivity and food web dynamics in shallow lakes, the worldwide most common lake type.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000456028900011	30430702

For both species, survival of adult sponges was high in all seasons, whereas juvenile sponges had poor survival. Recruitment of Latrunculia sp. nov. occurred in all seasons indicating that this species is reproductively active throughout the year. P. croceus recruited mostly in autumn, supporting previous work that found the sponge to be reproductively active in summer and early autumn only. For both sponge species, growth rates varied greatly between individuals and were unaffected by initial sponge size within the range examined. Sponges generally grew during winter and spring as the water temperature rose, and shrank during summer and autumn as the water temperature fell. This growth pattern may relate to seasonal variation in food abundance, and for P. croceus it may result also from seasonal differences in reproductive investment. After 2 years, Latrunculia sp. nov. and P. croceus had on average, halved and doubled in size, respectively. Latrunculia sp. nov. showed a seasonal pattern of bioactivity, being most active in spring possibly to prevent the surface overgrowth of fouling organisms. P. croceus had no seasonal pattern of bioactivity, but individuals were either very active or inactive.

For example, the correct estimate of recruitment is essential to estimate fish stock abundance. In this Theme Section, 5 papers explore the effect of fishing and climate on population structure across sub-Arctic ecosystems. The studies focus on how temperature- and fishing-induced changes in spatial and demographic population structure affect recruitment and population growth rate. The results suggest common patterns, but also highlight differences in the relative importance of fishing and climate among the populations and ecosystems examined.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000317937600014

Possible tagging effects include impaired competitive performance and predator avoidance. These effects are not easily studied in the laboratory, and field studies include too much variability to test such indirect effects. Predation experiments were conducted in four outdoor ponds to test for the possible effects of transport/handling and tagging by surgical implanting. Pikeperch, Sander lucioperca (L.), were used as predators and trout, Salmo trutta (L.), as prey. The level of predation was highly dependant on water temperature, but no significant difference was seen in the level of predation between any of the treatment and control groups. This can be interpreted as a lack of effect or as a failure to detect such effect under less than field conditions.					7th Conference on Fish Telemetry7th Conference on Fish Telemetry	JUN 17-21, 2007JUN 17-21, 2007		Silkeborg, DENMARKSilkeborg, DENMARK	17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0969-997X			WOS:000260306900006

Spatially explicit in situ simulations that included activity costs associated with feeding were used to examine the effects of chlorophyll patchiness on the energy gain in different zooplankton communities. Simulations were repeated for several zooplankton size classes (small, large, and bulk) and two communities (all copepods and all cladocerans). For each simulated combination, a spatial energetic differential (SED) was estimated by contrasting the energy that zooplankton could gain using observed spatial patterns in chlorophyll and water temperature with the energy they could gain using uniform concentrations of chlorophyll and water temperature. Large zooplankton showed the greatest SED range across all communities, from a decrease of 8% to a maximum increase of 20%, assuming relatively low costs associated with feeding activity. Small zooplankton had the narrowest SED range. Zooplankton energy gain is sensitive to both the degree of zooplankton-chlorophyll spatial overlap and energetic costs associated with zooplankton feeding activity. SED values as high as 485% can occur under plausible estimates of activity costs. Wind-driven increases in spatial overlap between predator and prey can be large enough to substantially alter planktonic trophic interactions.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000283657000010		
J	Harding, Juliana M.								Growth and development of veined rapa whelk Rapana venosa veligers								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				25	3			941	946						DEC 2006	2006	Planktonic larvae of benthic fauna that can grow quickly in the plankton and reduce their larval period duration lessen their exposure to pelagic predators and reduce the potential for advection away from suitable habitats. Veined rapa whelks (Rapana venosa, Muricidae) lay egg masses that release planktonic veliger larvae from May through August in Chesapeake Bay, USA. Two groups of veliger larvae hatched from egg masses during June and August 2000 were cultured in the laboratory. Egg mass incubation time (time from deposition to hatch) ranged from 18-26 d at water temperatures between 22 degrees C and 27 degrees C. Four stages of rapa whelk veliger development along a time series from hatch to settlement were described using external morphological features. Rapa whelk veligers were measured at three-day intervals from hatching through the onset of spontaneous settlement. A four-parameter Gompertz growth model was used with length at age data from cultures of rapa whelk veligers to estimate maximum growth rates for June and August hatched groups. Larval rapa whelks settled at shell lengths of 1.18-1.24 mm after planktonic larval periods ranging from 24-42 d. Maximum larval growth rates observed in August (0.03 mm d(-1)) are 50% lower than maximum larval growth rates observed for June hatched rapa whelk veligers (0.071 mm d(-1)). Daily larval growth rates from hatch to first spontaneous settlement for rapa whelk veligers ranged from 0.002-0.099 mm d(-1) with maximum growth rates occurring between 12-18 d post hatch in June. Larval period duration, or the time from hatch to first spontaneous settlement, was 12 days shorter for June hatched larvae than for August hatched larvae. Water temperature was not significantly correlated with larval growth rates (mm d(-1)) in either June or August. Plasticity in larval period duration may enhance survival and dispersal opportunities for planktonic rapa whelk veligers.									18	4	0	0	16	0	20			0730-8000			WOS:000242839700019

Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0921-2973	1572-9761		WOS:000475643000013

Average monthly water temperature during the year at sites along the river course was in the range 8.5-21 degreesC. The four fish populations' consumption, both in energy and mass units, was lower at sites in the middle course of the river, which was isolated from upstream sites by numerous waterfalls and dams. The gross (K-1) and net (K-2) ecological efficiencies of brown trout, roach and nase were very low, but detritus was their dominant food item. Eel, which ate animal food only had two to three times higher growth efficiencies than other fish. High mean monthly water temperatures from May to August and the isolation effect were probably the causes of a low utilisation of consumed food for growth in the populations investigated.

J	Mortensen, D; Wertheimer, A; Taylor, S; Landingham, J								The relation between early marine growth of pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, and marine water temperature, secondary production, and survival to adulthood								FISHERY BULLETIN				98	2			319	335						APR 2000	2000	Juvenile pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, from four consecutive brood years were tagged as they emigrated to the estuarine waters of Auke Bay, and information was obtained on the relationships between early marine growth, environmental conditions, and survival to adulthood. Juveniles that emigrated from Auke Creek later in the spring spent significantly less time in the estuary. Individual growth rates of tagged fish recovered in Auke Bay ranged from 3.1% to 7.1% per day. In all study years, juvenile pink salmon grew more slowly in early April than in late April and early May. Water temperature and growth were significantly correlated in all years, but growth did not consistently correlate with the biomass of epibenthic prey or zooplankton available to the fish. Comparisons of expected and observed growth rates suggested that low prey availability, as well as low temperatures, may have limited growth for early spring emigrants. Although early emigrants encountered poorer growth conditions, survivors were larger at a given date than later emigrants, their larger size possibly protecting them from size-selective predation. Early marine growth was significantly related to intra-annual cohort survival to adults (r(2)=0.65, P<0.05). Larger fish consistently survived better than their smaller cohorts for all years. Although early marine growth was an important determinate of survival within a cohort of pink salmon, other factors, such as predator abundance, contributed to the large interannual variability observed.									48	0	0	0	44	0	50			0090-0656			WOS:000086688800008

Bioenergetics models can provide a theoretical construct for addressing specific physiological and ecological hypotheses about how individuals may respond; however, many models fail to link energy deficiencies with reproductive consequences, and thus cannotbe used to predict population-level impacts. Here, we present an agent-based, ecophysiological model that simulates the energy balance of adult, female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The input parameters include physiological values and population -wide ranges for the duration and phenology of life history events. Energy intake depends on foraging effort and stochastic prey availability, whereas energy expenditure is calculated from time and behavior-specific demands. The simulated seal selects an activity (forage, nurse pup, molt, rest) based on body condition and life history constraints. At the end of each timestep, the energy budget is balanced, and catabolism or anabolism occurs. Following model development and validation with empirical data, simulations were run to study the responses of individuals to: (1) baseline conditions; and (2) reduced prey availability. As expected, the model replicated the known fluctuations in energetic requirements associated with reproduction and molt. A 10% reduction in prey availability resulted in seals foraging more and resting less. At the end of the year-long simulations, animals in the baseline simulation had significantly higher body masses than animals in the perturbation simulation. The model was successfully used to explore decision-based energy allocation strategies that occur under different energetic stressors and to elucidate how extrinsic conditions can impact individual fitness. Identifying the temporal sensitivities of Weddell seals to predicted anthropogenic changes is a valuable contribution to the study of global change biology and can inform management decisions in polar regions.

We developed models relating grazing rates to characteristics of zooplankton communities, food concentration, and water temperature. Grazing rates were measured in 30 zooplankton communities that differed in biomass, size distribution, and taxonomic composition. Crustaceans grazed per day 2-21 % of the chlorophyll in algae <35-mu-m, which is within the range of most grazing rates measured in other studies. Grazing rates were positively related to zooplankton biomass and negatively related to food concentration, although much variation among communities remains unexplained (R2 = 0. 1 9-0.35). Surprisingly, we could not detect a general relationship between zooplankton size distribution and grazing rate. Communities dominated by large zooplankton (mostly Daphnia and Diaphanosoma) did not tend to have higher grazing rates than communities dominated by small zooplankton. Zooplankton taxonomic composition was significantly related to grazing rates but explained little variation among communities. Grazing rates calculated from published allometric equations were biased, usually overestimating phytoplankton removal by zooplankton.									57	0	0	0	49	0	58			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:A1992JE74700017

Multitrophic interactions mediate the effects of climate change on herbivore abundance								OECOLOGIA				185	2			181	190		10.1007/s00442-017-3934-0				OCT 2017	2017	Climate change can influence the abundance of insect herbivores through direct and indirect mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated multitrophic drivers of herbivore abundance for an aphid species (Aphis helianthi) in a subalpine food web consisting of a host plant (Ligusticum porteri), mutualist ants and predatory lygus bugs (Lygus spp.). We used a model-selection approach to determine which climate and host plant cues best predict year-to-year variation in insect phenology and abundance observed over 6 years. We complemented this observational study with experiments that determined how elevated temperature interacts with (1) host plant phenology and (2) the ant-aphid mutualism to determine aphid abundance. We found date of snowmelt to be the best predictor of yearly abundance of aphid and lygus bug abundance but the direction of this effect differed. Aphids achieved lower abundances in early snowmelt years likely due to increased abundance of lygus bug predators in these years. Elevating temperature of L. porteri flowering stalks reduced their quality as hosts for aphid populations. However, warming aphid colonies on host plants of similar quality increased population growth rates. Importantly, this effect was apparent even in the absence of ants. While we observed fewer ants tending colonies at elevated temperatures, these colonies also had reduced numbers of lygus bug predators. This suggests that mutualism with ants becomes less significant as temperature increases, which contrasts other ant-hemipteran systems. Our observational and experimental results show the importance of multitrophic species interactions for predicting the effect of climate change on the abundances of herbivores.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000412338900002	28891026

In recent decades, Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, has undergone concurrent increases in the availability of the forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) and the number of migratory harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) during the open-water period; however, the impacts of these changes on endemic Arctic species, such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida), have received little attention. We coupled stomach contents with stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of muscle and liver to determine the extent of potential competition between ringed seals (n=91) and harp seals (n=39) in Cumberland Sound. Isotopic niche breadth was greater for ringed seals (95% ellipse: 10.08 parts per thousand(2)) than for harp seals (95% ellipse: 8.00 parts per thousand(2)), and harp seal isotopic niche overlapped more with ringed seal isotopic niche than vice versa, suggesting asymmetrical competition potential. Although there was high overlap in isotopic niche breadth (range 50.3-91.0%) and prey species consumed (Schoener's Index 0.60), stomach content analysis revealed differences in prey species proportions and size composition, thereby reducing the degree of realized niche overlap. Harp seals consumed a higher biomass of fish (66.7%) than did ringed seals (31.9%), and harp seals also consumed larger capelin (64-200mm), polar cod (Boreogadus saida; 28-194mm), and Liparidae (55-115mm) than ringed seals (63-154mm, 20-189mm, and 16-128mm, respectively). With climate change and range shifts predicted to continue into the future, our results provide an important baseline for future studies examining interspecific interactions.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000475657500004

The model, developed for age-0 sturgeon, combines information on functional feeding response, bioenergetics and swimming ability to regulate consumption and growth within a virtual foraging arena. Empirical data on water temperature, water velocity and prey density were obtained from three sites in the Missouri River and used as inputs in the model to evaluate hypotheses concerning factors affecting pallid sturgeon growth. The model was also used to evaluate the impacts of environmental heterogeneity and water velocity on individual growth variability, foraging success and dispersal ability. Growth was simulated for a period of 100 days using 100 individuals (first feeding; 19 mm and 0.035 g) per scenario. Higher growth was shown to occur at sites where high densities of Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae larvae occurred throughout the growing season. Highly heterogeneous habitats (i.e., wide range of environmental conditions) and moderate water velocities (0.3 m/s) were also found to positively affect growth rates. The model developed here provides an important management and conservation tool for evaluating growth hypotheses and(or) identifying habitats in the Missouri River that are favourable to age-0 pallid sturgeon growth.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000417191100018

The most notable aspects of the population dynamics of C. hemisphaerica in Southampton Water were the considerable interannual variation in peak abundance-10.65 m(-3) in 1990 and 2.44 m(-3) in 1991-and temporal patterns of mean bell diameter. The suggestion of almost continuous reproduction in 1990, as indicated by high abundance and large size range on each sampling date, is in contrast to 1991, where at the Cracknore site, five cohorts were produced at 21 d to 80 d intervals. The maximum bell diameter attained in each generation was typically 10-11 mm. At the Cracknore site in 1991, in situ bed diameter growth was linear within each cohort. A trend of increased growth rate with each subsequent cohort, from 26 mu g DW d(-1) to 106 mu g DW d(-1) was coincident with increasing water temperature. Annual production ranged from 0.98 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) to 1.08 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) in 1990 and 0.35 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) to 0.48 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) in 1991.

J	Hessen, Dag O.; Daufresne, Martin; Leinaas, Hans P.								Temperature-size relations from the cellular-genomic perspective								BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				88	2			476	489		10.1111/brv.12006				MAY 2013	2013	A family of empirically based ecological rules', collectively known as temperature-size rules, predicts larger body size in colder environments. This prediction is based on studies demonstrating that a wide range of ectotherms show increased body size, cell size or genome size in low-temperature habitats, or that individuals raised at low temperature become larger than conspecifics raised at higher temperature. There is thus a potential for reduction in size with global warming, affecting all levels from cell volume to body size, community composition and food webs. Increased body size may be obtained either by increasing the size or number of cells. Processes leading to changed cell size are of great interest from an ecological, physiological and evolutionary perspective. Cell size scales with fundamental properties such as genome size, growth rate, protein synthesis rates and metabolic activity, although the causal directions of these correlations are not clear. Changes in genome size will thus, in many cases, not only affect cell or body size, but also life-cycle strategies. Symmetrically, evolutionary drivers of life-history strategies may impact growth rate and thus cell size, genome size and metabolic rates. Although this goes to the core of many ecological processes, it is hard to move from correlations to causations. To the extent that temperature-driven changes in genome size result in significant differences among populations in body size, allometry or life-cycle events such as mating season, it could serve as a fast route to speciation. We offer here a novel perspective on the temperature-size rules from a bottom-up' perspective: how temperature may induce changes in genome size, and thus implicitly in cell size and body size of metazoans. Alternatively: how temperature-driven enlargement of cells also dictates genome-size expansion to maintain the genome-size to cell-volume ratio. We then discuss the different evolutionary drivers in aquatic versus terrestrial systems, and whether it is possible to arrive at a unifying theory that also may serve as a predictive tool related to temperature changes. This, we believe, will offer an updated review of a basic concept in ecology, and novel perspectives on the basic biological responses to temperature changes from a genomic perspective.									51	2	1	0	43	0	53			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000317067900013	23551915

In many Great Lakes tributaries, steelhead spawning and nursery habitats are limited by hydropower dams, and natural recruitment may be supplemented by habitats in adjacent coldwater creeks. In 1998-2001, we investigated the potential for natural production of steelhead in the Muskegon River, Michigan, a tributary to Lake Michigan, through analysis of parr diet categories, consumption, growth, survival, and production in the main-stem Muskegon River and in Bigelow Creek. We used electrofishing surveys to estimate Parr growth and survival from changes in fish weight and density over time. We estimated diet from gut content analysis and consumption from bioenergetics model analysis. Average fall density of part in Bigelow Creek was 20-fold higher than in the Muskegon River. Average summer daily mortality rate of Parr in the Muskegon River was nearly threefold higher than in Bigelow Creek. Overwinter mortality rates of Parr were low in both habitats. Few yearling and older parr were present in the Muskegon River relative to Bigelow Creek. Age-0 Parr primarily consumed benthic invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate prey densities were sufficient to support high parr growth rates in both rivers. Parr grew at similar rates but consumed 84% more per day in the Muskegon River, which had higher water temperatures than Bigelow Creek. Age-0 production was fivefold higher in Bigelow Creek than in the Muskegon River. High mortalities of parr in the Muskegon River were correlated with summer water temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C. Average summer temperatures in Bigelow Creek (17 degrees C) were optimal for Parr survival. Our results were consistent with data from other Great Lakes tributaries and suggest that small tributary creek habitats contribute disproportionately to steelhead recruitment from large impounded watersheds by providing optimal thermal refugia for Parr during summer.									15	0	0	0	16	0	16			0275-5947			WOS:000246970200019		
J	Rikardsen, AH; Amundsen, PA; Bodin, PJ								Growth and diet of anadromous Arctic charr after their return to freshwater								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				12	1			74	80		10.1034/j.1600-0633.2003.00001.x				MAR 2003	2003	The post smolt of anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus ) from Lake Storvatn, northern Norway (70degrees39'48'), continued to feed and grow after their return to freshwater in late summer, but in late autumn (October) both their growth rate and feeding intensity ceased along with the drop in water temperature. In contrast, adult, sexually mature anadromous charr did not appear to feed during their freshwater residency. The stomach fullness of post smolts were similar to that of resident Arctic charr during early autumn, and their diets were similar, being dominated by pelagic prey such as surface insects, Holopedium sp., Bosmina sp. and chironomid pupae. Later in the autumn, the resident charr also included some more benthic prey, in particular gastropods, whereas the post smolts continued to feed predominantly on zooplankton and surface insects, but with a lower stomach fullness than the resident fish. This suggests that after arrival in freshwater, the post smolts continue their pelagic feeding behaviour displayed during the sea-migration.									25	0	0	0	24	0	25			0906-6691			WOS:000180927000004

The invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus is a brackish-water adapted invader with high predatory and competitive impacts on native communities. We test the hypothesis that both body mass gain and predation rates of the round goby are reduced in low-dissolved ion waters in which they can establish, using calcium (Ca2+) as a focal ion of great importance to the physiology of aquatic animals. Round gobies were first acclimated for 36 days on a diet of shrimp pellets in either high (35 mg L-1) or low (12 mg L-1) Ca2+ concentration [Ca]. We then assessed the functional response (FR)-the relationship between predation rate and prey supply-of the round goby from high and low [Ca] on amphipod prey in either condition. Round gobies in high [Ca] consumed more pellets during the acclimation period and gained more mass compared to fish in low-[Ca] conditions. Functional response experiments revealed that round gobies at high-[Ca] levels for both acclimation and FR experiments had the highest predatory impact, whereas fish in low-[Ca] FR treatments had similarly low predation rates regardless of acclimation [Ca]. In a second experiment, non-acclimated round gobies had a higher FR on mayfly nymph prey at high [Ca] than fish at low-[Ca] levels. Our results indicate that the round goby has stronger ecological impacts in conditions that are more physiologically optimal for the species. Identifying key physico-chemical factors that mediate impacts of invaders would help prioritize habitats for management attention.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000361797900014

Maximum consumption rate (C-max, micrograms per hour) increased exponentially with walleye mean length whereas the prey abundance at which 90% of C-max is attained (D-90, prey per litre) increased initially and then declined with mean length. Prey size had no significant effect on C-max whereas D-90 declined significantly with increasing prey size. Selection for relatively larger prey and selection for large cladocerans relative to cyclopoid copepods increased significantly with walleye mean length. Walleye larvae consistently selected most strongly for relatively uncommon prey. Selection for relatively smaller prey and selection for cyclopoid copepods relative to large cladocerans increased significantly with total prey abundance in field studies and some laboratory studies. Variance in prey selection showed a significant, negative relationship with prey abundance in laboratory studies. Selection for medium (greater than or equal to 0.3-0.6 mm body width) relative to smalt (<0.3 mm) prey declined significantly with increasing temperature in field studies. Our results suggest that the feeding success of walleye larvae may be limited by both the abundance and size composition of the zooplankton communities in natural environments.									24	2	0	0	24	0	26			0706-652X			WOS:A1994QF32000019

We develop a simple mathematical model that shows one method to measure, quantitatively, the magnitude of the shift. Under different temperature regimes we compute the intersection of two regions in a joint phenology space: the region where temporal interactions can occur and the region where particular-sized predators consume particular-sized prey. The area of the intersection provides a numerical value for measuring the effective interaction. A comparison of the areas for different temperature histories defines an index, or yardstick, for quantitatively assessing the effects of temperature variations on phenological shifts.

Stage IV shrimp larvae that were offered a natural zooplankton assemblage showed a significant trend of linearly increasing predation over the full range of 3 to 250 prey l(-1). This followed the Holling type I functional response model. Individual Stage IV shrimp larvae ingested up to 14 prey d(-1) at the highest initial prey concentration offered (250 prey l(-1)). Temperature effects were investigated with Stage 11 shrimp larvae as predators. The predation rate increased significantly, from 11 (at 3degreesC) to 21 (at 5degreesC) prey per predator d(-1), but stayed stable at 24 prey per predator d(-1) at 8degreesC. The majority of the prey eaten by the Stage II shrimp larvae were small (copepod nauplii; other invertebrate eggs and nauplii) while those eaten by the Stage IV larvae were larger (Calanus finmarchicus CI, CII, CIII and body parts of CIV, CV, CVI). However, Stage IV larvae also ate small prey (copepod eggs and nauplii, other invertebrate nauplii).									17	0	0	0	16	0	18			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000188774900014

YOY of both species also showed decreased feeding rates, as did V. hispanica adults. Adult V. hispanica also were more aggressive themselves and had their reproductive behaviour disrupted. Cases of eastern mosquitofish predation on small A. iberus were also observed. The occurrence and intensity of these potentially harmful effects, however, seemed to be modulated by water temperature, reproductive condition, relative size of the interacting fishes and species-specific habitat preferences. Thus, aggression almost disappeared at low water temperatures. Valencia hispanica and eastern mosquitofish used similar vertical positions in the water column and this apparently increased the frequency of their interactions. In contrast, A. iberus preferred positions closer to the bottom than the other two species and this vertical segregation appeared to lead to less direct interaction with eastern mosquitofish. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, under semi-natural conditions, the presence of eastern mosquitofish resulted in an almost 70% reduction in the number of offspring produced by A. iberus. The addition of extra, non-breeding males of A. iberus had no significant effect. YOY A. iberus from cages with eastern mosquitofish or extra males were significantly smaller (c. I mm, or 8% shorter) than those from cages without additional fish. Results for V hispanica were not conclusive, as very few YOY were recovered. In contrast, eastern mosquitofish did not affect the survivorship of breeding adults of both native species. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Diet and bioenergetics of lake-rearing juvenile Chinook salmon in Lake Washington								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				135	6			1580	1591		10.1577/T05-178.1				NOV 2006	2006	Use of lake habitats by ocean-type Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha is rare under natural conditions. We studied aspects of the trophic ecology of naturally and hatchery-produced juvenile Chinook salmon rearing in the littoral zone of highly urbanized Lake Washington in Washington State. During February through May, naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon occupied littoral habitats and consumed mostly epibenthic prey, primarily chironomid pupae (Diptera). In June, they switched to a diet dominated by plankton. specifically Daphnia spp. This diet shift from littoral prey to limnetic prey coincided with increasing temperature, a shift by the fish from littoral to linmetic habitats, the spring bloom of Daphnia, and increasing fish size. Bioenergetics modeling for these populations estimated that naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon had high consumption rates and were generally feeding close to their maximum ration, even after large numbers of hatchery-produced Chinook salmon entered the lake. The feeding rates, growth rates, and proportions of maximum daily ration from the modeling suggested that under current conditions, both naturally produced and hatchery-produced juvenile Chinook salmon were finding ample food in littoral habitats of Lake Washington. These results further reveal that hatchery-produced Chinook salmon did not compete with naturally produced fish and that this was probably a result of hatchery juveniles entering the lake during the spring Daphnia bloom when this prey is abundant. Our results suggest that managers should focus Chinook salmon recovery efforts in the Lake Washington basin on other aspects of the species' lake use, such as predation or disease. or on other life stages (e.g., spawning adults).									35	0	0	0	34	1	35			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000243345500014

One possible mechanism that might explain this phenomenon is related to trophic limitation. After the spring phytoplankton bloom macrozoobenthic infauna becomes less active above the sediment, thereby affecting the time spent by predatory flatfish on searching for prey and hence, causing a reduction in food intake and in growth. Here, our aim is to gather evidence to substantiate this so-called "summer growth reduction" hypothesis by analyzing summer growth for 0-group flounder Platichdtys fiesus at the Balgzand intertidal area in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, under the prediction that flounder, as a more epibenthic predator, would suffer less or not at all from summer growth reduction in contrast to 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa, a more benthic feeder. Summer growth was studied for three contrasting years with respect to preceding winter water temperature conditions (cold, average and warm year) to exclude possible irreversible non-genetic adaptation of growth to water temperature conditions. Growth performance was analyzed by combining information on individual growth based on otolith daily ring analysis with predictions of maximum growth (= under optimal food conditions) based on a Dynamic Energy Budget model. In line with expectations and in contrast to 0-group plaice, no trend in growth performance over time was found suggesting that 0-group flounder showed no growth reduction after summer, providing further basis for a future testing of the trophic limitation hypothesis.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1385-1101	1873-1414		WOS:000456758400005

This study aimed to quantify the ingestion and clearance rates of bacteria by ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) in a subtropical freshwater reservoir (Monjolinho reservoir - Sao Carlos - Brazil) during one year period, in order to verify their importance as consumers and controllers of bacteria in two seasons, a dry/cold and a rainy/warm one. For this purpose, in situ bacterivory experiments were carried out bimonthly using fluorescently labeled bacteria with 5-(4,6 diclorotriazin-2yl) aminofluorescein (DTAF). Although ciliates have shown the highest individual ingestion and clearance rates, bacterivory was dominated by HNF, who showed higher population ingestion rates (mean of 9,140 bacteria h(-1) mL(-1)) when compared to ciliates (mean of 492 bacteria h(-1) mL(-1)). The greater predation impact on bacterial communities was caused mainly by the small HNF (<5 mu m) population, especially in the rainy season, probably due to the abundances of these organisms, the precipitation, trophic index state and water temperature that were higher in this period. Thus, the protozoan densities together with environmental variables were extremely relevant in determining the seasonal pattern of bacterivory in Monjolinho reservoir.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1517-8382	1678-4405		WOS:000338109800020	24948925

Predator assemblages were created using a substitutive design to give three single-species treatments (low diversity) and one three-species treatment (high diversity) under two temperature treatments (current seasonal temperature and an increase of + 3 degrees C over current temperatures).The results obtained indicate a shift from substitutive to complementarity effects among predatory species with experimental warming. Experimental warming revealed complementarity between the predatory species in diverse assemblages because higher predation rates on both prey species were found in the high diversity treatment compared with what was expected based on low diversity treatments at the same temperature.Our analyses of prey selectivity provided evidence that resource-niche partitioning is involved in the emergence of functional complementarity under warming. The present study highlights the importance of maintaining diverse predator assemblages if we want to increase natural pest control services in agroecosystems and reduce dependence on agrochemicals in a climate change context.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000391954400007

We studied the effect of different CO2 levels on the aphid predator Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer fed either specialist or generalist aphids reared on either of two host plants under laboratory conditions. In the host plant that contains sinigrin (black mustard), elevated CO2 increased the sinigrin content of both host plant and the specialist aphid, but reduced the already very low levels in the generalist aphid. Predator development time increased with elevated CO2, while fecundity decreased. Consequently, individual fitness decreased slightly with increasing atmospheric CO2. Sinigrin significantly decreased fecundity and increased development time of the predator. As a result, fitness was significantly lower too. The consumption rate was influenced significantly by plant and prey solely and the interactions of host plant x prey type and CO2 level x prey type. Further research on the effects of climate change parameters (e.g. greenhouse gases such as CO2, ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), etc.) separately and jointly under controlled environmental conditions will help to understand the nature and direction of their effects on natural enemies as part of the tritrophic system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1343-8786	1479-8298		WOS:000436767700002		
J	Sonnenholzner, J								Seasonal variation in the food composition of Holothuria theeli(Holothuroidea : aspidochirotida) with observations on density and distribution patterns at the central coast of Ecuador								BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE				73	3			527	543						NOV 2003	2003	The seasonal variability of the ingested matter found in the digestive tract of the burrowing holothurian Holothuria theeli (Aspidochirotida) was studied on a shallow tidal reef flat at the Puntilla Santa Elena, Ecuador in 1994. H. theeli attained its maximum density at lowest tidal level (0 m) with 3.05 ind m(-2) and was concentrated in shallow tide pools. Holothuria theeli fed on invertebrates and microscopic algae. 65% of the gut contents consisted of eight zoobenthic groups, where the most dominant species were meiobenthic crustaceans (46.5%, of which 35.5% were harpacticoid copepods), and microphytobenthos (35%, of which 91% were diatoms). May was the transition period (during water temperature changes) in which the population was dormant after spawning. The seasonal variation in the quantity and type of ingested matter may be related to several related factors, such as: (1) availability of food resources, (2) high food consumption rate in the dry season for energy storage to offset the lean rainy season, and (3) high energetic needs for reproductive activities. Holothuria theeli is a non-selective generalist species, which probably plays an important role in determining benthic community structure in the rocky intertidal at the central coast off Ecuador.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0007-4977	1553-6955		WOS:000220888300001

Settlement of metamorphosing plaice in size between 9 and 14 mm TL was observed from the first sampling at the end of May. Over the survey period, densities increased to maximum numbers of about 10 individuals per 100 m(2) at the end of June. Hereafter, numbers declined steadily until the end of September. The growth rate of juvenile plaice over the period June-August was estimated to be 0.6 mm d(-1), which appeared to be maximal and only determined by prevailing water temperatures. Instantaneous mortality was estimated to be in the order of 0.03 d(-1). Due to the almost complete absence of predatory crustaceans, this mortality is assumed to be caused by fish and bird predation.

In particular, bioenergetics models are increasingly applied to evaluate conditions that vary on subdaily time steps, such as vertical migrations that influence thermal experience and fluvial alterations that increase diurnal temperature variability. However, because the algorithms that describe the relationship between temperature and physiological rates are often nonlinear, using inputs of daily mean temperatures can result in underestimation or overestimation of growth and energetic demand. We used simulations of daily and subdaily models of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha as an example to demonstrate that the nonlinear, temperature-dependent algorithms for consumption and respiration induce large differences in growth between constant-and fluctuating-temperature conditions (despite the same mean daily temperature); these differences increase with high diurnal variability and as temperatures approach the thermal optimum for the species. To correct for model bias in growth, we propose an integrated temperature-scaling algorithm that allows application of the daily model to systems where daily temperatures exhibit considerable subdaily variation. This approach can also be used for any bioenergetics model that includes nonlinear, temperature-dependent algorithms and should be considered when modeled temperatures approach inflection points in nonlinear relationships.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000374323600011		
J	Wesp, HM; Gibb, AC								Do endangered razorback suckers have poor larval escape performance relative to introduced rainbow trout?								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				132	6			1166	1178		10.1577/T02-069				NOV 2003	2003	Poor recruitment has generated the hypothesis that the endangered razorback sucker Xyrauchen texanus is particularly vulnerable to predation early in its life history. We compared the escape responses of razorback suckers, which are adapted to the historically warm waters of the Colorado River, with those of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, an introduced coldwater species, throughout early development at water temperatures of 12degreesC and 18degreesC. We quantified escape performance using maximum velocity, acceleration, and time to maximum velocity and acceleration. Both species showed complete temperature compensation for escape performance; individuals reared at 12degreesC performed as well as those reared at 18degreesC. Performance was also similar between species, although two variables exhibited a species X size interaction. Small razorback suckers were faster (greater maximum velocity and acceleration) than small rainbow trout, while large larvae performed similarly. We also determined that razorback sucker larval escape performance falls within the range reported for other fishes. Therefore, we conclude that razorback suckers do not have "poor" escape performance and that temperature does not directly cause decreased performance. However, a cold temperature reduces growth rates and delays razorback suckers' attainment of a "predator-proof" size. Small larvae are also more likely to perform uncoordinated, ineffective escape responses.

We investigated the effects of two daily temperature profiles during preimaginal development (larval and pupal) and the young adult period (first 10 d) on body weight and fat body content of adult Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) fed English grain aphids [Sitobion avenae (F.)] ad libitum: 1) normal, i.e., current daily temperatures in central Europe (T0: mean, 17.8 degrees C; maximum, 21.8 degrees C; minimum, 13.4 degrees C) and 2) increased by 3K (T3: mean, 20.8 degrees C; maximum, 25.5 degrees C; minimum, 15.7 degrees C). The first experiment was performed at the same temperatures (T0 or T3) during both periods to establish the responses of the two species to temperature. The second was conducted to identify the period (preimaginal or adult) in which the responses occurred and to confirm the results of the first experiment. Compared with normal temperatures (T0), elevated temperatures (T3) resulted in significant decreases in preimaginal development time and increases in aphid consumption rates in both species. C. septempunctata (10-d-old adults) had the highest weights when reared at T3, H. axyridis at T0. C. septempunctata was significantly heavier than H. axyridis in most cases, particularly in females. The body fat content of C. septempunctata was higher than that of H. axyridis at T0 and T3 temperatures. At T3 temperatures, fat accumulation in C. septempunctata increased, whereas that in H. axyridis remained relatively low. Body weight and fat body content of 10-d-old adults of both species seemed to be determined by temperature conditions during preimaginal development.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0046-225X			WOS:000305475600031	22732627	
J	Kroeker, Kristy J.; Sanford, Eric; Jellison, Brittany M.; Gaylord, Brian								Predicting the Effects of Ocean Acidification on Predator-Prey Interactions: A Conceptual Framework Based on Coastal Molluscs								BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN				226	3			211	222		10.1086/BBLv226n3p211				JUN 2014	2014	The influence of environmental change on species interactions will affect population dynamics and community structure in the future, but our current understanding of the outcomes of species interactions in a high-CO2 world is limited. Here, we draw upon emerging experimental research examining the effects of ocean acidification on coastal molluscs to provide hypotheses of the potential impacts of high-CO2 on predator-prey interactions. Coastal molluscs, such as oysters, mussels, and snails, allocate energy among defenses, growth, and reproduction. Ocean acidification increases the energetic costs of physiological processes such as acid-base regulation and calcification. Impacted molluscs can display complex and divergent patterns of energy allocation to defenses and growth that may influence predator-prey interactions; these include changes in shell properties, body size, tissue mass, immune function, or reproductive output. Ocean acidification has also been shown to induce complex changes in chemoreception, behavior, and inducible defenses, including altered cue detection and predator avoidance behaviors. Each of these responses may ultimately alter the susceptibility of coastal molluscs to predation through effects on predator handling time, satiation, and search time. While many of these effects may manifest as increases in per capita predation rates on coastal molluscs, the ultimate outcome of predator-prey interactions will also depend on how ocean acidification affects the specified predators, which also exhibit complex responses to ocean acidification. Changes in predator-prey interactions could have profound and unexplored consequences for the population dynamics of coastal molluscs in a high-CO2 ocean.									64	2	0	0	55	1	66			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000341727200005	25070866

In this study, naturally produced juvenile Snake River fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were fed daily ration levels of 1, 4, or 8% of their body weight and exposed to either constant temperatures (10-14 degrees C) or fluctuating temperatures that mimicked the heating rate (1.5 degrees C/h) and maximum daily temperatures (19-23 degrees C) of entrapment pools that form along the shoreline downstream of Hells Canyon Dam when river flows are altered to meet electric power demand. The survival rate for all groups was 99.9%, and there was no evidence that juvenile fall Chinook salmon fed reduced rations and exposed to constant temperatures grew to a greater extent than juvenile fall Chinook salmon exposed to fluctuating temperatures. The only exception was with the 1% ration level in which juvenile fall Chinook salmon that were exposed to a constant 10 degrees C added more weight over the 14-d exposure period (1% of body weight per day [WT/d]) than fish exposed to temperatures that fluctuated from 10 degrees C to 19.0 degrees C (0.3% WT/d) and from 10 degrees C to 22 degrees C daily (0% WT/d). We conclude that the lack of difference in growth rates between the fluctuating and constant temperature regimes at daily ration levels of at least 4% stems from the facts that the rate of temperature change in this study was within the acclimation range for growth, the daily average temperatures were less than thermal optimum values, and the temperature amplitudes were within lethal limits.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000288280100017

Modelling conservation management options for a southern range-margin population of Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria vulnerable to climate change								IBIS				153	2			345	356		10.1111/j.1474-919X.2011.01108.x				APR 2011	2011	There is considerable interest in understanding how management may help species and populations cope with climate change (climate change adaptation). I used a population model describing the demography of a southern range-margin European Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria population vulnerable to climate change to assess the potential benefits associated with site-based adaptation management. Two forms of management were simulated: (1) counteracting management to reduce the severity of the negative climate change impacts, simulated by increasing tipulid (cranefly) abundance, and (2) compensatory management to increase populations through an alternative mechanism, simulated by manipulating nest and chick predation rates. A 1 degrees C rise was estimated to require a doubling of cranefly abundance, or a 35% increase in nest and chick survival rates, to maintain a stable population. For a 2 degrees C rise, a four-fold increase in craneflies or an 80% increase in survival rates would be required for population stability. A model based on likely realistic estimates of the magnitude of benefit associated with both adaptation management options showed that combined, they may significantly reduce the severity of population decline and risk of extinction associated with a relatively large increase in temperature of 5.8 degrees C above 1960-90 levels. Site-based adaptation management may therefore increase the resistance of Golden Plovers to some degree of future climate change. This model framework for informing climate change adaptation decisions should be developed for other species and habitats.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			0019-1019			WOS:000288507100011

The variability in growth rates of natural and enclosure-reared young-of-the-year yellow perch could be explained by the availability of benthic and/or planktonic prey (R(2) = 0.093-0.098). Mean annual water temperature and cumulative degree-days did not add to the explanatory power of the relationships. The faster growing natural cohorts included more benthos in their diet; however, benthos is not necessary to sustain the highest growth rates because the fastest growth rates were observed in enclosure cohorts that lacked benthic invertebrates. Cohorts in lakes and enclosures that had a high proportion of Daphnia in the zooplankton community also supported higher first-year growth rates. The results of the enclosure experiment suggest that the dominant mechanism creating growth variability is density-dependent intra-age-class competition. Our empirical results, when coupled with a simple model, suggest that the assumption of a negative relationship between energetic costs of foraging and prey abundance, on a daily time scale, is the most appropriate because it acts to amplify growth variability across ranges of prey abundance.									30	0	0	0	30	0	30			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:A1994QY71700011

Climate change is expected to influence life history and trophic interactions among plants, whiteflies and their natural enemies. Here, we review the potential impacts of climate change on whiteflies and the likely consequences for agricultural systems. This review concludes that while climatic stress tends to negatively affect life history traits, the effects differ with the tolerance of the whiteflies and the amount of stress experienced. Whiteflies also differ in their adaptability. Better adapted species will likely experience increased distribution and abundance provided their tolerance limits are not exceeded, while species with lower tolerance and adaptation limits will suffer reduced fitness, which will have overall effects on their distribution and abundance in space and time. The majority of methods used to control whiteflies will still be useful especially if complementary methods are combined for maximum efficacy. Parasitism and predation rates of whitefly natural enemies could increase with temperature within the optimum ranges of the natural enemies, although life history traits and population growth potential are generally maximised below 30 degrees C. Changes in climatic suitability modifying the distribution and abundance of whiteflies, and environmental suitability for plant viruses, will likely affect epidemics of viral diseases. Greater efforts are required to improve understanding of the complex effects of climate change on multi-species and multi-trophic interactions in the agro-ecological systems inhabited by whiteflies, and to use this new knowledge to develop robust and climate-smart management strategies.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000463146700002

Bernhardt, Joey R./0000-0003-1824-2801			Species interactions mediate thermal evolution								EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS				12	7	SI		1463	1474		10.1111/eva.12805				AUG 2019	2019	Understanding whether populations and communities can evolve fast enough to keep up with ongoing climate change is one of the most pressing issues in biology today. A growing number of studies have documented rapid evolutionary responses to warming, suggesting that populations may be able to persist despite temperature increases. The challenge now is to better understand how species interactions, which are ubiquitous in nature, mediate these population responses to warming. Here, we use laboratory natural selection experiments in a freshwater community to test hypotheses related to how thermal evolution of Daphnia pulex to two selection temperatures (12 and 18 degrees C) is mediated by rapid thermal evolution of its algal resource (Scenedesmus obliquus) or by the presence of the zooplankton predator Chaoborus americanus. We found that cold-evolved algae (a high-quality resource) facilitated the evolution of increased thermal plasticity in Daphnia populations selected at 12 degrees C, for both body size and per capita growth rates (r). Conversely, warm-evolved algae facilitated the evolution of increased r thermal plasticity for Daphnia selected at 18 degrees C. Lastly, we found that the effect of selection temperature on evolved Daphnia body size was more pronounced when Daphnia were also reared with predators. These data demonstrate that trait evolution of a focal population to the thermal environment can be affected by both bottom-up and top-down species interactions and that rapid temperature evolution of a resource can have cascading effects on consumer thermal evolution. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating species interactions when estimating ecological and evolutionary responses of populations and communities to ongoing temperature warming.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1752-4571			WOS:000480580300017	31417627

The banks of West Greenland are located in a climate sensitive area and are likely to elicit pronounced responses to oceanographic changes in the North Atlantic. The recent increase in sea temperatures on the banks of West Greenland has had cascading effects on sea ice coverage, residency of top predators, and abundance of important prey species like Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Here, we report on the response of one of the top predators in West Greenland; the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). The porpoises depend on locating high densities of prey species with high nutritive value and they have apparently responded to the general warming on the banks of West Greenland by longer residence times, increased consumption of Atlantic cod resulting in improved body condition in the form of larger fat deposits in blubber, compared to the situation during a cold period in the 1990s. This is one of the few examples of a measurable effect of climate change on a marine mammal population.									19	0	0	0	19	0	19			2045-7758			WOS:000312441500012	22393524	
J	Frank, Thomas; Bramboeck, Martin								Predatory beetles feed more pest beetles at rising temperature								BMC ECOLOGY				16						21	10.1186/s12898-016-0076-x				APR 15 2016	2016	Background: Climate warming is a challenge for many plants and animals as they have to respond to rising temperature. Rising temperature was observed to affect herbivores and predators. Activity-density of abundant predatory carabid beetles, which are considered important natural control agents of agricultural pests, was observed to increase at rising temperature. The pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus is one of the most important insect pests in European oilseed rape fields, and its larvae were observed to be important prey to carabid beetles. Therefore, we performed a laboratory experiment to detect whether rising temperature affects the number of pollen beetle larvae killed by five abundant carabids, and larval biomass ingested by carabids. In three climate chambers actual temperature (T1) was compared to temperatures increased by 3 degrees C (T2) and 5 degrees C (T3). This is the first study investigating the feeding of carabid predators on an arable pest insect spanning a realistic forecasted climate warming scenario of 3 and 5 degrees C, thus providing basic knowledge on that neglected research area. We hypothesized that carabids kill more pollen beetle larvae at rising temperature, and biomass intake by carabids increases with rising temperature.Results: Both beetle species and temperature had significant effects on the number of killed Meligethes larvae and larval biomass ingested by carabids. Amara ovata, Harpalus distinguendus and Poecilus cupreus killed significantly more pollen beetle larvae at T2 and T3 compared to T1. Anchomenus dorsalis killed significantly more larvae at T2 than T1, and Harpalus affinis showed no significant differences among temperatures. Biomass intake by A. ovata, H. distinguendus and A. dorsalis was significantly larger at T2 and T3 compared to T1. Biomass intake by H. affinis and P. cupreus did not significantly differ among temperatures. Among the five carabids tested P. cupreus exhibited the highest values for both number of killed larvae and biomass intake.Conclusions: Our lab results suggest a clear potential for higher feeding of pollen beetle larvae by carabid beetles at rising temperature. As rising temperature leads to increased activity of abundant arable carabids in the field, it may be expected that there is enhanced pest suppression under warmer field conditions.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8				1472-6785		WOS:000374458800001	27084775

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				98	3			801	809		10.1007/s10641-014-0316-x				MAR 2015	2015	Annual and spatial variations in the growth condition of the arabesque greenling (Pleurogrammus azonus) were examined in relation to temperature and food availability. We found age-dependent effects of temperature and sex-dependent effects of zooplankton biomass on the growth condition. Growth condition increased with bottom temperature in the 1+ group, but this effect was reversed in the older groups. This age-dependent effect of temperature on growth condition was consistent with regional differences in growth patterns. Arabesque greenling living in cool sea areas reached a larger final adult size (i.e. larger L (a)), but the juveniles grew slower (i.e. smaller k) than those living in warm sea areas. Based on our results, we suggest that the negative effect of climate warming on growth condition might be more severe for older individuals and that a climate change-driven decrease in the somatic growth of adult fish could bring a population growth rate decline through maternal effects.									5	0	0	0	5	1	5			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000349029800005

Elevated CO2 does not exacerbate nutritional stress in larvae of a Pacific flatfish								FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY				26	3			336	349		10.1111/fog.12195				MAY 2017	2017	Multiple aspects of climate change are expected to co-occur such that ocean acidification will take place in conjunction with warming and a range of trophic changes. Previous studies have demonstrated that nutritional condition plays a significant role in the responses of invertebrates to ocean acidification, but similar studies have yet to be conducted with marine fishes. In this study, we examined the potential interactive effects of elevated CO2 levels and nutritional stress on the growth and development of northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra). Separate experiments examined the effects of these two environmental stressors during the pre-flexion (3-31days) and post-flexion (31-87days) larval stages. In both stages, the larval feeding regime has a much larger impact on growth rates than did the CO2 level, and there was no observed interaction between stressors. By 31days post-hatch, larvae in the high-feeding treatment were 84.2% heavier than the fish in the low-feeding treatments, but there was no significant effect of CO2 level on body size or condition. While overall growth rates were faster during the pre-flexion stage, the effects of food limitation were greater for post-flexion larvae undergoing metamorphosis, with the high-feeding treatment fish being 3.3 times as heavy as fish in the low-feeding treatments. These results have important implications for understanding the impacts of the multi-faceted nature of climate change on population productivity of commercial fish species in the North Pacific.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000398608600006

S. compacta and S. manchuricus are univoltine with direct embryonic development and slow nymphal growth during 311 and 294 days, respectively, including the growth at low water temperatures in winter. The life history of S. compacta was characterized by the synchronous emergence and recruitment of its population, continuous increase in the nymphal body weight from May to September, rapid growth in October-November, and the sustained weight gain during winter months until emergence in April-May The life history of S. manchuricus was distinguished by the long-term emergence in May-July and the recruitment of the population from July to September, as well as by a wide range of age-length features, presumably related to the specificity of the reproductive system in adults and an external delay of the nymphal growth of early instars at high water temperature in late summer and early autumn. Nymphs of S. manchuricus grow actively at 0.2 degrees C in winter providing a competitive advantage for this species over S. compacta and K. exilis. The growth of the latter slowed down or was absent in winter months. The semivoltine life history of K exilis, with a diapause in the embryonic development during 9 months lasted about 4 years with the underwent winter nymphal quiescence from December to February. The extended emergence and oviposition were registered from the end of July to September. The structure of the K. exilis population is complex; it is represented by 3 cohorts, the sizes of which were overlapped due to the extended flight period and recruitment of the population with nymphs of a new generation in the spring of the next year. Stoneflies K exilis grow fast in warm time, when S. compacta and S. manchuricus just appeared in the stream, or interrupted their growth at relatively high water temperatures in summer. The annual production of three species varied from 0.045 to 0.383 g DM/m(2), P/B-annual was 1.1-6.9; P/B-cohort = 6.2-9.1, and P/B-year = 4.1-9.4. The low values of P/B-annual and P/B-year were found in semivoltine K exilis, and high ones - in univoltine S. compacta. The latter had the higher cohort specific growth rate; its specific production was 0.026 day(-)1. In the K exilis population, the cohort specific growth rate (0.013 day(-1)) and specific production (0.004 day(-1)) were characterized by the low values. The highest production was observed in the S. manchuricus population, where nymphs grew with the specific rate of 0.023 day(-1), and their average density reached 59 ind./m(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0044-5134			WOS:000352248000005

Climate, invasive species and land use drive population dynamics of a cold-water specialist								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				54	2			638	647		10.1111/1365-2664.12766				APR 2017	2017	1. Climate change is an additional stressor in a complex suite of threats facing freshwater biodiversity, particularly for cold-water fishes. Research addressing the consequences of climate change on cold-water fish has generally focused on temperature limits defining spatial distributions, largely ignoring how climatic variation influences population dynamics in the context of other existing stressors.2. We used long-term data from 92 populations of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus - one of North America's most cold-adapted fishes - to quantify additive and interactive effects of climate, invasive species and land use on population dynamics (abundance, variability and growth rate).3. Populations were generally depressed, more variable and declining where spawning and rearing stream habitat was limited, invasive species and land use were prevalent and stream temperatures were highest. Increasing stream temperature acted additively and independently, whereas land use and invasive species had additive and interactive effects (i.e. the impact of one stressor depended on exposure to the other stressor).4. Most (58%-78%) of the explained variation in population dynamics was attributed to the presence of invasive species, differences in life history and management actions in foraging habitats in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Although invasive fishes had strong negative effects on populations in foraging habitats, proactive control programmes appeared to effectively temper their negative impact.5. Synthesis and applications. Long-term demographic data emphasize that climate warming will exacerbate imperilment of cold-water specialists like bull trout, yet other stressors - especially invasive fishes - are immediate threats that can be addressed by proactive management actions. Therefore, climate-adaptation strategies for freshwater biodiversity should consider existing abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which provide potential and realized opportunity for conservation of freshwater biodiversity in a warming world.									16	0	0	0	12	1	16			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000397930300031		
J	Desclaux, C; de Montaudouin, X; Bachelet, G								Cockle Cerastoderma edule population mortality: role of the digenean parasite Himasthla quissetensis								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				279				141	150		10.3354/meps279141				2004	2004	Infection patterns of the digenean trematode Himasthla quissetensis in its second intermediate host, the edible cockle Cerastoderma edule, and the impact of this parasite on cockle populations were quantified. A 2 yr transplant experiment and a 4 yr survey were conducted in Arcachon Bay, a coastal lagoon on the Atlantic SW coast of France. Cockles free of H. quissetensis were transplanted at La Canelette, a station where cockles were usually highly infected. Infection began in May, when the water temperature reached 17degreesC and stopped in November (12degreesC). There was no new infection between November and April. Monthly surveys at 2 stations, Arguin and La Canelette, confirmed that cockle infection by H. quissetensis occurred during the warmer period of the year. Only cockles with a shell length > 8 mm became infected; therefore, cockle growth rate, which differed at the 2 stations, was also a key factor explaining infection phenology. In winter, the mean parasite abundance of H quissetensis in cockles decreased at both stations. The mortality rate of parasites in cockles was very low, with no seasonal pattern, and did not explain this winter decrease. Consequently, the decrease of H. quissetensis was interpreted as mortality of heavily infected cockles. At Arguin, where the cockle population was characterised by moderate abundance, high growth rate and short lifespan, cockle mortality amounted to 93% during the first year of benthic life, with no significant contribution of parasites; in the following year (Year 2), cockle mortality was 85%, with 28% due to H. quissetensis infection. At La Canelette, the cockle population, characterised by low abundance and low growth rate, suffered almost 100% mortality in the first year, with no contribution by parasites, which started to infect cockles in the second year only; the remaining cockles had a long lifespan (up to 5 yr), and > 46% of their mortality was linked to H. quissetensis infection. It is concluded that both host growth rate and water temperature are important factors in the initiation of parasite infection and that the intensity of infection and its effect on host mortality closely depend on host growth and environmental factors.									55	0	0	0	53	1	55			0171-8630			WOS:000224800400015

They are the basis for many comprehensive studies in pest management, pesticide resistance, predator-prey relationships, biological control, mass-rearing and harvesting of insects, plant resistance, etc. Because the morphology, physiology, survival, fecundity, and predation/consumption rate of most arthropods will vary significantly depending on their developmental stage and sex, precise description of stage differentiation and inclusion of both sexes are critical for attaining realistic and accurate life table analyses and correctly evaluating the overall fitness of populations. Since traditional female age-specific life tables ignore the male individuals in a population and are incapable of describing the unique and important feature of stage differentiation (i.e., metamorphosis) that is a defining characteristic of insects and mites, their application to data analysis involving these groups will inevitably result in miscalculations and limit the practical application of these life tables. On the other hand, the age-stage, two-sex life table (hereafter referred to as the two-sex life table whenever appropriate), can precisely delineate stage differentiation and includes both sexes in data analysis, description, and interpretation, and in practical applications. In this review, the problems of female age-specific life tables are examined, followed by a discussion of the advantages of using the two-sex life table. Finally, applications of the two-sex life table in various types of entomological research are discussed and accompanied by examples.									10	1	0	0	5	0	11			0171-8177	2363-7102		WOS:000531551400001

Determining the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems requires understanding the direct effects on all trophic levels as well as indirect effects mediated by trophic coupling. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate change on the pelagic food web in the Celtic Sea, a productive shelf region in the Northeast Atlantic. Using long-term data, we examined possible direct and indirect 'bottom-up' climate effects across four trophic levels: phytoplankton, zooplankton, mid-trophic level fish and seabirds. During the period 1986-2007, although there was no temporal trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the decadal mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Celtic Sea increased by 0.66 +/- 0.02 degrees C. Despite this, there was only a weak signal of climate change in the Celtic Sea food web. Changes in plankton community structure were found, however this was not related to SST or NAO. A negative relationship occurred between herring abundance (0- and 1-group) and spring SST ( 0- group: p = 0.02, slope = -0.30560.125; 1-group: p = 0.04, slope = -0.410 +/- 0.193). Seabird demographics showed complex species-specific responses. There was evidence of direct effects of spring NAO ( on black-legged kittiwake population growth rate: p = 0.03, slope = 0.0314 +/- 0.014) as well as indirect bottom- up effects of lagged spring SST (on razorbill breeding success: p = 0.01, slope = -0.144 +/- 0.05). Negative relationships between breeding success and population growth rate of razorbills and common guillemots may be explained by interactions between mid-trophic level fish. Our findings show that the impacts of climate change on the Celtic Sea ecosystem is not as marked as in nearby regions (e.g. the North Sea), emphasizing the need for more research at regional scales.									16	0	0	0	15	0	18			1932-6203			WOS:000310135800044	23091621

Yet, data limitations often restrict our ability to interpret the numerical response of species to habitat alteration and climatic change adds to this challenge. In this study, we used habitat-specific demographic information from an individually-marked population of Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and a forest timber supply model to project population trends over an 80-year horizon. We modelled changes in Ovenbird abundance, productivity, and population growth rate as a function of harvesting scenarios (no harvest, forestry-as-usual, and increased [10% or 20%] harvesting intensity) and projected impacts of climate change (0%, 10%, and 50% reductions in population size over the 80-year period), as well as contrasting assumptions about population dynamics (i.e. open vs. closed population). Among the many effects of climate change, it has been hypothesized that reductions in annual snow cover will occur, causing deeper and more frequent frost penetration into the soil and, in turn, a reduction in invertebrate (food) abundance during the following breeding season. Our models suggest that the study area currently is a demographic sink (lambda = 0.920) for Ovenbirds, although some habitat types still act as demographic sources. Over the first 7 years, a large decline in abundance of territorial males (similar to 25%) is projected, unless population levels are maintained through immigration. Interestingly, when we allowed for immigration from outside the study area, population growth rate remained <1 because a larger proportion of the population occupied habitat types acting as sinks. Over an 80-year period, the climate change scenarios we simulated were more likely to have negative impacts (5-49%) than forestry activities, whether we applied the current management plan or more intensive harvesting scenarios. To our knowledge, this study used some of the most detailed habitat-specific demographic information available for a North American forest songbird to model the relative influence of land use, climate, and population dynamics on population trends. Future studies should examine the possibility of synergistic effects between harvesting and climate change, to model their influence on Ovenbird or other species foraging on litter invertebrates.

J	Taga, Makoto; Kamimura, Yasuhiro; Yamashita, Yoh								Effects of water temperature and prey density on recent growth of chub mackerel Scomber japonicus larvae and juveniles along the Pacific coast of Boso-Kashimanada								FISHERIES SCIENCE				85	6			931	942		10.1007/s12562-019-01354-8				NOV 2019	2019	The effects of temperature and prey density on the recent growth rate (RGR) of chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, were examined. Scomber spp. larvae and juveniles were collected along the Boso-Kashimanada Pacific coast in Japan between March and July in 2015 and 2016. Larvae and juveniles identified as S. japonicus using DNA were subjected to stomach-content and otolith-increment analyses. The effects of temperature and prey density on RGR were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), which showed that temperature positively affected the RGR of larvae in the body length (BL) classes<5 mm, 5-7 mm, 7-9 mm and 9-11 mm. Prey density also affected growth in the<5 mm, 5-7 mm, 7-9 mm and>11 mm classes and effects of prey density on RGR for larger (>11 mm) larvae and juveniles were stronger than those for smaller (<9 mm) larvae. S. japonicus larvae transform into juveniles at around 12 mm BL, and the increased feed demands of juveniles likely lead to prey-density-dependent growth. The otolith increment widths of larvae and juveniles were significantly narrower than those during the same stages in 1-year-old S. japonicus collected from purse seine fisheries operated in the Joban or Kashimanada areas, suggesting growth-dependent mortality.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0919-9268	1444-2906		WOS:000496954700006

Here, we present the case of Thalassiosira curviseriata, a winter-blooming diatom in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina, which displayed a noticeable decrease in the past decade along with conspicuous changes in phenology. We compiled interannual field data to assess compound effects of environmental variations and grazing by the invasive copepod Eurytemora americana. The two species displayed opposite trends over the period examined. The diatom decreased toward the last years, mainly during the winters, and remained relatively constant over the other seasons, while the copepod increased toward the last years, with an occurrence restricted to winter and early spring. A quantitative assessment by structural equation modeling unveiled that the observed long-term trend of T. curviseriata resulted from the synergistic effects of environmental changes driven by water temperature, salinity, and grazing. These results suggest that the shift in the abundance distribution of T. curviseriata toward higher annual ranges of temperature and salinity-as displayed by habitat association curves-constitutes a functional response to avoid seasonal overlapping with its predator in late winters. The observed changes in the timing and abundance of the blooming species resulted in conspicuous shifts in primary production pulses. Our results provide insights on mechanistic processes shaping the phenology and structure of phytoplankton blooms.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000391456600007

We used time series of nestling growth rates and estimated the seasonal timing of peak biomass of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus (Kroyer, 1848) using a temperature-dependent phenology equation. We developed a single model to examine intercolony differences in the effect of the timing of regional peak prey biomass on seabird nestling growth rates. This model indicated nestling growth rates on Triangle Island varied widely and were positively associated with timing of peak zooplankton biomass, such that higher growth rates were observed when the peak biomass occurred later in the breeding season. In contrast, nestling growth rates were consistently high at Frederick Island, where peak copepod biomass always occurred relatively late. If ocean climate warming results in a poleward shift of Neocalanus abundance and induces earlier and more narrow timing of availability, then episodes of poor nestling growth will increase in frequency on Triangle Island and could eventually affect auklets on more northerly colonies.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000398092400003

Water temperature, partial fullness index (I-P) and gonado-somatic index (I-G) explained between 31 and 52% of the monthly variability in growth. Temperature and IP of capelin Mallotus villosus had significant effects on growth of all age groups and explained most of the variance for ages 6-8 and 4-5 years, respectively. The I-P of large invertebrates (ages 4 to 7 years), samllance (Ammodytes sp. age 6 years) and demersal fishes (age 9 years) had age-specific effects in the model. Overall, amphipods, decapods and echinoderms dominated the Atlantic cod diet in most seasons, but fish consumption by Atlantic cod was high in June and July, particularly on capelin. The rapid increase in somatic mass during June and July occurred despite cold water temperatures ( < 3 degrees C at 50 m) and moderate to high gonado-somatic index. The findings of this study suggest that when food was not a limiting factor, growth tended to increase even when Atlantic cod occupied colder waters, but when food was limiting, the opposite may have occured.

We explored the effects of increased flooding on the Geoffroy's cat, Leopardus geoffroyi (d'Orbigny and Gervais, 1844), and pampas fox, Pseudalopex gymnocercus (G. Fischer, 1814), exposed to in abnormally rainy period in marshes at Mar Chiquita, Argentina. In particular, we assessed the effects of flooding oil (i) habitat use by L. geoffroyi and P. gymnocercus, (ii) abundance of their main prey, and (iii) functional responses of predators to variations in prey abundance. Overall, simple regression analysis identified negative effects of flooding oil abundance of prey (rodents, waterbirds, and arthropods), but structural-equation modeling and logistic generalized linear models identified differential effects of rainfall on habitat use by and functional responses of predators, respectively. Habitat use by L. geoffroyi was more negatively affected by interannual variability in flooding-induced habitat loss, particularly through its effect on waterbirds. At the same time, habitat use by P. gymnocercus was less affected, likely because this species was less dependent on prey from flooded areas and used higher elevation habitats. Given that most native grasslands in elevated areas have been converted to agriculture, the more specialized L. geoffroyi faces a greater threat if current trends of climate change persist in this region.									14	1	0	0	16	2	17			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000256626600010

Effects of food supplies and water temperature on growth rates of two species of freshwater tropical shrimps								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				60	8			1514	1524		10.1111/fwb.12584				AUG 2015	2015	1. Growth rates of individual freshwater shrimp of the species Atya lanipes and Xiphocaris elongata were measured in a second-order stream in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico over 10 years (1997-2007). Shrimp living at lower altitudes in warmer water and wider stream channels with more algal and detrital foods were predicted to grow and reproduce more rapidly.2. Shrimp were marked and recaptured periodically in pools located at three altitudes to determine whether temperature affected growth rates among individual A. lanipes and X. elongata.3. Mean annual water temperatures ranged from 20 to 24 degrees C with the uppermost pool being cooler than the lower pools. Mean annual growth rates for Atya and Xiphocaris were 0.27 and 0.1 mm carapace length, respectively, for all three populations.4. Differences in growth were partially influenced by how each species obtains its food. Atya is a filter feeder and scraper and has continuous access to suspended organic particles and biofilms. The slower growth rate for Xiphocaris elongata is most likely a result of the wider range in quality and accessibility of food resources.5. Differences in pool morphology and depths probably affected differences in food availability. Increased leaf litter retention in the deeper upper and lower pools probably increased shrimp growth rates, while washout of leaf litter from the relatively shallow, elongate mid-altitude pool decreased Atya lanipes growth rates.6. These long-lived, slow-growing shrimp species transform a wide range of organic materials into their biomass. Because of the slow growth rates of these detritivores shrimp, tropical storms, hurricanes, droughts or other disturbances could have persistent, long-term impacts on detrital processing and on the populations of their predators.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000358017100004

Although evidence varied between locations, Arctic char generally utilized ambient water temperatures available in the upper water column, possibly in aid of physiological processes such as digestion, whereas deeper waters were suggested to be used for feeding purposes. Size-dependent thermal preferences were evident, with larger individuals utilizing cooler water temperatures (8.5 degrees C) compared with smaller individuals (9.5 degrees C), a pattern suggestive of ontogenetic changes in thermal habitat use for the purposes of growth maximization. Diurnal patterns of diving activity were interpreted to reflect the vertical migration of prey items and (or) the visual capabilities of Arctic char. Dive duration was dependent on body size and external body temperature with smaller individuals performing shorter dives in colder water temperatures (<1 min at 5 degrees C) than larger fish (similar to 2 min at 5 degrees C), likely to maintain their core temperature and abilities to both effectively capture prey and avoid predation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000529378700009

Autumnal feeding activity of R. rutilus first showed a striking shift from day to twilight when water temperature fell from 20 to 10 degrees C, and a low but steady night activity prevailed in late autumn, when temperature had fallen to 5 degrees C and the length of the night had increased. The size of the captured littoral R. rutilus also increased throughout the autumn. Both shifts may be linked to increasing daytime predation risk and decreasing food demand and availability.

Enemy release promotes range expansion in a host plant								OECOLOGIA				172	4			1203	1212		10.1007/s00442-012-2555-x				AUG 2013	2013	Climate is considered to be the predominant driver shaping species distributions at macroecological scales, yet the importance of incorporating biotic interactions in predicting future range margins under climate change scenarios is increasingly being recognised. We used translocation studies to investigate how survival and growth patterns of an understory shrub planted at latitudes within its range, at its range limit and beyond its polewards boundary (in areas it may colonise as a result of shifting climate envelopes) are affected by the presence of a primary herbivore. Specifically, we tested the null hypotheses that: (1) biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in limiting survival and growth rates across the limits of a host plant's latitudinal range, and (2) at smaller spatial scales biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in determining survival and growth rates at edge versus interior position within a forest fragment. We found that the understory shrub Macropiper excelsum is able to survive polewards of its current latitudinal limit within the first year after transplant; in fact, growth is higher outside the plant's current natural range than within its present-day distribution. This trend is particularly pronounced in forest core environments and corresponds closely to patterns of reduced herbivory outside the plant's range. The absence of the primary herbivore, Cleora scriptaria, and concomitant reduction in the suppressive effects of herbivory outside of the plant's range appear to be supporting enhanced growth and survival. If host plants are able to successfully track their climatic niche and disperse into novel areas prior to the arrival of their natural predators, it is possible that 'enemy release' may facilitate the establishment of plant species. These findings highlight the importance of considering biotic interactions alongside abiotic variables when predicting future species' ranges under climate change.									13	1	0	0	12	0	13			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000322180000027	23239216

We examined over 9,700 smallmouth bass stomachs from April through August during 1996 and 1997. Juvenile salmonids were not a major component of smallmouth bass diets by weight and number at any location in either 1996 or 1997. Of the approximately 8,600 stomach samples containing food items, only 67 had juvenile salmonid remains. Juvenile salmonids accounted for approximately 11% of smallmouth bass diets by weight in the forebay in 1996 and 5% in the Snake and Clearwater river arms in 1997, with smaller proportions at other locations. Crustaceans and nonsalmonid fishes were the dominant prey items by weight at all locations in 1996 and 1997 except for the Snake River arm in 1996, where macroinvertebrates were dominant. Monthly consumption rates (smolts/bass/d) of juvenile salmonids by smallmouth bass were highest in the forebay (0.02) in April 1996 and in the restricted zone of the forebay (0.05) in July 1997. We estimated that approximately 17,500 (1996: 6,728; 1997: 10,809) juvenile salmonids were consumed by smallmouth bass from April through August in 1996 and 1997. High flows and resulting lower water temperatures and higher turbidity in the Lower Granite Reservoir during our study probably affected salmonid predation rates by smallmouth bass. Management efforts directed at enhancing migratory conditions for juvenile salmonids (e.g., higher flows, lower water temperatures, and higher turbidity) will probably also reduce predation from smallmouth bass.									19	0	0	0	19	0	20			0275-5947			WOS:000222067500018

Growth was especially reduced in larger and more deep-bodied fish groups, providing evidence that this is due to increased hydrodynamic stress, induced by ship and wind waves, in the shallow habitats compared to the deep habitat. Other factors such as water temperature and food availability seemed to be of minor importance for the observed growth differences. Gillnet catches at the experimental site and an adjacent site showed that most juvenile cyprinids, including the species from the enclosure study, bream Abramis brama and dace Leuciscus leuciscus, nonetheless prefer shallow habitats compared to deeper sublittoral habitats. Juvenile cyprinids in Lake Constance may prefer these shallow habitats as refuges against larger piscivorous predators, mainly perch Perca fluviatilis, despite the cost in terms of reduced somatic growth indicating that juvenile cyprinids first of all optimize survival rate instead of somatic growth rate.

J	Dickey, Marie-Helene; Gauthier, Gilles; Cadieux, Marie-Christine								Climatic effects on the breeding phenology and reproductive success of an arctic-nesting goose species								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				14	9			1973	1985		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01622.x				SEP 2008	2008	Climate warming is pronounced in the Arctic and migratory birds are expected to be among the most affected species. We examined the effects of local and regional climatic variations on the breeding phenology and reproductive success of greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica), a migratory species nesting in the Canadian Arctic. We used a long-term dataset based on the monitoring of 5447 nests and the measurements of 19 234 goslings over 16 years (1989-2004) on Bylot Island. About 50% of variation in the reproductive phenology of individuals was explained by spring climatic factors. High mean temperatures and, to a lesser extent, low snow cover in spring were associated with an increase in nest density and early egg-laying and hatching dates. High temperature in spring and high early summer rainfall were positively related to nesting success. These effects may result from a reduction in egg predation rate when the density of nesting geese is high and when increased water availability allows females to stay close to their nest during incubation recesses. Summer brood loss and production of young at the end of the summer increased when values of the summer Arctic Oscillation (AO) index were either very positive (low temperatures) or very negative (high temperatures), indicating that these components of the breeding success were most influenced by the regional summer climate. Gosling mass and size near fledging were reduced in years with high spring temperatures. This effect is likely due to a reduced availability of high quality food in years with early spring, either due to food depletion resulting from high brood density or a mismatch between hatching date of goslings and the timing of the peak of plant quality. Our analysis suggests that climate warming should advance the reproductive phenology of geese, but that high spring temperatures and extreme values of the summer AO index may decrease their reproductive success up to fledging.									104	2	0	0	103	1	109			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000258257700002		
J	Lowe, CG								Bioenergetics of free-ranging juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, HI								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				278	2			141	156	PII S0022-0981(02)00331-3	10.1016/S0022-0981(02)00331-3				OCT 30 2002	2002	Metabolic and activity rates determined from free-ranging juvenile scalloped hammerhead shark pups (Sphyrna lewini) in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, HI, were used to develop a simplified energy budget for this population. Five shark pups were tracked using a specially designed acoustic tail beat transmitter. Previous laboratory experiments determined that tail beat frequency (TBF) and water temperature could be used as predictors of instantaneous swimming speed (0 and oxygen consumption rates (Vo(2)). Sharks carrying transmitters had higher cost of transport than uninstrumented sharks, but because the difference was quantifiable, appropriate corrections could be made for transmitter effects on energy consumption of instrumented sharks. Sharks tracked in Kane'ohe Bay had an overall average TBF of 70 +/- 10 beats min (-1) and a U of 0.81 +/- 0.1 body lengths s (-1), but swam significantly faster at night than during the day. These sharks also exhibited high average metabolic rates (MR) (96 +/- 15 U kg (-1) day (-1)) compared with other species of sharks previously studied. Sharks tracked during warmer summer months swam slightly faster and exhibited higher MR than one tracked in December. The high MR measured for sharks in the bay indicate that these sharks require a high daily ration. The relatively low caloric value of the most common prey (snapping shrimp, Alpheus malabaricus) suggests that high numbers must be consumed to meet the sharks' daily requirements. Low and/or negative growth rates of shark pups in the field and declining population size over the summer season suggests that a significant percentage of pups in Kane'ohe Bay may starve as the result of their high MR requirements. Although availability of A. malabaricus may not be limiting in Kane'ohe Bay, foraging skills of some neonates may be inadequate to enable them to meet their daily energetic needs. However, sharks that are successful in surviving through the winter may actually grow faster in the colder months due to the temperature dependent decrease of their MR and a reduction in conspecific competition as the result of high summer seasonal attrition due to starvation and emigration.

Three successive caging experiments (14-16 d each) were conducted with flounder (initial size = 25-35 mm total length) in June and July 2003 in shallow water habitats (<1 m) of Spar Island, Common Fence Point, and Hog Island; the first two sites were located in Mount Hope Bay, and the latter in Narragansett Bay. The average growth rate of flounder ranged between 0.51 and 0.95 mm d(-1) and was inversely related with increased incidences of hypoxic conditions (i.e., amount of time dissolved oxygen was <= 4.0 mg L-1). RNA:DNA, a surrogate measure of growth and feeding condition, corroborated somatic growth trends, and therefore exhibited similar spatio-temporal variability. In contrast to somatic growth, however, water temperature was the most important factor affecting flounder condition, such that RNA:DNA was inversely related to the amount of time water temperature was >20 degrees C. Benthic core samples indicated that food availability was greatest at Spar Island and was attributable to the numerical dominance of Crepidula fornicata Linnaeus (slipper limpet) during the early summer. Moreover, stomach contents of flounder reflected differences in prey species composition, whereby individuals from Spar Island consumed a higher percentage of molluscs relative to them other sites, where the preferred prey items were harpacticoid copepods and small decapods (primarily brachyuran crabs). Despite the observed discrepancies in feeding habits across sites, the extent of stomach fullness for flounder did not vary spatially (mean fullness = 44-49% across sites). It is concluded that the somatic growth, RNA:DNA, and feeding behavior of juvenile flounder in Mount Hope Bay and Narragansett Bay varies significantly across small spatio-temporal scales in response to changes in dissolved oxygen and thermal conditions.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1092-6194			WOS:000254967000004

The biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter has revealed that bottom trawling had an effect on the trophic state of Thermaikos Gulf. Changes on the benthic microbial food web were also recorded, during the three sampling seasons. Even though trawling-induced sediment resuspension did not alter significantly the abundance of the microbial components, with the exception of the most impacted station, it determined changes regarding their relative importance. Thus, the ratios of bacterium to nanoflagellates and ciliate to nanoflagellates abundance increased in the trawled stations, causing a sudden increase in bacterial C production, in comparison to the non-trawled station. Four months later, the effects of trawling on the microbial food web were less evident, masked possibly by the drastic decrease in the water temperature. The results of the present work suggest that bottom trawling induces alteration of the sedimentological variables and can be considered as a factor affecting the function of the microbial food web in marine coastal ecosystems. These alterations cause faster mobilisation of organic C buried in the sediment and increase nutrient concentrations and availability in the system, thus inducing an effect that could lead to coastal eutrophication.

We demonstrated that interspecific competition with the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) significantly increases the daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. The effect of intraspecific competition on the daytime activity of salmon was half that of interspecific competition. This indicates that the effect of rainbow trout was a combination of increasing density and the identity of the competitor. We also demonstrated that the effect of rainbow trout was probably the result of territorial interference between species. Moreover, we showed that water temperature simultaneously played an important role in explaining daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. During twilight, we observed no effect of competition on salmon activity, but environmental cues other than temperature (e.g., invertebrate drift, cloud cover) became significant predictors of activity. Feeding and growth rates of Atlantic salmon were not affected by the different levels of competition. Nevertheless, the exotic species may have a major impact by exposing the native species to increased risks of daytime predation.									17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000259193900004

Plankton samples were collected at intervals of 4 h over several 24-h periods from February 1995 to January 1996. Sagitta friderici occurred throughout the year. Abundance of S. friderici showed considerable diel and monthly variations, ranging from 2 to 373 ind. m(-3). During the low-salinity period of February and March, higher abundance was found when salinity was higher, but from May to January abundance did not show consistent pattern in relation to time of day and tidal cycle. Seasonal variation in total body length was related to temperature variations. Mean biomass ranged from 10.593 to 57.533 mgDW m(-3). The daily production rate of S. friderici ranged from 0.009 to 4.488 mgC m(-3) d(-1). Sagitta friderici preyed mainly upon copepods (63.2%) such as Acartia (8.3%), Oncaea (7.4%) and Corycaeus (6.7%), among other prey. The daily mean feeding rate was 1.33 prey d(-1) and it was related to the water temperature.									5	1	0	0	5	2	6			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000188455700009

With increasing temperatures, the amount of warmer, surface water thermal habitats (16-27 degrees C) has increased while there has been a reciprocal decline in cooler water habitats (5-15 degrees C). These cooler water habitats are the most abundant and comprise the core habitats of the ecosystem. The coldest thermal habitats (1-4 degrees C), however, have increased slightly in amount or have remained constant, reflecting a discontinuity in the progression of warming along a latitudinal gradient. This discontinuity may be the result of recent changes in the circulation of water masses in the northern Gulf of Maine, potentially associated with the Labrador Current. The contraction of core thermal habitats appears to have had biological consequences on multiple trophic levels. In particular, two zooplankton species associated with the larval feeding of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, have declined in abundance in the same areas where cod populations have exhibited continually poor recruitment. The zooplankton species group Pseudocalanus spp., which is associated with winter-spawning cod, has declined on Georges Bank and in the Eastern Gulf of Maine. The zooplankton Centro-pages typicus has declined in the Gulf of Maine during late summer into fall, potentially affecting spring-spawning cod in that area. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that portions of the population complex of cod have lower reproductive output due to changes in zooplankton abundance, which we associate with the distribution of temperatures within the ecosystem.

Contamination and global warming are two key anthropogenic stressors, yet their effects on body stoichiometry have been rarely tested. Further, while thermal evolution may increase the ability to deal with warming, it is unknown how thermal evolution modifies the effect of contaminants under warming. Using resurrection ecology, we studied two Daphnia magna subpopulations (old/recent) of which the recent subpopulation evolved a higher heat tolerance. We exposed both subpopulations to a sublethal concentration of nano zinc oxide (nZnO) and 4 degrees C warming and quantified their effects on body stoichiometry: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) contents and their ratios (C:N, C:P, N:P). In the old subpopulation, nZnO only marginally decreased the C content and had no effect on N and P contents and their ratios. In contrast, in the recent subpopulation nZnO strongly increased the body P content ( + 51%) and reduced the C:P ( - 34%) and N:P ( - 34%) ratios at 24 degrees C but not at 20 degrees C. Moreover, these stoichiometric changes were not explained by changes of corresponding macromolecules as assumed by theory. Our results indicate that the stoichiometric responses to nZnO in Daphnia are temperature-dependent and modified by rapid evolution. The observed changes in body stoichiometry may affect the food quality of this important prey and have the potential to cascade through food webs and shape nutrients cycling.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0166-445X	1879-1514		WOS:000445168900010	30007158

We investigated the effects of environmental factors on the respiration and feeding rates of polyps of Aurelia aurita s. l. under controlled laboratory conditions in order to construct an empirical energy budget model for application to natural polyp populations. The carbon weight-specific respiration rate of polyps increased exponentially with increasing temperature from 8 to 28 degrees C and was constant at salinities ranging from 15 to 33. The general functional response of polyps feeding on various zooplankton taxa was expressed by a linear increase in ingestion rate as a function of prey density, although it was affected by the size and/or swimming ability of prey organisms. Accordingly, the clearance rate was constant irrespective of prey density at a given temperature. The rate increased linearly with temperature from 8 to 26 degrees C. Integrating these results, we constructed a carbon budget model of A. aurita polyps as a function of temperature and mesozooplankton prey density. An application of this model to polyps in Fukuyama Harbor, the Inland Sea of Japan, suggested that they consistently attain a positive growth (somata and offspring) rate, ranging from 0.0039 to 0.34 mu g C mu g C-1 d(-1). Our model allows estimation of the potential growth rates of polyps in temperate coastal waters where temperature and mesozooplankton biomass data are available, contributing to comprehensive understanding of polyp population dynamics in nature.									5	1	0	0	5	0	6			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000398911600007

On the basis of predicted changes to air pressure and an empirical relationship between wind-driven upwelling and zooplankton biomass, we calculate that production of food for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) may decrease by 5-9%. We developed empirical relationships between sea surface temperature, zooplankton biomass, adult recruitment, and terminal ocean weight for the early Stuart stock of Fraser River sockeye salmon. Our analyses show that warmer sea surface temperatures, larger adult recruitment, and lower zooplankton biomass are correlated with smaller adult sockeye. Bioenergetics modeling suggests that higher metabolic costs in warmer water coupled with lower food availability could cause the observed reductions in size. Warmer sea surface temperatures during coastal migration by juveniles were correlated with lower recruitment 2 yr later. Warmer sea surface temperatures may be a surrogate for increased levels of predation or decreased food during the juvenile stage. We speculate that Fraser sockeye will be less abundant and smaller if the climate changes as suggested by the Canadian Climate Centre's general circulation model.									50	1	0	0	45	0	52			0706-652X			WOS:A1995UA09600012

The locomotor performance of ectotherms is known to be strongly affected by temperature. However, how differences in water temperature may drive the evolution of alternative foraging tactics in amphibious animals remains poorly understood. Fish-eating Viperine snakes Natrix maura occur from high altitude cold water streams to warm shallow lakes, and employ two main feeding strategies: sentinel foraging (underwater sit-and-wait behaviour) and active foraging (fish chasing). Using 272 juvenile snakes we measured: the performance kinetics of diving and swimming in a wide range of water temperatures; basal metabolic levels in relation to body temperature; and the type of foraging mode expressed in water-temperature-acclimated snakes. Individual swimming performances increased with testing temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 degrees C). Apnoea time followed an opposite trend however, plausibly reflecting the fact that oxygen demands are related to the metabolic rate of ectotherms. That is, snake heart rates increased with body temperature. Snakes acclimated to 10 degrees C water mostly displayed sentinel foraging. By contrast, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C water-acclimated snakes were extremely active fish chasers. Individual apnoea times at the various testing temperatures were all correlated; as were individual swimming speeds. There was however no clear relationship between an individual's ability to hold its breath and its ability to swim, suggesting that both performance traits may be the target of different selective pressures. Fast swimming speed and long breath holding abilities are likely key determinants of both foraging success and predatory evasion, although in a context dependent manner. Active swimming foraging is likely to be advantageous in warm water (>20 degrees C), while sentinel foraging appears better suited to cold water (<14 degrees C). The physiological aspects of foraging tactics of amphibious snakes combined with field and laboratory observations support the idea that physiological and environmental constraints may generate shifts in habitat use and associated foraging tactics in amphibious ectotherms. Avenues for further research are discussed.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 411-422.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000353508000013

Acidification alters predator-prey interactions of blue crab Callinectes sapidus and soft-shell clam Mya arenaria								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				489				58	65		10.1016/j.jembe.2016.11.010				APR 2017	2017	Acidification due to anthropogenic CO2 pollution, along with episodic or persistent acidification that occurs in coastal environments, will likely result in severe seasonal acidification in estuarine environments. Acidification decreases the fitness of individual species, but the degree to which predator-prey interactions will be impacted is largely unknown. This mesocosm study examined the effect of CO2 acidification on crab-bivalve predator prey interactions involving two commercially important Chesapeake Bay species, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus and the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria. In particular, the direct effects of CO2 acidification on clam growth and behavior, and the indirect effects of CO2 acidification on interactions between crabs and clams were examined. Mya arenaria were grown in CO2-acidified water (pH 7.2) or ambient conditions (pH 7.8) for 30 days. To determine the effect of acidification on clam responsiveness to mechanical disturbance, a probe was slowly moved towards clams until they ceased pumping (a behavior to avoid detection by predators), and the distance between the probe and the clam's siphon was noted. Clams were exposed to predation by C sapidus, which were held under acidified or ambient conditions for 48 h. Callinectes sapidus handling time, search time, and encounter rate were measured from video. Acidified clams had lighter shells than ambient clams, indicating that shell dissolution occurred. Acidification reduced the responsiveness of M. arenaria to a mechanical disturbance that simulated an approaching predator. As compared to ambient trials, crabs in acidified trials had higher encounter rates; however, this was offset by crabs taking longer to find the first clam in trials, and by increased occurrence of crabs eating only a portion of the prey available. As a result, there was no net change in predation-related clam mortality in acidified trials as compared to ambient conditions. Understanding how acidification will impact food webs in productive estuarine environments requires an examination of the direct impacts of acidification on organism behavior and physiology, as well as indirect effects of acidification mediated through predator-prey interactions.

J	Turney, Shaun; Buddle, Chris M.								Body size mediates the relationship between spider (Arachnida: Araneae) assemblage composition and prey consumption rate: results of a mesocosm experiment in the Yukon, Canada								OECOLOGIA				189	3			757	768		10.1007/s00442-019-04346-8				MAR 2019	2019	Many ecological assemblages are undergoing rapid changes in composition and diversity, and changes at one trophic level can have direct and cascading effects on other trophic levels. Prey consumption typically increases with predator diversity due to niche complementarity and sampling effects. However, the effect of functional traits and interactions between predator species mean that the relationship is far from simple. In July 2016, we performed a series of experiments in the Yukon, Canada, to investigate the relationship between spider assemblage composition and prey consumption, with a focus on the wolf spider Pardosa lapponica (Thorell 1872). We carried out feeding trials, in which P. lapponica and other spider species were offered potential prey, as well as mesocosm experiments, in which we varied spider assemblage composition within small enclosures. We confirmed that P. lapponica is a generalist consumer, individual consumption rate increased with spider body size, and that intraguild predation is present. We found that prey consumption was greatest in the least diverse assemblage but consumption did increase with predator functional trait variation and biomass. The best model of prey consumption included predator assemblage composition, variation in body mass, biomass, and all interactions. The body size of a spider affects its trophic niche, energy requirements, and its interactions with other spiders. As a result, body size mediates the relationship between spider assemblage composition and prey consumption. A deeper understanding of the relationships between traits and functions will allow us to better predict the effect of species loss or gain on ecosystem functions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000461360700017	30725372	
J	Foy, RJ; Paul, AJ								Winter feeding and changes in somatic energy content of age-0 Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				128	6			1193	1200		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<1193:WFACIS>2.0.CO;2				NOV 1999	1999	During the winter of 1996-1997, somatic energy content and diets of age-0 Pacific herring Clupea pallasi from Prince William Sound, Alaska, were examined. From October to March, the standard length of age-0 recruits continued to increase, indicating either growth or mortality of smaller fish. The whole-body energy content averaged 4.4 kJ/g wet weight for fish captured in October and increased to 5.0 kJ/g wet weight in November. Thereafter, somatic energy continually declined, reaching 3.9 kJ/g wet weight in March. The December-March decline in nutritional status of the recruits verified that the energy derived from feeding was not enough to meet metabolic needs. The energy density of taxa found in the diets remained steady through the winter and increased in March. Total zooplankton biomass, however, decreased as the mean water temperature decreased. Estimated assimilation rates were lower for smaller fish than larger fish and decreased as winter progressed. We concluded that juvenile herring rely on energy stores to overwinter and that smaller fish are more likely to be affected by starvation. Also, the duration of overwinter starvation may be related more to photoperiod than to mean water temperature.									48	1	0	0	42	0	54			0002-8487			WOS:000089184000014

In this study, we show that coral-dwelling damselfishes associated with bleached and dead coral hosts are more susceptible to predation compared with fishes associated with healthy coral colonies. Although the predator (Pseudochromis fuscus) actively avoided both bleached and recently dead corals, they were almost twice as likely to strike at prey associated with the stark white colonies of bleached corals. These results suggest that coral-dwelling fishes are much more conspicuous against the bleached-white background, increasing their susceptibility to predation. Direct estimates of predation rates in aquaria were 33% and 37% on bleached and recently dead coral colonies, respectively, compared with 25% on healthy coral colonies. However, predation rates were highest (42%) on algal-covered corals, reflective of colonies that have further degraded after bleaching. We argue that increased susceptibility to predation may contribute to declines in abundance of coral-dwelling fishes after host coral bleaching. Even if predation does not cause increased in situ mortality, it is likely that increased exposure to predators will provide significant motivation for coral-dwelling fishes to vacate bleached coral hosts.									74	0	0	0	74	0	76			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000271813600007

Daily deposition of increments on the lapilli was validated for the first 35 d after hatching and the innermost increments were deposited from hatching onwards. The natural habitats of M. thoracata in French Guiana and Suriname showed considerable variation in physico-chemical characteristics of the water, density of food organisms and fish fauna. Instantaneous growth rates and size-at-age differed significantly among two vegetation types in Kaw Swamp (3.5% d(-1) and 4.1% d(-1)), Lelydorp Swamp (3.0% d(-1)) and Maykaboeka Creek (2.5% d(-1)). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between instantaneous growth rates and environmental parameters differed significantly from 0 only for water temperature.

Nonetheless, there is growing consensus that global marine primary production will decline in response to future climate change, largely due to increased stratification reducing the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean. Evidence to date suggests a potential amplification of this response throughout the trophic food web, with more dramatic responses at higher trophic levels. Here we show that trophic amplification of marine biomass declines is a consistent feature of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Models, across different scenarios of future climate change. Under the business-as-usual Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) global mean phytoplankton biomass is projected to decline by 6.1% +/- 2.5% over the twenty-first century, while zooplankton biomass declines by 13.6% +/- 3.0%. All models project greater relative declines in zooplankton than phytoplankton, with annual zooplankton biomass anomalies 2.24 +/- 1.03 times those of phytoplankton. The low latitude oceans drive the projected trophic amplification of biomass declines, with models exhibiting variable trophic interactions in the mid-to-high latitudes and similar relative changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. Under the assumption that zooplankton biomass is prey limited, an analytical explanation of the trophic amplification that occurs in the low latitudes can be derived from generic plankton differential equations. Using an ocean biogeochemical model, we show that the inclusion of variable C:N:P phytoplankton stoichiometry can substantially increase the trophic amplification of biomass declines in low latitude regions. This additional trophic amplification is driven by enhanced nutrient limitation decreasing phytoplankton N and P content relative to C, hence reducing zooplankton growth efficiency. Given that most current Earth System Models assume that phytoplankton C:N:P stoichiometry is constant, such models are likely to underestimate the extent of negative trophic amplification under projected climate change.									15	0	0	0	9	0	15			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000453370700018	30295401	
J	CHESNEY, EJ								A MODEL OF SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF STRIPED BASS LARVAE MORONE-SAXATILIS IN THE POTOMAC RIVER, 1987								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				92	1-2			15	25		10.3354/meps092015				JAN 1993	1993	A Stella(TM) model based on laboratory-derived growth data was developed to simulate abundances, cohort survival and growth rates of striped bass eggs and larvae. The goal was to compare the simulations to 1987 field survey results from the Potomac River (Cheasapeake Bay, USA). Key factors in the model were striped bass egg production, water temperature, surface light and penetration, turbidity and zooplankton concentration. Growth and survival were simulated from the predicted effects of turbidity, light at depth, and zooplankton concentration. Predation terms simulated survival under different predation pressures. The model estimated daily instantaneous growth rates ranging from -0.07 to 0.19 d-1. The model predicted poor survival and growth of cohorts produced early in the spawning season when water temperatures and zooplankton concentration were low. Mortality of eggs was predicted to be 54 % by simulation with most of the mortality attributable to low temperatures early in the spawning season. Simulated growth rates ranged widely and were highest in the down river sections of the Potomac. Predicted growth was in close agreement with field estimates during the second half of the spawning season. Early in the season, field growth rates were higher than those modeled, possibly because survival was more growth-rate dependent at that time than later when temperature, light and food levels were nearer to optimum. Trends in simulated larval abundances resembled Potomac River estimates but there were differences in simulated peak abundances. Mortality was partitioned and attributed to causes other than that caused by low temperature anomalies and growth-dependent factors. The difference between modeled and field observed larval abundances estimated a rate of mortality for 'other' causes at 13.7 % d-1, a rate that can readily be attributed to predation.									9	0	0	0	8	0	10			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:A1993KP58100002

Likely modulated by the intensity, frequency and duration of these events, dietary shifts during heat waves may threaten the stability of freshwaters. We investigated the effects of heat wave duration on diet assimilation and life-history traits of the freshwater gastropod Radix balthica. We compared the magnitude of the effects of a short (1 week) and a long heat wave (7 weeks) on the assimilation of animal- and plant-based diets, measuring performance in terms of growth rate and reproduction. We hypothesized that heat waves should increase the proportion of plant material assimilated on the mixed diet and change the performance of snails on the animal and plant-based diets. Both heat waves increased the assimilation of plant material on the mixed diet and growth rate, with minor negative effects on reproduction. However, responses were disproportional to heat wave duration, as the short heat wave elicited swift and relatively stronger responses. Our findings showcase the role of phenotypic plasticity in aiding ectotherms to cope with increased thermal stress and acclimate. Temporarily changing the strength of trophic interactions, heat waves may alter community dynamics in freshwater habitats.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000512772400002

We tested if surface ice influenced the behavior (swimming activity, aggressive encounters, and number of food items eaten) and stress level (coloration of eyes and body) of stream-living brown trout Salmo trutta at temperatures of 3-4 degrees C in indoor experimental flumes. We hypothesized that an individual's resting metabolic rate (RMR, as measured by resting ventilation rate) would affect winter behavior. Therefore, groups of 4 trout, consisting of individuals with high, low, or mixed (2 individuals each) RMR, were exposed to experimental conditions with or without ice cover. Ice cover reduced stress responses, as evaluated by body coloration. Also, trout in low RMR groups had a paler body color than those in both mixed and high RMR groups. Trout increased their swimming activity under ice cover, with the highest activity found in high RMR groups. Ice cover increased the number of aggressive encounters but did not influence the number of drifting food items taken by each group. In mixed RMR groups, however, single individuals were better able to monopolize food than in the other groups. As the presence of surface ice increases the activity level and reduces stress in stream-living trout, ice cover should influence their energy budgets and production. The results should be viewed in light of ongoing global warming that reduces the duration of ice cover, especially at high latitudes and altitudes.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000356585100024

At each temperature, 5-75 greenbugs were exposed to individual wasp mating pairs for 24 h. At all experimental temperatures, functional responses for both wasps most closely fit the type III model. Instantaneous attack rates (a) for A. colemani were not significantly different among experimental temperatures. However, for L. testaceipes, the estimate for a at 14degreesC was significantly lower than estimates at 22 and 26degreesC when data were fit to a type II functional response model. When data were fit to a type III functional response model for L. testaceipes, the estimate for a at 14degreesC was significantly lower than estimates at 18, 22, and 26degreesC. Superparasitism, for both wasps was often less than expected if superparasitism were a random occurrence, suggesting that these parasitoids may be able to sense when the host has been previously parasitized. A. colemani achieved higher parasitism rates than L. testaceipes at lower temperatures. This observations suggests that A. colemani may be an effective addition to the parasitoid guild for biological control of the greenbug during cooler periods in the Southern Great Plains.									46	4	0	0	43	1	49			0046-225X			WOS:000184052100002

We conducted three laboratory experiments to better define the temperature preference, tolerance limits, and temperature effects on feeding rates of juvenile Hemimysis, using individuals acclimated to mid (16 degrees C) and upper (22 degrees C) preferred temperature values previously reported for the species. For temperature preference, we fit a two-parameter Gaussian (mu, sigma) function to the experimental data, and found that the peak values (mu, interpreted as the preference temperature) were 22.0 degrees C (SE 0.25) when acclimated to 16 and 21.9 degrees C (SE 0.38) when acclimated to 22 degrees C, with the sigma-values of the curves at 2.6 and 2.5 degrees C, respectively. No mysids were observed in temperatures below 10 or above 28 degrees C in these preference experiments. In shortterm tolerance experiments for temperatures between 4 and 32 degrees C, all mysids died within 8 h at 30.2 degrees C for 16 degrees C acclimated mysids, and at 31.8 degrees C for 22 degrees C acclimated mysids. No lower lethal limit was found. Feeding rates increased with temperature from an average of 4 Bosmina eaten per hour at 5 degrees C to 19 Bosmina eaten per hour at 27 degrees C. The results of our experiments indicate an optimal temperature for Hemimysis between 21 and 27 degrees C, which corresponds with temperatures during periods of high population growth in the field. These results contribute a better understanding of this species' biological response to temperature that will help guide field studies and inform bioenergetics modeling.

To establish the extent to which this predator has an impact on the populations of its prey species, we have analysed the effect of prey availability on quantitative estimates of predation. We describe Piona functional responses generated under a range of conditions and compare them using 'parallel curve analysis' and a maximum likelihood method of estimating curve parameters. This method overcomes the difficulties of comparing parameters across different combinations of predator and prey type.Rates of predation on a range of cladoceran prey show 'thresholds' of prey size at which rates change abruptly. These thresholds are specific to each size of predator. Females, males and nymphs of Piona exhibit their highest predation rates on Daphnia carinata, Ceriodaphnia and Chydorus, respectively. These rates are relatively insensitive to temperatures above 15-degrees-C. Predation rates of adult Piona on Daphnia < 1.5 mm in length were similar to those of fourth instar Chaoborus at the same temperature and prey density.									13	0	0	0	12	0	13			0030-1299			WOS:A1993KG56400002

In all three lakes, there was a strong pattern with decreased P-content and increased C:P ratio in seston (< 150 mu m) coinciding with the increase in water temperature. The seston C:P ratios (at:at) were more than doubled with the rising temperature, i.e. from similar to 200 (at:at) in winter to 500 in summer. Sestonic C:P ratios increased over the growing season, suggesting that seasonal dynamics among autotrophs with high P-uptake in winter and support of subsequent phytoplankton growth by consumption of internal cellular P (P-quota) was the main cause of low sestonic P contents in late summer. This could, however, occur in concert with a physiologically driven decrease in cell-specific P at higher temperatures in summer. In contrast, the annual variation of C:P ratios of the zooplankton fraction was only 10% of that of seston. The variations of C:P ratios of the zooplankton were, nevertheless, strongly correlated with those of seston. For most of the summer, seston C:P ratios were far above the threshold ratio for P-limitation in Daphnia and other P-demanding species. This will pose further constraints on growth performance of Daphnia in these lakes, thus adding to the fish predation pressure and the poor food quality of cyanobacteria per se. The low grazing pressure causes a high biomass of low-quality autotrophs, promoting a stable state with low trophic transfer efficiency.									33	2	1	0	32	0	37			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000230207000005

Despite growing evidence of climate-induced effects on population trends of long-lived species, climate change remains generally overlooked in most risk assessments of seabirds. Because variation in climate may interact with the detrimental effects of bycatch, considering climate is of great importance, especially in the context of ongoing global warming. This paper examines the combined effects of bycatch and climate change on the persistence of one of the world's rarest birds, the Amsterdam Albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis, which has a single population in the upland plateau of Amsterdam Island (Southeast Indian Ocean). Using continuous monitoring from 1983 onwards, we first estimated the relationship between climate and the species' demographic parameters. We then built a stochastic matrix population model to estimate the population growth rate and the probability that the population declines below the level recorded in 1983 of nine breeding pairs under different scenarios involving the joint effects of additional mortality caused by longline fisheries and climate change. The results suggest that the demography of the Amsterdam Albatross is influenced by climate in both breeding and wintering grounds and that these relationships may to some extent compensate for the impact of additive bycatch mortality. However, these compensatory effects would be negligible if the annual additional mortality exceeds around six individuals per year, suggesting that the resumption of longline fishery in the foraging range of the Amsterdam Albatross would rapidly put this species at risk of extinction.									40	0	0	0	39	0	41			0019-1019	1474-919X		WOS:000272574000003

A wide window of migration phenology captures inter-annual variability of favourable conditions: Results of a whole-lake experiment with juvenile Pacific salmon								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				64	1			46	55		10.1111/fwb.13193				JAN 2019	2019	Survival of post-larval and juvenile organisms can depend on multiple seasonally-fluctuating features, including thermal conditions and food availability. Alterations in the phenology of either consumers or their prey might decouple trophic relationships and reduce consumer growth and survival, and this potential for mismatches is especially pronounced in migratory organisms that change habitats. Juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrate from natal streams to lake habitats, and we hypothesised that their in-lake growth and survival depends on whether timing of migration matches suitable lake conditions. We used mixed effects models to test the hypotheses that: (a) the most successful entry times correspond to favourable prey densities and lake thermal conditions; and (b) a mismatch in fish entry time and seasonal lake dynamics can reduce fish growth and survival. These models were applied to an 11-year time series of migration timing, capture rate and size at smolting for juvenile sockeye salmon in Lake Washington, WA, USA. Juvenile sockeye salmon entering Lake Washington later in the season encountered higher zooplankton abundance and warmer water, and experienced higher average rates of growth and survival, but the optimal date for lake entry ranged across years by up to a month. Zooplankton abundance and bloom timing affected fish growth and relative survival more than lake temperature, and survival was most influenced by zooplankton abundance in the spring when fish entered the lake. In contrast, fish size at seaward migration from the lake depended primarily on zooplankton abundance in the spring as they left the lake rather than the previous spring when they entered. These results suggest that maintaining a wide window of lake entry dates allows this population to capture the annually-varying period of favourable conditions, minimising mismatches between juvenile fish and their resources and thereby enabling successful recruitment in an unpredictable environment.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000453853500004

Most stages of O. sauteri exhibited Holling's Type-II response. The number of T. palmi consumed by O. sauteri nymphs increased with the stage of O. sauteri, however late fifth stage O. sauteri nymphs consumed a much smaller number of T. palmi larvae than early fifth stage nymphs. O. sauteri adult females consumed a slightly smaller number of T. palmi larvae than early fifth stage nymphs. O. sauteri adult males consumed a smaller number of T. palmi larvae than adult females. O. sauteri nymphs killed more T. palmi larvae than T. palmi adults. However, there was no marked difference between the two stages of T. palmi killed by O. sauteri adult females. The number of T. palmi consumed by O. sauteri adult females increased with increasing temperature. Selective predation experiments on O. sauteri on different stages of T. palmi revealed that the preference for T. palmi adults and larvae changed with the development of O. sauteri.									31	4	0	0	28	1	37			0003-6862			WOS:000165593600021

However, little is known about the effects of temperature and food concentration on its growth and grazing. Here, using the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina as prey, we determined the specific growth rate, cell volume, specific production, and ingestion rate of C. spatiosum at different temperatures and prey concentrations. These growth and grazing parameters typically followed a hyperbolic response to prey concentration. By applying iterative curve-fitting to the data at each temperature, we found that, with increasing temperature, the maximum specific growth rate, maximum specific production, and maximum ingestion rate of C. spatiosum generally increased, while the maximum cell volume decreased. The gross growth efficiency of C. spatiosum generally decreased at saturated prey concentration from about 45 to 25% as the temperature increased from 12 to 24 degrees C. By fitting these data iteratively to multi-variable nonlinear models, we obtained predictive equations for the growth rate, cell volume, and ingestion rate with respect to temperature and prey concentration.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0948-3055			WOS:000292988300008

Even though a longitudinal survey of five lakes (1994-2004) indicated that variation in Leptodora density was correlated with several indicators of habitat use (e.g., water temperature) and resource availability (e. g., zooplankton abundance), feeding experiments performed in both lit and unlit conditions demonstrated that a vertebrate predator (perch) strongly reduced Leptodora abundances under all conditions and always preferentially selected large-bodied individuals. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the migratory behavior of large Leptodora is consistent with an anti-predator defense strategy. To estimate the ecological significance of Leptodora DVM behavior, we modeled how predation rates on different zooplankton taxa differed between day and night in Katepwa Lake. We found that Leptodora had as much as five-fold higher prey-specific predation rates at night, particularly for intermediatesized prey. We conclude that ignoring the habitat use, size-structure, and vertical migration behavior of Leptodora could considerably underestimate the significance of invertebrate predation in lake food webs, particularly in eutrophic lakes where Leptodora can coexist at high densities with planktivorous fish.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000327393800019

The present study was performed to determine the relationship between growth rate and temperature effects on S. pygmaeus. Development and fecundity were investigated at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 +/- 1 degrees C and 60%+/- 10 relative humidity with 16 hours lighting in a growth chamber.The development time from egg to adult decreased with increasing temperatures. The longest development time was at 15 degrees C with 147.3 +/- 4.37 days and the shortest time was at 30 degrees C with 21.8 +/- 0.20 days, while development was not completed at 35 degrees C. The oviposition period was 22.00 +/- 4.22, 19.58 +/- 1.37 and 2.38 +/- 0.14 days at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. When the temperature effects on body size and weight of female and male individuals were compared, they were slight differences in size and weight at the same temperatures. Males and females reared at 25 degrees C were bigger than specimens reared at other temperatures. Daily and total egg production was highest at 25 degrees C, with 11.9 +/- 0.80/female/day and 258.4 +/- 12.25 per female. The net reproductive rate (R-o) and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) were highest at 25 degrees C at 109.31 females/female and 0.1235 females/female/day(-1), respectively, and average generation time (T-o) was lowest at 30 degrees C at 23.49 days.									4	1	0	0	4	0	6			1010-6960			WOS:000302335000002

While warming is expected to have a pronounced effect on plankton communities, many components of the plankton seem fairly robust towards realistic end-of-century acidification conditions. However, interactions of the two stressors and the inclusion of further factors such as nutrient concentration and trophic interactions are expected to change this outcome. We investigated the effects of warming and high CO2 on a nutrient-deplete late summer plankton community from the Kiel Fjord, Baltic Sea, using a mesocosm setup crossing two temperatures with a gradient of CO2. Phytoplankton and microzooplankton (MZP) growth rates as well as biomass, taxonomic composition, and grazing rates of MZP were analysed. We observed effects of high CO2, warming, and their interactions on all measured parameters. The occurrence and direction of the effects were dependent on the phytoplankton or MZP community composition. In addition, the abundance of small-sized phytoplankton was identified as one of the most important factors in shaping the MZP community composition. Overall, our results indicate that an estuarine MZP community used to strong natural fluctuations in CO2 can still be affected by a moderate increase in CO2 if it occurs in combination with warming and during a nutrient-deplete post-bloom situation. This highlights the importance of including trophic interactions and seasonality aspects when assessing climate change effects on marine zooplankton communities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000529324500001		
J	Rilov, G; Gasith, A; Benayahu, Y					Rilov, Gil/0000-0002-1334-4887			Effect of disturbance on foraging: whelk activity on wave-exposed rocky shores with minimal tidal range								MARINE BIOLOGY				147	2			421	428		10.1007/s00227-005-1568-y				JUN 2005	2005	For slow-moving rocky intertidal predators such as whelks, frequent stress can be detrimental. Most studies on the foraging behavior of whelks have been conducted in regions where tidal amplitude is > 1 m and on relatively small species. We studied the effects of wave action, desiccation, and water temperature on the foraging behavior of a large (approximately 80 mm) rocky shore whelk, Stramonita haemastoma, at the small-tide (< 40 cm) but wave-exposed Israeli Mediterranean coast. We hypothesized that in such conditions foraging activity of this large predator will be greatly limited. Field observations show that when wave height exceeds 0.5 m, activity of whelks decreases by at least threefold relative to that seen under calm-sea conditions, and most whelks remain inside shelters. Wave height data from offshore moorings demonstrate that such conditions occur along the coast > 85% of the time. Whelks move into shelters or completely disappear when exposed to prolonged desiccation conditions that can last for days along the shore during spring and autumn. Foraging activity is greater at night than in daytime and might be related to lighter winds and calmer sea conditions at night. Laboratory experiments show that elevated water temperatures during winter do not result in increased predation rates relative to those measured during spring. This indicates that a seasonal endogenous biological rhythm may exist. Our findings demonstrate that the foraging activity of large whelks can be extremely constrained by high rates of disturbance, that is, frequent wave action, and less frequent desiccation. We claim that high rates of disturbance in the eastern Mediterranean explain why large whelks are scarce in intertidal habitats where food is plentiful but suitable shelter is rare.									17	0	0	0	14	1	18			0025-3162			WOS:000229626500014

They can be divided by target levels in three groups: 1) at the organism level as ecophysiologic indicators, indicators such as RNA: DNA ratios, DNA: dry weight and RNA: protein, 2) at the population level, indicators such as growth rate, starvation incidence or fisheries impact indicators, and 3) at the community level, indicators such as trophic interactions, exergy indices and prey identification. The nucleic acids derived indices, especially RNA: DNA ratio, have been applied with success as indicators of nutritional condition, well been and growth in marine organisms. They are also useful as indicators of natural or anthropogenic impacts in marine population and communities, such as upwelling or dredge fisheries, respectively. They can help in understanding important issues of marine ecology such as trophic interactions in marine environment, fish and invertebrate recruitment failure and biodiversity changes, without laborious work of counting, measuring and identification of small marine organisms. Besides the objective of integrate nucleic acid derived indices across levels of organization, the paper will also include a general characterization of most used nucleic acid derived indices in marine ecology and also advantages and limitations of them. We can conclude that using indicators, such RNA: DNA ratios and other nucleic acids derived indices concomitantly with organism and ecosystems measures of responses to climate change (distribution, abundance, activity, metabolic rate, survival) will allow for the development of more rigorous and realistic predictions of the effects of anthropogenic climate change on marine systems.									101	1	0	0	92	5	106			1661-6596			WOS:000259735900008	19325815

In this study, oxygen consumption and lactate production were measured in P. sedentaria to estimate the aerobic and anaerobic contributions to total metabolism under conditions that mimic its day-(1% oxygen, 10 degrees C) and night-time (20% oxygen, 20 degrees C) habitat. When exposed to hypoxia and low temperature, the total metabolism of P. sedentaria was depressed by 78% compared with normoxic conditions. The metabolic enzymes citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also measured as indicators of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, and compared with specimens collected from the California Current and the North Atlantic to assess potential adaptations to low oxygen. LDH activity was not significantly different between regions. Significant differences in CS activity may be due to variation in food availability. Climate change is predicted to increase surface temperatures and cause the expansion of OMZs. This will result in vertical compression of the night-time range for P. sedentaria and is likely to have the same impact on other diel migrators. Habitat compression will reduce zooplankton contribution to carbon cycling and alter oceanic ecology, including predator-prey interactions.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000361993700006		
J	Limm, Michael P.; Marchetti, Michael P.								Juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) growth in off-channel and main-channel habitats on the Sacramento River, CA using otolith increment widths								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				85	2			141	151		10.1007/s10641-009-9473-8				JUN 2009	2009	Few studies have quantified juvenile salmon growth among different habitats or evaluated the mechanisms controlling salmon growth and survival. We used otolith microstructure to compare daily relative growth rates among main-channel riverine areas, off-channel ponds, and non-natal seasonal tributaries of the Sacramento River, CA. We compared prey availability, prey preference, and stomach fullness between these sites. We observed larger average otolith growth increments, higher prey densities, and warmer water temperatures in both off-channel ponds and non-natal seasonal tributaries compared to the main-channel areas in both 2001 and 2002. Our findings suggest that warmer temperatures and abundant prey in off-channel habitats during Central Valley Chinook salmon rearing periods may lead to higher growth rates, which in turn may improve juvenile survival. Our results suggest that off-channel habitats may be critical habitats to include in conservation and management plans for juvenile salmon.									30	0	0	0	30	1	30			0378-1909			WOS:000266081600008

We maintained yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in holding tanks throughout a twenty-year period, routinely collecting data on mass and length of individual fish over time. The water temperature of the holding tanks was maintained at 19.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C (mean +/- s.d.) and the yellowfin tuna were fed a diet amounting to 176 +/- 36 kJ center dot kg(-1) of tuna biomass center dot day(-1) across the study period. We integrated length records (n = 249) with a prior model of yellowfin tuna age to generate a von Bertalanffy growth function for this captive scenario with the parameters 224.26 cm straight fork length (SFL), 0.099, and -1.721 years for L-infinity, k, and t(o), respectively. We combined our growth model and analyses of tuna tissue energy with metabolic data from various sources to estimate a bioenergetic budget for this difficult -to-study species. We found that the captive tunas in this experiment grew significantly slower than yellowfin tuna studied in the wild and in other captive scenarios. Our energetic budget indicates that only 7.8% of an ingested meal's energetic content was utilized for growth. Furthermore, we calculated an average food conversion ratio of 37.2:1 for an 8.4 kg yellowfin tuna when fed a mixed-diet of squid, sardine, and vitamin gelatin. We conclude with a discussion of the various factors influencing tuna bioenergetics including the role of water temperature, diet, and inter-species competition on growth and energy assimilation. These findings are uniquely suited to the relatively cool temperatures and low energy diet maintained in this captive scenario, an important consideration for others hoping to draw on these results for comparative research.

Examination of stomach contents revealed that black carp and redear sunfish crush snails, whereas blue catfish do not. Electivity indices showed that large black carp randomly consumed snails from all shell lengths, whereas large redear sunfish avoided snails larger than 13 mm. Large black carp, redear sunfish, and blue catfish consumed commercial feed when provided in conjunction with snails. The largest amount of snail consumption by all fish species occurred at 26 degrees C, and declined slightly as water temperature decreased from 26 degrees C to 12 degrees C. Black carp were the most effective consumers of rams-horn snails and did not show any preference for a particular size or range of sizes of snails. Redear sunfish consumed significantly fewer snails than black carp but significantly more than blue catfish. In this study, redear sunfish were a better biological control of rams-horn snails than blue catfish but not as effective as the exotic black carp. However. further studies need to be conducted under natural conditions to determine whether the presence of other natural prey items will affect the selectivity of redear sunfish with respect to rams-horn snails.									18	0	0	0	15	0	18			1522-2055			WOS:000242979900008

Whether or not marine organisms thriving in this cold stenothermal environment are able to cope with warming is of concern. Here, we present changes to the growth and shell characteristics of the ecologically important, small and short lived brooding bivalve Lissarca miliaris from Signy Island, Antarctica. Using material collected from the 1970's to the present day, we show an increase in growth rate and adult shell deterioration accompanied by a decrease in offspring size, associated with an increase in annual average temperatures. Critical changes to the bivalve's ecology seen today evidence the problem of a shift in baseline since the onset of warming recorded in Antarctica. These small bivalves are demonstrating ecophysiological responses to subtle warming that, provided warming continues, could soon surpass a physiological tipping point, adding to warming associated threats such as increased predatory pressure and ocean acidification.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000313051500153	23285298

Hypoxia occurs seasonally in many stratified coastal marine and freshwater ecosystems when bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are depleted below 2-3 mg O-2 L-1.2. We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on fish habitat quality in the central basin of Lake Erie from 1987 to 2005, using bioenergetic growth rate potential (GRP) as a proxy for habitat quality. We compared the effect of hypoxia on habitat quality of (i) rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax mordax Mitchill (young-of-year, YOY, and adult), a cold-water planktivore, (ii) emerald shiner, Notropis atherinoides Rafinesque (adult), a warm-water planktivore, (iii) yellow perch, Perca flavescens Mitchill (YOY and adult), a cool-water benthopelagic omnivore and (iv) round goby Neogobius melanostomus Pallas (adult) a eurythermal benthivore. Annual thermal and DO profiles were generated from 1D thermal and DO hydrodynamics models developed for Lake Erie's central basin.3. Hypoxia occurred annually, typically from mid-July to mid-October, which spatially and temporally overlaps with otherwise high benthic habitat quality. Hypoxia reduced the habitat quality across fish species and life stages, but the magnitude of the reduction varied both among and within species because of the differences in tolerance to low DO levels and warm-water temperatures.4. Across years, trends in habitat quality mirrored trends in phosphorus concentration and water column oxygen demand in central Lake Erie. The per cent reduction in habitat quality owing to hypoxia was greatest for adult rainbow smelt and round goby (mean: -35%), followed by adult emerald shiner (mean: -12%), YOY rainbow smelt (mean: -10%) and YOY and adult yellow perch (mean: -8.5%).5. Our results highlight the importance of differential spatiotemporally interactive effects of DO and temperature on relative fish habitat quality and quantity. These effects have the potential to influence the performance of individual fish species as well as population dynamics, trophic interactions and fish community structure.									71	1	0	0	61	1	73			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000285999100013

Using projections of climate scenarios for the year 2060, we evaluated how several possible futures could affect wildlife populations (wading birds, fish, alligators, native apple snails, amphibians, threatened and invasive species) across the Everglades landscape and inform planning already underway. We used data collected from prior research and monitoring to parameterize our wildlife population models. Hydrologic data were simulated using a spatially explicit, regional-scale model. Our scenario evaluations show that expected changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level could significantly alter important ecological functions. All of our wildlife indicators were negatively affected by scenarios with less rainfall and more evapotranspiration. Under such scenarios, habitat suitability was substantially reduced for iconic animals such as wading birds and alligators. Conversely, the increased rainfall scenario benefited aquatic prey productivity and apex predators. Cascading impacts on non-native species is speculative, but increasing temperatures could increase the time between cold events that currently limit expansion and abundance of non-native fishes, amphibians, and reptiles with natural ranges in the tropics. This scenario planning framework underscored the benefits of proceeding with Everglades restoration plans that capture and clean more freshwater with the potential to mitigate rainfall loss and postpone impacts of sea level rise.									18	0	0	0	11	1	19			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000351838300006	25371194

At small scales, intra-and interspecific competition for refugia from high flows and predation can affect the microdistribution of lotic organisms. The abiotic environment, such as water temperature, can have important impacts on lotic organism behavior, potentially influencing competitive and predator-prey dynamics. In the laboratory, we examined activity and refuge use of stonefly nymphs, Pteronarcys californica, in the presence and absence of conspecifics and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) across three temperatures. We predicted that at high temperatures competitive dynamics would decrease in importance. Crayfish captured and consumed stoneflies in similar to 25% of trials indicating that crayfish are effective predators as well as competitors for refuge. Crayfish influenced stonefly activity and refuge use, and their effect varied with time of day. During the day, crayfish hid in refuge; in response, stoneflies reduced refuge use and increased activity. At night, crayfish decreased refuge use and increased crawling resulting in a sharp decline in stonefly activity. These behavioral responses to crayfish may impact P. californica fitness as increased day-time activity increases risk of detection by visual predators and decreased night-time activity might decrease encounters with food resources. In contrast to the strong impacts of crayfish, stonefly density and water temperature did not significantly affect stonefly or crayfish refuge use or behavior. Our results indicate that a large competitor and potential predator has strong impacts on the microdistribution and behavior of P. californica.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1863-9135			WOS:000298141900006

Recorded stomach temperatures and differences between stomach and ambient water temperatures were consistent with shortfin maim (Isurus oxyrinchus) and porbeagle (Lamna nasus) sharks. Vertical behavior in the form of diel migrations, deep dives and extensive periods spent close to the surface during day and night time was again consistent with Lamnid sharks. The observed predation rate was considered to be elevated due to irregular post-release behavior as opposed to symptomatic of natural mortality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Eggs, larvae and juveniles were reared in cross-factored treatments of temperature (21 and 25 degrees C) and pCO(2) (500 and 985atm) from fertilisation to 25days post hatching (dph). Temperature had the greatest effect on survival, growth and development. Survivorship was lower, but growth and morphological development were faster at 25 degrees C, with surviving fish larger and more developed at 1, 11 and 21dph. Elevated pCO(2) affected size at 1dph, but not at 11 or 21dph, and did not affect survival or morphological development. Elevated temperature and pCO(2) had opposing effects on swimming performance at 21dph. Critical swimming speed (U-crit) was increased by elevated temperature but reduced by elevated pCO(2). Additionally, elevated temperature increased the proportion of individuals that responded to a startle stimulus, reduced latency to respond and increased maximum escape speed, potentially due to the more advanced developmental stage of juveniles at 25 degrees C. By contrast, elevated pCO(2) reduced the distance moved and average speed in response to a startle stimulus. Our results show that higher temperature is likely to be the primary driver of global change impacts on kingfish early life history; however, elevated pCO(2) could affect critical aspects of swimming performance in this pelagic species. Our findings will help parameterise and structure fisheries population dynamics models and improve projections of impacts to large pelagic fishes under climate change scenarios to better inform adaptation and mitigation responses.									20	0	0	0	19	0	20			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000441746900039	29790239

Many local populations are experiencing reduced reproductive success as a consequence of mismatches, but few mismatches have led to species-level population declines. To better understand this apparent paradox, we investigated the breeding phenology and chick survival of two disjunct populations of Hudsonian godwits Limosa haemastica breeding at Churchill, Manitoba and Beluga River, Alaska. Only one population experienced a mismatch: godwits bred nearly one week after the onset of the invertebrate peak at Churchill because of asynchronous climatic change occurring throughout their annual cycle. However, chicks were not uniformly affected by the mismatch -growth rates and survival of young chicks were not correlated with invertebrate abundance, but older chicks tended to suffer lower survival rates on days of low invertebrate abundance. Ecological mismatches thus resulted in a complex array of consequences, but nonetheless contributed to reductions in chick survival. In contrast, godwits at Beluga River hatched their chicks just before the invertebrate peak, such that the period of highest energetic need coincided with the period of highest invertebrate abundance. As a result, growth rates and survival of godwit chicks were unaffected by invertebrate abundance. Godwits at Beluga River were able to properly time their reproduction because of predictable rates of climatic change and strong selection imposed by high predation on late-hatched chicks. Taken together, our results suggest that population-specific, local-scale selection pressures play a critical role in determining the degree and severity of ecological mismatches. The potential for global climate change to induce species-level population declines may therefore be mediated by the spatial variation in the selection pressures acting across a species' range.									34	0	0	0	28	0	33			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000391947400007

To investigate how cross-ecosystem differences in these drivers determine fish assemblages and productivity, we constructed a spatially explicit mechanistic model of three fish functional types: forage, large pelagic, and demersal fishes. The model is based on allometric scaling principles, includes basic life cycle transitions, and has trophic interactions between the fishes and with their pelagic and benthic food resources. The model was applied to the global ocean, with plankton food web estimates and ocean conditions from a high-resolution earth system model. Further, a simple representation of fishing was included, and led to moderate matches with total, large pelagic, and demersal catches, including re-creation of observed variations in fish catch spanning two orders of magnitude. Our results highlight several ecologically meaningful model sensitivities. First, coexistence between forage and large pelagic fish in productive regions occurred when forage fish survival is promoted via both favorable metabolic allometry and enhanced predator avoidance in adult forage fish. Second, the prominence of demersal fish is highly sensitive to the efficiency of energy transfer to benthic invertebrates. Third, the latitudinal distribution of the total catch is modulated by the temperature dependence of metabolic rates, with increased sensitivity pushing fish biomass toward the poles. Fourth, forage fish biomass is suppressed by strong top-down controls on temperate and subpolar shelves, where mixed assemblages of large pelagic and demersal fishes exerted high predation rates. Last, spatial differences in the dominance of large pelagics vs. demersals is strongly related to the ratio of pelagic zooplankton production to benthic production. We discuss the potential linkages between model misfits and unresolved processes including movement, spawning phenology, seabird and marine mammal predators, and socioeconomically driven fishing pressure, which are identified as priorities for future model development. Ultimately, the model and analyses herein are intended as a baseline for a robust, mechanistic tool to understand, quantify, and predict global fish biomass and yield, now and in a future dominated by climate change and improved fishing technology.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0079-6611			WOS:000483411800010		
J	Reichert, MJM								Diet, consumption, and growth of juvenile fringed flounder (Etropus crossotus); a test of the 'maximum growth/optimum food hypothesis' in a subtropical nursery area								JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				50	2-3			97	116		10.1016/S1385-1101(03)00081-9				NOV 2003	2003	Recent somatic growth of juvenile fringed flounder (Etropus crossotus) collected in North Inlet (South Carolina, USA) was determined based on the width of the 24 most recently deposited daily increments in sagittal otoliths. Growth rates were estimated using previously published data on the experimentally validated relationship between the daily increment width and the somatic growth. A comparison of the realised growth with experimental data indicated that growth rates in the field were near optimum values determined under ad libitum food conditions. Gut contents analysis of field collected fringed flounder indicated that food consisted predominantly of zooplankton and motile epibenthic prey with calanoid copepods, in particular Pseudodiaptomus coronatus, as the most important food items. There was no clear ontogenetic shift in prey with increasing fish size. Copepods and their eggs remained a significant prey item in even the largest fish examined (>9 cm SL), while larger prey items like polychaete worms, cumaceans, bivalves, and mysids were found in the stomachs of smaller fish. The prey organisms were abundantly available during the period of highest settlement (May through September). Growth rates, biomass, consumption estimates, and prey availability in North Inlet indicated that growth of juvenile fringed flounder is not limited by food, but predominantly determined by water temperature. During the summer months temperature and food supply in North Inlet are near optimal for juvenile fringed flounder. This allows this short-lived species to grow rapidly to attain a mature size and migrate to near-shore waters to reproduce within one growing season. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Physiological processes in general are sensitive to temperature. Thus, the temperature at which predators and prey interact may shape physiological response to predation risk. We measured and evaluated how temperature and predation risk affected growth rates of predaceous damselfly nymphs (Enallagma vesperum, Odonata: Coenagrionidae). First, we conducted growth trials at five temperatures crossed with two levels of predation risk (fish predator present versus absent) and measured growth rates, consumption rates, assimilation efficiencies, and production efficiencies of 107 individual damselflies. Second, we used a model to evaluate if and how component physiological responses to predation risk affected growth rates across temperatures. In the absence of mortality threat, growth rates of damselflies increased with warming until about 23.5 A degrees C and then began to decline, a typical unimodal response to changes in temperature. Under predation risk, growth rates were lower and the shape of the thermal response was less apparent. Higher metabolic and survival costs induced by predation risk were only partially offset by changes in consumption rates and assimilation efficiencies and the magnitude of non-consumptive effects varied as a function of temperature. Furthermore, we documented that thermal physiology was mediated by predation risk, a known driver of organismal physiology that occurs in the context of species interactions. A general understanding of climatic impacts on ectothermic populations requires consideration of the community context of thermal physiology, including non-consumptive effects of predators.									34	1	0	0	31	1	35			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000344599000005	25234372

Population dynamics of a northern-adapted mammal: disentangling the influence of predation and climate change								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				25	6			1546	1556		10.1890/14-2214.1				SEP 2015	2015	Community structure and interspecific interactions are particularly vulnerable to rapidly changing climatic regimes. Recent changes in both climate and vertebrate community assemblages have created a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of two dynamic forces on population regulation. We examined the effects of warming winter conditions and the reestablishment of a previously extirpated predator, the fisher (Martes pennanti), on regulatory mechanisms in a northern-adapted mammal, the porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), along their southern range boundary. Using a long-term (17-year) capture-recapture data set, we (1) quantified the impacts of climate change and increased fisher predation on the survival of adult porcupines at their regional southern terminus, (2) assessed recruitment (via both adult fecundity and juvenile survival) of porcupines, and (3) modeled the relative importance of predation and winter conditions on the demography and population growth rate (lambda). Severe winters and abundant predators interacted synergistically to reduce adult survivorship by as much as 44%, while expanding predator populations led to near reproductive failure among porcupines. Increasing predatory pressure, disruptions in this community module, and more frequent extreme winter weather events led to predicted extirpation within 50 years, whereas in the absence of predators, the population was viable. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding behind distributional shifts resulting from climate change and may be broadly relevant for predicting future distributional shifts in other northern-adapted mammalian species.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000360813100009	26552263

The model incorporated 40 living functional groups representing the Baltic Sea coastal system of Lithuania during the first decade of 21rst century. The overall pedigree index of our model was relatively high (0.66) as much of the input data originated from the study area. The results indicate net heterotrophy of the coastal zone due to strong influences from the nearby river lagoon system (Curonian Lagoon). The majority of fish species and waterbirds were present in the coastal system on a seasonal basis and their migrations contributed to heterotrophic conditions. Among fish, the freshwater stragglers possibly contribute to the reversal of flow in biomass and energy from the coastal zone to the river-lagoon system. Top predators such as breeding and wintering piscivorous waterbirds and large pike-perch were identified as keystone species. There was a clear negative balance for the biomass of small marine pelagic fishes such as smelt, sprat and Baltic herring which represent the main prey items in this system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	SEBENS, KP								BIODIVERSITY OF CORAL-REEFS - WHAT ARE WE LOSING AND WHY								AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST				34	1			115	133						1994	1994	Coral reefs are threatened by numerous anthropogenic impacts, some of which have already had major effects worldwide. These unique tropical environments harbor a high diversity of corals, reef invertebrates, fish and other animals and plants. In most taxa, the species diversity of reef-associated organisms is poorly understood because many of the species have yet to be collected and described. High coral mortality has been associated with natural events such as hurricanes, predator outbreaks and periods of high temperature, but has also resulted from excess nutrients in sewage and from specific pollutants. Reef corals and associated organisms are also threatened by the possibility of global warming which will result in rising sea levels and periods of increased temperature stress, and which may also bring increased storm frequency and intensity. Although the recent extensive episodes of coral bleaching in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific cannot be causally related to global warming at this time, the close link between bleaching and temperature suggests that global warming will result in severe changes in coral assemblages. Major reef destruction has followed outbreaks of the predatory seastar Acanthaster planci in the Pacific. Although this is considered part of a natural disturbance cycle, there are indications that altered land use patterns and reduction of predators on this seastar by human activities may have increased the severity of outbreaks. Recreational and commercial use of reefs has also increased, and has caused extensive damage, especially near areas of high population density. One of the most obvious and widespread losses to reef biota is the reduction in fish populations from intense overfishing in most reef areas of the world. Coasts without adequately managed reefs have suffered intense overfishing for both local and export purposes, to the point where the positive effects of fish on those reefs have been compromised. The combination of these destructive factors has altered reefs in all localities, and many that were once considered protected by distance and low population density are now being exploited as well. On the positive side, improved understanding of ecological processes on reefs combined with concerted conservation efforts have managed to protect some extensive areas of reef for the future.									113	1	1	0	95	4	118			0003-1569			WOS:A1994PL53900012

Not only average daily temperature, but also diurnal temperature variations may affect prey consumption and life history traits of ectotherms. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations on body size, predation capacity and oviposition rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) when presented with eggs of their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). For both predators, mean daily temperature as well as temperature alternation had a substantial impact on the number of prey consumed. At lower average temperatures, more eggs were killed under an alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C and 25 A degrees C/10 A degrees C) than at the corresponding mean constant temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C). At higher average temperatures (> 25 A degrees C), however, the opposite was observed with higher numbers of prey killed at constant temperatures than at alternating temperatures. At 25 A degrees C, temperature variation had no effect on the predation capacity. A similar trend as for the predation rates was observed for the oviposition rates of the phytoseiids. Body size of N. californicus was affected both by average daily temperature and temperature variation, with smaller adult females emerging at alternating temperatures than at constant temperatures, whereas for P. persimilis, temperature variation had no impact on its body size. Our results demonstrate that temperature variations are likely to affect biological control of T. urticae by the studied phytoseiid predators.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000360999800002

Daphnids, which are important grazers on phytoplankton and a major food source for fish and invertebrates, are sensitive to not only changes in salinity levels, but also presence of predators. In this study, the interactive effect of salinity toxicity (abiotic factor) with predation pressure mimicked by the fish-exuded kairomone (biotic factor) and the effect of salt acclimation on daphnids were investigated. Impacts of these stressors on daphnid survival, life history and molecular profile were observed. The presence of the kairomone antagonistically alters the effect of salinity, as observed from the 24- and 48-h LC50 values and survival results. Molecular findings provided solid evidence to this antagonism at even lower salt concentrations, for which antagonism was not evident with organismal data. Fish predation counterbalances the negative effect of salinity in terms of reserve energy density. Therefore, it is important to investigate multiple stressor effects in ecotoxicological bioassays complemented with molecular techniques. The single effect of increasing salinity resulted in increased mortality, decreased fecundity, and slower somatic growth in Daphnia, despite their acclimation to salinity. This insignificance of acclimation indicates that Daphnia do not have any physiological mechanisms to buffer the adverse effects of salinity, making it a very crucial factor. Salinity-induced reduction in population growth rate of freshwater keystone species Daphnia-despite acclimation-indicates that global warming-induced salinity may cascade through the food web and lead to dramatic environmental consequences in the structure of lake ecosystems.									20	0	0	0	16	0	20			0963-9292	1573-3017		WOS:000300251000029	22102012

Despite a growing number of single-species studies that identified phenological mismatches as a nearly universal consequence of climate change, we have a limited understanding of the spatial variation in the intensity of this phenomenon and what influences this variation. In this study, we tested for geographic patterns in phenological mismatches between six species of shorebirds and their invertebrate prey at 10 sites spread across similar to 13 degrees latitude and similar to 84 degrees longitude in the Arctic over three years. At each site, we quantified the phenological mismatch between shorebirds and their invertebrate prey at (1) an individual-nest level, as the difference in days between the seasonal peak in food and the peak demand by chicks, and (2) a population level, as the overlapped area under fitted curves for total daily biomass of invertebrates and dates of the peak demand by chicks. We tested whether the intensity of past climatic change observed at each site corresponded with the extent of phenological mismatch and used structural equation modeling to test for causal relationships among (1) environmental factors, including geographic location and current climatic conditions, (2) the timing of invertebrate emergence and the breeding phenology of shorebirds, and (3) the phenological mismatch between the two trophic levels. The extent of phenological mismatch varied more among different sites than among different species within each site. A greater extent of phenological mismatch at both the individual-nest and population levels coincided with changes in the timing of snowmelt as well as the potential dissociation of long-term snow phenology from changes in temperature. The timing of snowmelt also affected the shape of the food and demand curves, which determined the extent of phenological mismatch at the population level. Finally, we found larger mismatches at more easterly longitudes, which may be affecting the population dynamics of shorebirds, as two of our study species show regional population declines in only the eastern part of their range. This suggests that phenological mismatches may be resulting in demographic consequences for Arctic-nesting birds.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000479658300001

The benefit to rearing off Kodiak Island vs. in the Semidi Islands vicinity increased among years with body length because larger fish consumed more euphausiids, and euphausiids were apparently more available in the Kodiak region. This explains previously observed regional variation in body size, condition, and growth rates within the GOA population and points to potential importance of the Kodiak region as a walleye pollock nursery. During September 2005, 2007, and 2009, Kodiak midwater was cooler and saltier than Semidi midwater, presumably due to a relatively narrow continental shelf and greater oceanic influence. Zooplankton composition differed between regions with the greater euphausiid population density off Kodiak being most relevant to walleye pollock food habits. As found historically, age-0 walleye pollock abundance was lower in the Kodiak region than in the Semidi region. However, the Kodiak fish were larger in both length and length-specific weight, and had fuller stomachs than Semidi fish, although differences were not significant in all years. Regional differences were most pronounced during the relatively warmyear 2005 when fish were particularly large. Fish dietary mass was dominated by euphausiids, especially for Kodiak fish= 55 mmstandard length. Bioenergetics model output suggests that the greater euphausiid dietary proportion translates into faster growth of the Kodiak fish. The midwater habitat off Kodiak Island might therefore support above-average production of recruits to the GOA adult population due to better condition and likely survival of walleye pollock juveniles, especially when fish are large and thus able to more fully exploit euphausiids, but confirmation of above-average production of recruits depends on our ability to determine spatial structure in juvenile-adult population connectivity.									8	0	0	0	5	0	8			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000326042000013

Especially poorly-studied in arctic waters are the gelatinous zooplankton, which are difficult to study using traditional oceanographic methods. A distinct zooplanktivore community was characterized in the surface 100 m by use of a Remotely Operated Vehicle, net collections, and SCUBA diving. The large scyphomedusa, Chrysaora melanaster, was associated with the warm Pacific water at similar to 35-75 m depth. A diverse ctenophore community lived mainly above the C. melanaster layer, including Dryodora glandula, a specialized predator of larvaceans, Beroe cucumis, a predator of other ctenophores, and the extremely fragile Bolinopsis infundibulum, which was the most abundant species. Gut content analyses showed that Mertensia ovum selectively consumed the largest copepods (Calanus spp.) and amphipods (Parathemisto libellula): B. infundibulum consumed smaller copepods and pteropods (Limacina helicina). Large copepods were digested by M. ovum in similar to 12 h at -1.5 to 0 degrees C, but by B. infundibulum in only similar to 4 h. We estimated that M. ovum consumed an average of similar to 2% d(-1) of the Calanus spp. copepods and that B. infundibulum consumed similar to 4% d(-1) of copepods < 3 mm prosome length. These are significant consumption rates given that Calanus spp. have life-cycles of 2 or more years and are eaten by vertebrates including bowhead whales and arctic cod. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Stocking densities are often estimated by modelling resource availability, but this can be difficult for lower trophic level species, such as crustaceans, which can consume a wide variety of difficult-to-sample food resources. We present a stocking model that uses net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) as the basis for a production-based stocking model, which simulates maximum stocking density by balancing NEM with consumption by the stocked organism. In a case study of a stocked prawn in an estuary, stocking density was large at approximately 11 million prawns (in 4 km2), with a 95% confidence interval of 4.3-32.4 million. This was due to high NEM, low prawn trophic level (2.2), lake-wide habitat suitability, and was based on dedicating 1% of the benthic primary production to stocked prawns. Prawn consumption peaked 6-8 wk after stocking, and prawn biomass peaked 14-16 wk after stocking (approximately 16 t). Our simulation showed that food limitation is a determining factor for cohorts with fast growth, but as growth slowed, other density-dependent factors (namely space limitation) influenced stocking density. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the importance of growth rate on stocking density; thus, accurate measures of growth and its temperature-dependence should be a priority for stocked species. Using NEM as a basis for resource limitation by stocked consumers allows the temporal dynamics of both primary production and consumption to be incorporated, and is a powerful approach for calculating stocking densities for low trophic level consumers with diverse diets, such as prawns, shrimps, and crabs.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0007-4977	1553-6955		WOS:000475493600007

The seasonal dynamics in temperate lake plankton communities, with emphasis on both physical and biological forcing factors, were captured in the 1980s in a conceptual framework, the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. 2.Taking the PEG model as our starting point, we discuss anticipated changes in seasonal and long-term plankton dynamics and extend this model to other climate regions, particularly polar and tropical latitudes. Based on our improved post-PEG understanding of plankton dynamics, we also evaluate the role of microbial plankton, parasites and fish in governing plankton dynamics and distribution. 3.In polar lakes, there is usually just a single peak in plankton biomass in summer. Lengthening of the growing season under warmer conditions may lead to higher and more prolonged phytoplankton productivity. Climate-induced increases in nutrient loading in these oligotrophic waters may contribute to higher phytoplankton biomass and subsequent higher zooplankton and fish productivity. 4.In temperate lakes, a seasonal pattern with two plankton biomass peaks in spring and summer can shift to one with a single but longer and larger biomass peak as nutrient loading increases, with associated higher populations of zooplanktivorous fish. Climate change will exacerbate these trends by increasing nutrient loading through increased internal nutrient inputs (due to warming) and increased catchment inputs (in the case of more precipitation). 5.In tropical systems, temporal variability in precipitation can be an important driver of the seasonal development of plankton. Increases in precipitation intensity may reset the seasonal dynamics of plankton communities and favour species adapted to highly variable environments. The existing intense predation by fish on larger zooplankters may increase further, resulting in a perennially low zooplankton biomass. 6.Bacteria were not included in the original PEG model. Seasonally, bacteria vary less than the phytoplankton but often follow its patterns, particularly in colder lakes. In warmer lakes, and with future warming, a greater influx of allochthonous carbon may obscure this pattern. 7.Our analyses indicate that the consequences of climate change for plankton dynamics are, to a large extent, system specific, depending on characteristics such as food-web structure and nutrient loading. Indirect effects through nutrient loading may be more important than direct effects of temperature increase, especially for phytoplankton. However, with warming a general picture emerges of increases in bacterivory, greater cyanobacterial dominance and smaller-bodied zooplankton that are more heavily impacted by fish predation.									144	2	0	0	133	5	152			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000314805800002

Despite the widespread occurrence of morphological antipredator mechanisms, no studies have tested how these can affect the sensitivity of prey to pesticides. Sensitivity to pesticides is typically measured via reductions in growth rates and survival, but also reductions in heat tolerance are to be expected and are becoming increasingly important in a warming world. We investigated how autotomy, a widespread morphological antipredator mechanism where animals sacrifice a body part (here the caudal lamellae) to escape when attacked by a predator, modified the sensitivity to the insecticide chlorpyrifos in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. Exposure to chlorpyrifos reduced the growth rate and heat tolerance (measured as CTmax). A key finding was that the pesticide had a greater impact on growth rates of intact animals, i.e. those that retained their lamellae. This reduced sensitivity to chlorpyrifos in animals without lamellae can be explained by the reduced outer surface area which is expected to result in a lower uptake of the pesticide. Larvae that underwent autotomy exhibited a lower heat tolerance, which may also be explained by the reduced surface area and the associated reduction in oxygen uptake. There is a wide diversity of morphological antipredator mechanisms, suggesting that there will be more examples where these mechanisms affect the vulnerability to pollutants. Given the importance of pollution and predation as structuring forces in aquatic food webs, exploring the potential interactions between morphological antipredator mechanisms and sensitivity to pollutants will be crucial for risk assessment of pollutants in aquatic systems.

The mechanisms behind this pattern, however, remain unaddressed. Using visual sampling of potential predators and live flies as baits, we assessed predation patterns along 4,000-m elevation transects on either side of the equatorial Andes. At the lower elevations, we found that around 80% of predation events on our insect baits were due to ants. The decline in predation with elevation was driven mainly by a decline in the abundance of ants, whose importance relative to other predators also declined. We show that both predator density and activity (predation rate per individual predator) decreased with elevation, thus ascribing specific mechanisms to known predation patterns. We suggest that changes in these two mechanisms may reflect changes in primary productivity and metabolic rate with temperature, factors of potential relevance across latitudinal and other macroecological gradients, particularly for ectotherm predators and prey.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000482091000006	31553213

MARINE BIOLOGY				163	4					78	10.1007/s00227-016-2850-x				APR 2016	2016	Climate change can have major effects on the distribution of species. In marine ecosystems, the cold waters of the Arctic have restricted warmer water species from crossing between Eurasia and North America. However, with Arctic waters becoming warmer, various marine species have expanded their distribution. Cuttlefish are fast-growing, voracious predators and are absent in American waters. The European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis is the most northerly distributed cuttlefish, with potential to expand its range and cross to the American continent, potentially causing changes in shelf food webs. Climate model predictions suggest that the S. officinalis could potentially reach American shores, by 2300 via the north Atlantic with medium mitigation of greenhouse gas concentrations; we predict that adult dispersal of cuttlefish across the Atlantic sector would require a migration distance of over 1400 km at depths below 200 m and temperatures above 7 degrees C (temperature below which cuttlefish can not maintain routine metabolic processes physiologically). For temperatures above 9.5 degrees C (temperature above which cuttlefish can grow), 2500 km would be required, and such conditions will possibly exist by the year 2300. If they reach American shores they could have large impacts on coastal marine ecosystems, due to their wide diet (e.g. diet covers many shallow-water crustacean and fish species) and its potential as prey, and due to their short life-history strategy of "live fast, die young".									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000373019300011

Organisms often have smaller body sizes under warmer climates (Bergmann's rule and the temperature-size rule), and body size is a major determinant of life histories, demography, population size, nutrient turnover rate, and food-web structure. Therefore, by altering body sizes in whole communities, current warming can potentially disrupt ecosystem function and services. However, the underlying drivers of warming-induced body downsizing remain far from clear. Here, we show that thermal clines in body size are predicted from universal laws of ecology and metabolism, so that size-dependent selection from competition (both intra and interspecific) and predation favors smaller individuals under warmer conditions. We validate this prediction using 4.1x10(6) individual body size measurements from French river fish spanning 29years and 52 species. Our results suggest that warming-induced body downsizing is an emergent property of size-structured food webs, and highlight the need to consider trophic interactions when predicting biosphere reorganizations under global warming.									34	0	0	0	31	0	35			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000323844200013	23780903

Seven species were found. Paralichthys dentatus, Paralichthys lethostigma, Paralichthys oblongus and Trinectus maculatus were relatively rare. Etropus crossotus, Citharichthys spilopterus and Symphurus plagiusa were abundant and settled during the period studied. E. crossotus was the most abundant species with a mean abundance of 18 ind.10(-2) m-2 (max. 287). Demersal settlement of E. crossotus took place in shallow areas and over sandy bottoms from mid-May to August. Prolonged settlement hampered the calculation of growth rate and instantaneous mortality rate. However, laboratory growth experiments indicated a mean growth of about 0.50 mm.d-1 at 24-28-degrees-C. Juveniles of C. spilopterus were already present in the Duplin River in March. Settling continued until the end of April with a mean abundance of 3.5 ind.10(-2) m-2 (max. 183). With increasing size the juveniles of this species tended to migrate to deeper waters and to the mouth of the river, possibly as a reaction to increasing water temperatures. Maximum growth rate was 1.4 mm.d-1 at about 26-degrees-C. The mean instantaneous mortality rate (z) was estimated at 0.03.d-1. Settling of S. plagiusa occurred from mid-May onwards. The mean abundance was 10.3 ind.10(-2) m-2 (max. 98.3). Newly settled juveniles were most abundant on muddy sediments in the shallow river areas. The maximum growth rate was 1.3 mm.d-1 at about 28-degrees-C. The mean instantaneous mortality rate (Z) decreased from 0.04.d-1 in April to 0.01.d-1 in August. At all sites the abundance of juveniles of this species decreased with increasing water depth. Predation experiments indicated that blue crabs (Callinectes similis and C. sapidus) and sea robins (Prionotus sp.) are potential predators on juvenile flatfish. The high abundances of juvenile flatfish indicate that the tidal creeks are an important nursery area. The correspondence between growth rates estimated from field data and those observed in the laboratory suggests that growth in the nursery is mainly related to water temperature and not food limited.					1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON FLATFISH ECOLOGY1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON FLATFISH ECOLOGY	NOV 19-23, 1990NOV 19-23, 1990	NETHERLANDS INST SEA RES; NETHERLANDS INST FISHERY INVESTIGAT; COMMODITY BOARD FISH & FISHERY PROD; ROYAL NETHERLANDS ACAD ARTS & SCINETHERLANDS INST SEA RES; NETHERLANDS INST FISHERY INVESTIGAT; COMMODITY BOARD FISH & FISHERY PROD; ROYAL NETHERLANDS ACAD ARTS & SCI	TEXEL, NETHERLANDSTEXEL, NETHERLANDS	59	0	0	0	51	0	59			0077-7579			WOS:A1991GB83600018

Cod Gadus morhua and climate change: processes, productivity and prediction								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				77	8			1899	1911		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02782.x				NOV 2010	2010	Environmental factors act on individual fishes directly and indirectly. The direct effects on rates and behaviour can be studied experimentally and in the field, particularly with the advent of ever smarter tags for tracking fishes and their environment. Indirect effects due to changes in food, predators, parasites and diseases are much more difficult to estimate and predict. Climate can affect all life-history stages through direct and indirect processes and although the consequences in terms of growth, survival and reproductive output can be monitored, it is often difficult to determine the causes. Investigation of cod Gadus morhua populations across the whole North Atlantic Ocean has shown large-scale patterns of change in productivity due to lower individual growth and condition, caused by large-scale climate forcing. If a population is being heavily exploited then a drop in productivity can push it into decline unless the level of fishing is reduced: the idea of a stable carrying capacity is a dangerous myth. Overexploitation can be avoided by keeping fishing mortality low and by monitoring and responding rapidly to changes in productivity. There are signs that this lesson has been learned and that G. morhua will continue to be a mainstay of the human diet.									23	0	0	0	21	0	23			0022-1112			WOS:000284321600011	21078097

Rearing temperature may affect juvenile mortality, growth and development rates, adult mortality rate, and/or population growth rate. Increased juvenile growth rate may affect the trade-off curve relating fecundity to development period, lowering it and making it less steep. Here we identify the overall effects of temperature on optimal adult size. Larger bodies are favoured by decreased juvenile mortality rate and decreased population growth rate (the sum of these is termed discounted juvenile mortality rate).2. The effects of the other variables depend on whether environmental heterogeneity is spatial or temporal. Under spatial heterogeneity larger adult bodies are favoured by increased juvenile growth rate but varying adult mortality rate has no effect. Under temporal heterogeneity larger adult bodies are favoured by increased adult mortality rate but the effects of juvenile growth rate depend on the details of the changes in the fecundity-development period trade-off curve.3. If discounted juvenile mortality rate does not increase at higher temperatures, some of these predictions are hard to reconcile with the finding that higher rearing temperatures generally result in smaller adult bodies. Using available data, we conclude that temperature effects on juvenile growth in spatially heterogeneous environments, and on adult mortality in temporally heterogeneous environments, would generally predict larger rather than smaller size.4. Predictions involving juvenile mortality and population growth rate are also evaluated using the available data, and mechanisms linking temperature to increased juvenile mortality are discussed. They include increased molecular damage, ectotherm predation and parasitism, drought and oxygen shortage.									168	1	0	0	161	2	173			0269-8463			WOS:A1994PA05600009

A 2-year study was carried out on the roles of nutrients and fish in determining the plankton communities of a shallow lake in north-west Spain. Outcomes were different each year depending on the initial conditions, especially of macrophyte biomass. In 1998 estimated initial 'per cent water volume inhabited' (PVI) by submerged macrophytes was about 35%. Phytoplankton biomass estimated as chlorophyll a was strongly controlled by fish, whereas effects of nutrient enrichment were not significant. In 1999 estimated PVI was 80%, no fish effect was observed on phytoplankton biomass, but nutrients had significant effects. Water temperatures were higher in 1998 than in 1999.2. In the 1998 experiment, cladoceran populations were controlled by fish and cyanobacteria were the dominant phytoplankton group. There were no differences between effects of low (4 g fresh mass m(-2)) and high (20 g fresh mass m(-2)) fish density on total zooplankton biomass, but zooplankton biomass was higher in the absence of fish. With the high plant density in 1999, fish failed to control any group of the zooplankton community.3. Total biovolume of phytoplankton strongly decreased with increased nutrient concentrations in 1998, although chlorophyll a concentrations did not significantly change. At higher nutrient concentrations, flagellate algae became more abundant with likely growth rates that could have overcompensated cladoceran feeding rates. This change in phytoplankton community composition may have been because of increases in the DIN : SRP ratio. Both chlorophyll a concentration and total phytoplankton biovolume increased significantly with nutrients in the 1999 experiment.4. A strong decline of submerged macrophytes was observed in both years as nutrients increased, resulting in shading by periphyton. This shading effect could account for the plant decline despite lower water turbidity at the very high nutrient levels in 1998.									26	0	0	0	25	0	26			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000225316100006		
J	Campbell, Emily Y.; Dunham, Jason B.; Reeves, Gordon H.								Linkages between temperature, macroinvertebrates, and young-of-year Coho Salmon growth in surface-water and groundwater streams								FRESHWATER SCIENCE				39	3			447	460		10.1086/710042				SEP 1 2020	2020	Ecological resources for fishes in stream food webs shift over space and time, providing a complex template of available resources that can be used for growth. We tracked water temperature in conjunction with young-of-year Coho Salmon size, growth, and diet in 2 streams with contrasting thermal regimes: a groundwater stream with colder temperatures and lower thermal variability all year and a surface-water stream with greater thermal variability and warmer summer temperatures more conducive to young-of-year salmon growth. We hypothesized that fry emergence would occur when rearing conditions are optimal for growth and that, all else being equal, summer fish growth will be greater in the surface-water stream. Previous work on Coho Salmon phenology in these streams showed that peak fry emergence occurred at the same time in early summer in both streams. We measured salmon fry emergence in relation to thermal variability and macroinvertebrate prey availability with subsequent tracking of somatic growth, diet, and body size during the 1(st)year of life in both streams. Macroinvertebrate prey availability was highest overall in the colder and thermally-stable groundwater stream than the surface-water stream. Prey availability was particularly high in the thalweg drift during peak fry emergence in the groundwater stream. There was no difference in Coho Salmon diet composition between streams, which included invertebrates from benthic, drift, and riparian habitats. We found no differences in young-of-year Coho Salmon body size, growth, or consumption between streams. Overall, our results suggest that large differences in thermal regimes do not necessarily translate to large differences in young-of-year Coho Salmon size, growth, or diet. Many variables can influence fish growth, and there is not always a direct connection between spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental variability and their cascading effects on young-of-year Coho Salmon growth during the 1(st)summer of life.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2161-9549	2161-9565		WOS:000563574700008

The endothermic salmon shark Lamna ditropis uses the California Current System (CCS) as a nursery area, though little is known about how juveniles use this ecosystem. Juvenile salmon sharks consistently strand along the west coast of North America. Strandings in the southern CCS occurred throughout the year, while those in the northern CCS were limited to summer and autumn, when mean sea surface temperatures were warmest. Strandings primarily occurred when water temperature was between 12 and 16 degrees C, suggesting that juveniles occupy a relatively narrow thermal niche. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) indicated that juveniles primarily feed on offshore meso-and epipelagic prey from the outer shelf, slope, and oceanic habitats as opposed to inshore and coastal habitats, although sharks appeared to move closer to shore prior to stranding. Generalized additive models indicate that the probability of stranding was greatest when mean water temperatures were relatively high (similar to 14 degrees C) and sharks were exposed to acute cold-water events (similar to 9 degrees C) during coastal upwelling. This suggests that juveniles are thermally limited and stressed by upwelling events, resulting in bacterial infections that are the proximate cause of the strandings.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000354393700017

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000466375600012

Using long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas stranded in New Zealand (2011) and Australia (2012), we investigated relationships between tooth growth chronologies, as a proxy for energy budgets (which underpin population state), and interannual variations in broad-scale climate indices (Southern Oscillation Index [SOI], Indian Ocean Dipole [IOD]) and spatially explicit, seasonally averaged sea surface temperature (SST). Tooth chronologies from pilot whales that stranded in Australia had a positive relationship with the SOI and a negative relationship with the IOD. Those from New Zealand had a positive relationship with the SOI, but at a 1 yr lag. Positive SOI and negative IOD conditions are associated with increased storm activity across the southern Australian/New Zealand region. The resulting changes in regional SST, currents and frontal activity likely influences the distribution of prey resources and associated high-order predators such as pilot whales. Correlation maps between tooth growth chronologies and SSTs suggest differences in habitat utilisation between the 2 regional groups, with pilot whales stranded in Australia associating with the subtropical and subantarctic fronts south of Tasmania, and those stranded in New Zealand associating with a number of regions of seasonally enhanced productivity close to New Zealand. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the environmental conditions influencing populations of an insufficiently studied species in the region.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000521168400014

However, the biotic and abiotic factors influencing this mortality component remain largely unexplored, leaving a gap in our understanding of the impacts of environmental change on ecological communities. We investigated the effects of temperature, prey density, and predator diversity and density on NCM in an aquatic food web module composed of dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea) and marbled crayfish (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis) preying on common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fry. We found that NCM increased with prey density and depended on the functional diversity and density of the predator community. Warming significantly reduced NCM only in the dragonfly larvae but the magnitude depended on dragonfly larvae density. Our results indicate that energy transfer across trophic levels is more efficient due to lower NCM in functionally diverse predator communities, at lower resource densities and at higher temperatures. This suggests that environmental changes such as climate warming and reduced resource availability could increase the efficiency of energy transfer in food webs only if functionally diverse predator communities are conserved.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			2045-2322			WOS:000418644100034	29273716

We investigated the combined effect of a heat wave and subsequent exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae. To assess local thermal adaptation to heat waves, we applied these combined stressors on replicated low- and high-latitude populations in Europe. Unexpectedly, we observed positive sublethal effects of the heat wave: fat content and phenoloxidase activity increased. Chlorpyrifos had strong negative effects on survival, growth rate, and fat content, while phenoloxidase activity increased; these effects between latitudes were found similar. We found little indication of a higher ability to withstand a heat wave in southern larvae. We did detect a synergistic negative effect on AChE activity. This result highlights the importance of considering delayed effects of extreme temperature events when assessing the impact of pesticides under climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The major objective for this work was to relate any changes in cod diet and amount of food eaten to seasonal variations in prey availability, water temperature and spawning at a spatial scale between broad-scale and laboratory studies. Results suggested that the type and amount of food eaten by cod was generally consistent throughout a year and repeatable across years. Cod feeding was marked by two periods of increased feeding, corresponding to the arrival of small pelagic fishes in the area. This pelagic migration and subsequent increased feeding by cod occurred during important periods in the life history of cod (e.g. spawning and overwintering). Similar annual patterns in food consumption and diet composition were remarkably consistent over the 2.5 years of the project, suggesting important feeding periods for cod that correspond to environmental and biological events. The diet of cod was composed primarily of several species of forage fishes [e.g. herrings (predominantly Atlantic herring Clupea harengus), sand lance Ammodytes sp. and Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus], ophiuroids, Cancer sp. crabs and other small crustaceans. It was inferred that cod exhibited a maintenance diet on local forage fishes and benthic macroinvertebrates, augmenting their diet by seasonally gorge feeding upon migrating pelagic species.Journal compilation (C) 2007 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

The relationship between the growth of S. niphonius larvae and concentration of major prey organisms of the larvae, clupeid larvae, was investigated in the Sea of Hiuchi, the central Seto Inland Sea, Japan, from 28 to 29 May 1997. Water temperature, salinity, and the concentration of clupeid larvae had no significant effect on the S. niphonius larval concentration. Mean growth rate of S. niphonius larvae varied between 0.38 and 0.64 mm day(-1). The temperature and salinity had no significant effect on the mean larval growth rate while there existed prey concentration-dependent growth at lower prey concentration. The relationship between the mean larval growth rate (G(m)) and concentration of clupeid larvae (C-C) was expressed by a logarithmic equation: G(m)=0.037 log C-C + 0.441 (n=16, r(2)=0.519, P<0.01).									12	2	0	0	12	0	14			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000223514200006

Their importance as prey appears to be related to (1) the seasonal timing of terrestrial inputs relative to the abundance of aquatic prey and (2) water temperature, which affects food demand by fish. Most studies of seasonal patterns of terrestrial inputs have come from temperate systems, and patterns in most other systems are unknown. We measured monthly biomass of aquatic invertebrates, input of terrestrial invertebrates, and diets of Oncorhynchus mykiss (non-anadromous and juvenile anadromous life history forms) for 15 months in two streams in a basin with a Mediterranean-type climate on the Big Sur coast of California. Biomass of aquatic invertebrates and terrestrial inputs followed a similar seasonal pattern; highest levels occurred in summer and early autumn and were highly correlated with water temperature. Total annual input of terrestrial invertebrates was 8.7 g(.)m(-2.)year(-1), and terrestrial inputs provided about half of the prey biomass and energy consumed by O. mykiss during the study. Normative terrestrial isopods, primarily Armadillidium vulgare, contributed 30-40% of the biomass and 20-30% of the energy consumed-the highest proportions among all taxa. The annual input, seasonal pattern, and contribution of terrestrial invertebrates to salmonids in this coastal Mediterranean-type basin were similar to published values from temperate forested streams. However, the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations of inputs was less pronounced than that in most temperate streams and appears to reflect the lower intra-annual temperature variation and longer leaf-out period in this system. Unlike many temperate streams, where terrestrial inputs provide an alternate prey source when aquatic invertebrate abundance is low, terrestrial inputs to these two coastal streams apparently provide a year-round additional source of prey that (like aquatic prey) peaks when water temperature is warmest and hence when fish growth potential is high.									22	0	0	0	24	0	24			0002-8487			WOS:000255322100009

Recent tracking studies revealed that they are actually deep divers, but there has been no evidence of foraging in deep water. Furthermore, the surfacing behaviour of ocean sunfish was thought to be related to behavioural thermoregulation, but there was no record of sunfish body temperature. Evidence of ocean sunfish feeding in deep water was obtained using a combination of an animal-borne accelerometer and camera with a light source. Siphonophores were the most abundant prey items captured by ocean sunfish and were typically located at a depth of 50-200m where the water temperature was <12 degrees C. Ocean sunfish were diurnally active, made frequently deep excursions and foraged mainly at 100-200m depths during the day. Ocean sunfish body temperatures were measured under natural conditions. The body temperatures decreased during deep excursions and recovered during subsequent surfacing periods. Heat-budget models indicated that the whole-body heat-transfer coefficient between sunfish and the surrounding water during warming was 3-7 times greater than that during cooling. These results suggest that the main function of surfacing is the recovery of body temperature, and the fish might be able to increase heat gain from the warm surface water by physiological regulation. The thermal environment of ocean sunfish foraging depths was lower than their thermal preference (c.16-17 degrees C). The behavioural and physiological thermoregulation enables the fish to increase foraging time in deep, cold water. Feeding rate during deep excursions was not related to duration or depth of the deep excursions. Cycles of deep foraging and surface warming were explained by a foraging strategy, to maximize foraging time with maintaining body temperature by vertical temperature environment.									59	0	0	0	55	0	59			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000353405300002	25643743

Reproductive strategy and recruitment dynamics of amphidromous goby Sicyopterus japonicus as revealed by otolith microstructure								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				73	10			2497	2512		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02102.x				DEC 2008	2008	The daily ages of 312 of 879 newly recruited postlarvae of Sicyopterus japonicus, collected from the Shuang-Chi Estuary in north-eastern Taiwan during February 1996 to April 1997, were determined from daily growth increments in their otoliths. Pelagic larval duration, growth rate of the marine larval stage and hatching dates were estimated, and recruitment timing was linked to environmental factors. The mean +/- s.d. total length (L-T) and daily ages of S. japonicus at recruitment to the estuary were estimated to be 33.95 +/- 1.31 mm (range 30.7 to 38.1, n = 317) and 163.72 +/- 12.79 days (range 130 to 198, n = 312), respectively. The recruitment of S. japonicus larvae is size dependent not age dependent because L-T of the larvae is independent of age at recruitment. Periodic analysis indicated that L-T and growth rate of the larvae were inversely correlated with the age at recruitment, which means that the fast-growing individuals recruited earlier. The growth rate of S. japonicus in the marine larval stage was synchronous with marine productivity in this subtropical area, i.e. the spring cohort recruited in the autumn had a higher growth rate than the autumn cohort recruited the following spring. The main spawning season of S. japonicus as backcalculated from otolith daily increments was in autumn, a relatively low productivity period compared with spring. During this season, there were fewer competitors and predators than in the more productive spring. The recruitment of 95% of postlarva coincided with low salinity (14) and low water temperature (23 degrees C) in the river mouth that provided a buffer area for the adaptation of the larvae for upstream migration. This unique reproduction strategy and prolonged larval duration facilitated the widespread distribution of the fish along the coasts of East Asia.									28	3	0	0	28	0	31			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000261786800016

The specific host-parasitoid life system used in the evaluation was the boil weevil-Catolaccus grandis system. Four forms of functional response equations were tested: Type I, Type II, a Type II modified to yield constant attack probabilities under constant host:parasitoid ratios, and a temperature-dependent Type II. Simulation runs showed that the parasitoid is potentially capable of considerable suppression of the host population. Predicted host numbers under Type I and II equations did not differ markedly, because realistic host numbers per parasitoid were often found in the linear portion of the Type II equation. The probability of attack using a Type I equation was always near 100% despite arbitrarily increasing the host population to create a wide range of host:parasitoid ratios. The Type II equation resulted in fluctuating attack probabilities which steadily declined as host:parasitoid ratio exceeded 100:1. The modified Type II equation yielded attack probabilities starting at 52% and steadily declining to about 8% when host:parasitoid ratios neared 1000:1. We introduced a realistic, but hypothetical, relationship between functional response and temperature. Simulations using actual weather data from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas suggest that there is little difference between using Types I or II equations, but that the effect of temperature on attack rates is substantial in this system. Caution should be used when incorporating data from experiments into simulation models because experimental conditions are often unrealistically optimal. We discuss the possible importance of temperature and other diurnal or environmental events on functional response and the value of relevant data in this and other simulation models of biological control.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:A1996UR21900005

In each pond, 1 m(2) cages were placed in vegetated and unvegetated habitats and growth rates of individually marked fish were measured in three 10 to 15 d experiments from 4 June to 7 July 1997. Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and benthic food were also measured. Stable isotopes of C and N were measured in experimental and wild fish. Growth rates were 0.06 to 0.76 mm d(-1) and decreased through the experiments. Growth rates of wild fish (0.19 mm d(-1) in Point Judith Pond and 0.21 in Ninigret Pond) were similar to the average of the 2nd and 3rd experiments (0.24 mm d(-1)). Growth rates were the same in vegetated and unvegetated sites. They were also the same in Point Judith and Ninigret ponds but lower in Green Hill Pond. An ANCOVA suggested that Green Hill's lower rates were caused by its higher temperatures, particularly during the 3rd experiment. Benthic food was similar in the different ponds, different habitat types, and in cores taken inside and outside cages. Categories of food consumed by fish were not affected by the presence of vegetation in a cage, although food consumed did differ from pond to pond. Amphipods were the preferred food in all ponds; fish consumed proportionately more amphipods and fewer polychaetes in Ninigret Pond than in the other ponds. Values of delta(15)N in the fish varied with the degree of development in the watershed but not with total nitrogen in the water column. The results of this study indicate that growth rates of fish can be used as indicators of habitat quality.									56	0	0	0	52	0	56			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000089013400025		
J	Witting, DA; Chambers, RC; Bosley, KL; Wainright, SC								Experimental evaluation of ontogenetic diet transitions in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), using stable isotopes as diet tracers								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				61	11			2069	2084		10.1139/F04-156				NOV 2004	2004	We examined the rate of isotopic change of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) and isotopic fractionation at two temperatures during several ontogenetic diet transitions in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus). We examined prefeeding larvae as they metabolize the maternal source of nutrition and evaluated three diet transitions in the early life stages of this species: (i) yolk dependency to first feeding on zooplankton, (ii) one zooplankton (rotifers) to another (Artemia), and (iii) zooplanktivory to piscivory. We used experimental results and simulations to contrast time- versus growth-based models for estimating parameters of isotopic change and fractionation. All rates of isotopic change were lowest for the transition between zooplanktivory and piscivory, most rapid for the transition from yolk dependency to first feeding, and generally lower at cooler temperatures. Estimates of fractionation were greater for N (2.8e-3.8e) than for C (0.23e-0.91e) but appeared to be unaffected by water temperature or fish life stage. Simulation results suggested that parameter estimates of isotopic change and fractionation may be compromised when growth rates are low unless sampling design is modified to address slow growth rates. We conclude that sampling strategy and the model used can influence the accuracy and precision of estimates of isotopic change and fractionation.									34	1	0	0	32	0	35			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000227073300004		
J	Liao, HS; Pierce, CL; Larscheid, JG								Consumption dynamics of the adult piscivorous fish community in Spirit Lake, Iowa								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				24	3			890	902		10.1577/M02-178.1				AUG 2004	2004	At Spirit Lake, one of Iowa's most important fisheries, walleye Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum) is one of the most popular species with anglers. Despite a century of walleye stocking and management in Spirit Lake, walleye growth rate, size structure, and angler harvest continue to decline. Our purpose was to determine the magnitude and dynamics of walleye population consumption relative to those of other piscivorous species in Spirit Lake, which would allow managers to judge the feasibility of increasing the abundance, growth rate, and size structure of the walleye population. We quantified food consumption by the adult piscivorous fish community in Spirit Lake over a 3-year period. Data on population dynamics, diet, energy density, and water temperature from 1995 to 1997 were used in bioenergetics models to estimate total consumption by walleye, yellow perch Perca flavescens, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, and northern pike Esox lucius. Estimated annual consumption by the piscivorous community varied roughly fourfold, ranging from 154,752 kg in 1995 to 662,776 kg in 1997. Walleyes dominated total consumption, accounting for 68, 73, and 90% (1995-1997, respectively) of total food consumption. Walleyes were'also the dominant consumers of fish, accounting for 76, 86, and 97% of piscivorous consumption; yellow perch followed, accounting for 16% of piscivorous consumption in 1995 and 12% in 1996. Yellow perch were the predominant fish prey species in all 3 years, accounting for 68, 52, and 36% of the total prey consumed. Natural reproduction is weak, so high walleye densities are maintained by intensive stocking. Walleye stocking drives piscivorous consumption in Spirit Lake, and yearly variation in the cannibalism of stocked walleye fry may be an important determinant of walleye year-class strength and angler success. Reducing walleye stocking intensity, varying stocking intensity from year to year, and attempting to match stocking intensity with the abundance of prey species other than walleye may improve the walleye fishery in Spirit Lake.									18	0	0	0	18	0	18			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000223531200013

J	Ruggerone, GT; Nielsen, JL								Evidence for competitive dominance of Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) over other Salmonids in the North Pacific Ocean								REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES				14	3			371	390		10.1007/s11160-004-6927-0				SEP 2004	2004	Relatively little is known about fish species interactions in offshore areas of the worlds' oceans because adequate experimental controls are typically unavailable in such vast areas. However, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are numerous and have an alternating-year pattern of abundance that provides a natural experimental control to test for interspecific competition in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Since a number of studies have recently examined pink salmon interactions with other salmon, we reviewed them in an effort to describe patterns of interaction over broad regions of the ocean. Research consistently indicated that pink salmon significantly altered prey abundance of other salmon species (e.g., zooplankton, squid), leading to altered diet, reduced total prey consumption and growth, delayed maturation, and reduced survival, depending on species and locale. Reduced survival was observed in chum salmon (O. keta) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) originating from Puget Sound and in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Growth of pink salmon was not measurably affected by other salmon species, but their growth was sometimes inversely related to their own abundance. In all marine studies, pink salmon affected other species through exploitation of prey resources rather than interference. Interspecific competition was observed in nearshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, and one study documented competition between species originating from different continents. Climate change had variable effects on competition. In the North Pacific Ocean, competition was observed before and after the ocean regime shift in 1977 that significantly altered abundances of many marine species, whereas a study in the Pacific Northwest reported a shift from predation- to competition-based mortality in response to the 1982/1983 El Nino. Key traits of pink salmon that influenced competition with other salmonids included great abundance, high consumption rates and rapid growth, degree of diet overlap or consumption of lower trophic level prey, and early migration timing into the ocean. The consistent pattern of findings from multiple regions of the ocean provides evidence that interspecific competition can significantly influence salmon population dynamics and that pink salmon may be the dominant competitor among salmon in marine waters.

Effects of rapid experimental temperature increases on acute physiological stress and behaviour of stream dwelling juvenile chinook salmon								JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY				31	5			429	441		10.1016/j.jtherbio.2006.02.003				JUL 2006	2006	We experimentally heated small streams in summer and investigated the short-term behavioural changes and physiological stress responses of juvenile chinook salmon (Oneorhynchus tshawytscha). We rapidly raised temperatures similar to 1-4 degrees C for 1.5 h above ambient levels of similar to 7-15 degrees C in groundwater fed tributary streams and similar to 19-23 degrees C in side-channel streams. Juvenile chinook rearing in groundwater fed tributaries were generally unaffected behaviourally; however, we found that temperature increase caused fish in the tributary trials to be physiologically stressed (elevations in mean cortisol concentrations ranged from 116% to 253%). Side-channel trials caused some mortality of juvenile chinook and a stronger display of behaviours indicative of stress and avoidance such as erratic swimming, abnormal posture, and aggregative behaviour. Foraging rates increased over 56 times in response to heating in side-channel trials. Cortisol levels did not increase in side-channel trials, but rather showed a trend to levels below control values suggesting an impaired stress response possibly due to chronic stress. Our results may reflect conservative responses in terms of what we may find with other salmonid species since juvenile chinook have been described as the most tolerant of the Pacific salmon species to elevated temperatures.

In the offshore (> 20 m deep) waters of eastern Lake Erie, burbot Lota lota is a native top predator, feeding on a suite of prey fishes. The round goby invaded eastern Lake Erie during the late 1990s, and round goby population size increased dramatically during 1999-2004. According to annual bottom trawl survey results, round goby abundance in offshore waters peaked in 2004, but then declined during 2004-2008. Coincidentally, round goby became an important component of burbot diet beginning in 2003. Using bottom trawling and gill netting, we estimated adult burbot abundance and age structure in eastern Lake Erie during 2007. Diet composition and energy density of eastern Lake Erie burbot were also determined during 2007. This information, along with estimates of burbot growth, burbot mortality, burbot water temperature regime, and energy densities of prey fish from the literature, were incorporated into a bioenergetics model application to estimate annual consumption of round goby by the adult burbot population. Results indicated that the adult burbot population in eastern Lake Erie annually consumed 1,361 metric tons of round goby. Based on the results of bottom trawling, we estimated the biomass of yearling and older round goby in offshore waters eastern Lake Erie during 2007-2008 to be 2,232 metric tons. Thus, the adult burbot population was feeding on round goby at an annual rate equal to 61% of the estimated round goby standing stock. We concluded that the burbot population had high potential to exert predatory control on round goby in offshore waters of eastern Lake Erie.									41	0	0	0	37	0	41			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000288448400016

Growth-trajectories in larval and juvenile stages were back-calculated by otolith microstructure analysis using juveniles collected in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region of the western North Pacific in May and June from 2002 to 2011. A total of 532 otoliths were analysed. Hatch dates were distributed from mid-March to mid-May and most chub mackerel hatched in April. Mean daily growth rates +/- A standard deviation (SD) of the April cohort in larval and juvenile stages ranged between 1.03 +/- 0.10 (2006) and 1.52 +/- 0.23 mm day(-1) (2009). The mean daily growth rate and larval stage duration were significantly related to recruitment which had been estimated by virtual population analysis. The results indicated the growth rate of the April cohort was an important index of year-class strength. There was a significant correlation between sea surface temperature experienced by each fish and the mean daily growth rate during the larval period. Higher water temperature led to faster growth and shorter larval stage duration of the April cohort of the Pacific stock of chub mackerel.									16	2	0	0	13	0	18			0919-9268	1444-2906		WOS:000354194100010

Herein, we examined the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on both prey and predator by letting one predatory reef fish interact for 24 h with eight small or large juvenile damselfishes from four congeneric species. Both prey and predator were exposed to control or elevated levels of CO2. Mortality rate and predator selectivity were compared across CO2 treatments, prey size and species. Small juveniles of all species sustained greater mortality at high CO2 levels, while large recruits were not affected. For large prey, the pattern of prey selectivity by predators was reversed under elevated CO2. Our results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative consumptive effects of CO2 on small and larger damselfish recruits respectively, resulting from CO2-induced behavioural changes likely mediated by impaired neurological function. This study highlights the complexity of predicting the effects of climate change on coral reef ecosystems.									126	3	0	0	108	0	129			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000296263200009	21936880

Seasonal variation in the invertebrate community and diet of a top fish predator in a thermally stable spring								HYDROBIOLOGIA											10.1007/s10750-020-04409-5		SEP 2020			2020	Many life-history events in aquatic invertebrates are triggered by seasonal changes in water temperature, but other ecological factors may be important as well. To rule out the confounding effects of changing water temperature, we studied the seasonal dynamics of an aquatic invertebrate community and their effect on a top fish predator in a thermally stable freshwater spring in South Iceland. We sampled benthic invertebrates five times over a year and conducted a mark-recapture study on the top predator in the system, small benthic Arctic charr,Salvelinus alpinus(L.). We assessed variation in diet composition and feeding preferences by calculating the electivity and individual specialisation of each fish at each sampling time. There was a clear separation of winter and summer communities for the benthic invertebrates. The variation in prey availability was also reflected in the fish diet, with higher feeding selectivity in summer than in winter for the highly abundant Chironomidae larvae. In contrast, individual specialisation as a measure of intrapopulation niche variation was higher in winter when prey availability was lower. We furthermore found that groundwater amphipods might play an important role in the winter diet of spring-dwelling Arctic charr. In conclusion, seasonal variation in the invertebrate community is an important factor to consider and has the potential to alter the phenotype (e.g. growth rates) and behaviour (e.g. feeding preferences) of higher trophic levels.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000570480200001

In contrast, delta N-15 values of bluegill increased with increasing latitude. Better digestive performance of the fish at higher latitudes was assumed to explain this result, whereas the discharge from a sewage treatment plant seemed to have a more direct impact on the extremely high delta N-15 values of bluegill at the highest latitude site. Length-weight relationships were used to assess the changes in the body weight of fish with a normalized body size. Bluegill at higher latitudes exhibited greater body weights with a prolonged duration of body weight gain. Bluegill at lower latitudes may have adapted to grow rapidly from late spring to early summer when feeding activity increases in response to increasing water temperature, while the catabolic activity remains at a low level. In contrast, bluegill at higher latitudes can continue to grow until the midsummer months owing to the lower water temperature. The seasonal growth pattern of bluegill was analyzed using a logistic-type equation. The assumption that the selection of growth rate or final body size depends on temperature may reasonably explain the latitudinal variation in the growth pattern of bluegill in Lake Biwa.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0003-455X	1797-2450		WOS:000303355600004

Three kinds of predation were simulated: epibenthic egg predators consuming eggs on the substrate surface during spawning, interstitial egg predators that can move in rocky substrate and consume incubating eggs, and fry predators. Also simulated was the effect of water temperature on predation rates. The model predicted that interstitial predation on eggs accounted for most (76 to 81%) of the predation on early life history stages of lake trout; epibenthic egg predation (12 to 19%) and fry predation (0 to 12%) had less effect on lake trout survival. Initial predation conditions chosen for the model were: epibenthic egg predation peaked at 2 eggs/m(2)/d over 30 d, interstitial egg predation at 2 eggs/m(2)/d over 180 d, and fry predation at 1 fry/m(2)/d over 60 d. With a starting egg density of 100 eggs/m(2) and initial predation conditions, no lake trout were estimated to survive to swim-up. At egg densities of 250 eggs/m(2), 36% of the lake trout survived. At the highest egg densities examined 500 to 1,000 eggs/m(2), estimated survival increased to about 70 to 80%. Simulated survival rates of lake trout decreased dramatically as predation rate increased but were not as sensitive to increases in the duration of predation.									23	0	0	0	23	0	24			0380-1330			WOS:000079811600004

Conditions in the fluid environment (e.g. flow, temperature) can influence both the flux of particles past an organism and the efficiency with which organisms retain those particles. We investigated feeding behavior in the barnacle Balanus glandula under a range of water velocities and temperatures using gut dissections to directly quantify capture rates of food particles. Overall, the percentage of barnacles observed beating was typically high (68 +/- 3%), yet gut dissections confirmed that a far lower percentage had actually ingested food particles (hydrated Artemia cysts; 22 +/- 3%). This discrepancy suggests that cirral activity may serve other functions and that simple behavioral descriptions provide a poor proxy for barnacle feeding rate. Although the delivery of cysts to the cirral net and cyst capture rates peaked at intermediate water velocities (7.5 to 20 cm s(-1)), capture efficiency (the ratio of cysts captured to cysts encountered) was highest under the slowest flow (1 cm s(-1)). Model analysis demonstrated that detailed characterization of cirral beating behavior is required to accurately predict patterns of flow-dependent cyst capture. Barnacles also showed a clear thermal optimum between 10 and 15 degrees C in both capture rate and efficiency. At high temperatures (25 degrees C), feeding was reduced due to an increase in abbreviated beating behavior, whereas at low temperatures (5 degrees C) reduced capture was likely a consequence of slower beating rate. Again, only when beating behavior was incorporated into models were patterns of temperature-dependent cyst capture accurately predicted. These results suggest that the limits to feeding success are not simply biophysical, but also behavioral in nature.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000340982100016

In this study, we modified the model of Bourles et al. (2009) developed for the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to improve the description of reproductive effort The model was amended in two ways: a new set of parameters was incorporated and a full description of gonad construction in spring was added, with a new state variable. The application of this model to a dataset for oyster growth measured in four bays over two years showed that this model better described reproductive effort, without modifying overall growth dynamics. We then explored the reproductive responses of oysters to their environment in greater detail, by applying this new version of the model with the theoretical forcing variables of phytoplankton concentration and temperature. Spawning time was found to be driving principally by yearly mean temperature, and reproductive effort was found to depend mostly on the half-saturation coefficient of the functional response. These results highlight the importance of the half-saturation coefficient and provide additional support for field research on the food preferences of oysters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have experimentally demonstrated the effects of warming on communities simultaneously at different locales. We manipulated air temperature with in situ passive warming and cooling chambers and quantified effects of temperature on ant abundance, diversity, and foraging activities (predation, scavenging, seed dispersal, nectivory, granivory) in two deciduous forests at 35 degrees and 43 degrees N latitude in the eastern U.S. In the southern site, the most abundant species, Crematogaster lineolata, increased while species evenness, most ant foraging activities, and abundance of several other ant species declined with increasing temperature. In the northern site, species evenness was highest at intermediate temperatures, but no other metrics of diversity or foraging activity changed with temperature. Regardless of temperature, ant abundance and foraging activities at the northern site were several orders of magnitude lower than those in the southern site.									28	0	0	0	28	0	28			2150-8925			WOS:000208810600010

As a consequence, elevated CO2 is expected to alter the earths' climate, increase global temperatures and change weather patterns. This is likely to have both direct and indirect impacts on plants, insect pests, plant pathogens and their distribution, and is therefore problematic for the security of future food production. This review summarizes the latest findings and highlights current knowledge gaps regarding the influence of climate change on insect, plant and pathogen interactions with an emphasis on agriculture and food production. Direct effects of climate change, including increased CO2 concentration, temperature, patterns of rainfall and severe weather events that impact insects (namely vectors of plant pathogens) are discussed. Elevated CO2 and temperature, together with plant pathogen infection, can considerably change plant biochemistry and therefore plant defense responses. This can have substantial consequences on insect fecundity, feeding rates, survival, population size, and dispersal. Generally, changes in host plant quality due to elevated CO2 (e.g., carbon to nitrogen ratios in C3 plants) negatively affect insect pests. However, compensatory feeding, increased population size and distribution have also been reported for some agricultural insect pests. This underlines the importance of additional research on more targeted, individual insect-plant scenarios at specific locations to fully understand the impact of a changing climate on insect-plant-pathogen interactions.									21	3	0	0	16	0	22			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000423298700006

Effects of temperature and prey size on predator-prey interactions between bluefish and bay anchovy								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				461				449	457		10.1016/j.jembe.2014.08.023				DEC 2014	2014	Little is known about the behavioral responses of fishes at low temperatures. Of particular interest are predator-prey interactions because feeding at low temperature is necessary for the overwinter survival of many species. This experiment examined how low temperatures affect behavioral interactions between bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix L) and two sizes of bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli V.) prey. Temperature had an effect on multiple responses of predator-prey encounters including the approach distance of bluefish towards prey, attack and escape speeds, and prey handling time. The reaction distance of prey was important in determining the outcome of an attack; anchovy reacting at a greater distance from an attacking bluefish escaped more often. However, temperature did not have an effect on either reaction distance or bluefish capture success. The influence of prey size depended on how capture success was defined. Bluefish ability at catching prey was not affected by anchovy size, but larger prey were ingested less frequently due to a greater incidence of prey being dropped in trials with large anchovy. Further, bluefish had greater difficulty handling and ingesting prey at lower temperatures, especially for larger prey. At the lowest temperature treatment small anchovy were readily consumed, but no attacks were made on larger prey. This shows that bluefish modify prey size-selectivity behavior based on temperature, which probably results from a perceived inability to handle and ingest large prey at low temperatures. These results suggest that at low winter temperatures bluefish are restricted to smaller prey. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Species interactions and a chain of indirect effects driven by reduced precipitation								ECOLOGY				95	2			486	494		10.1890/13-0044.1				FEB 2014	2014	Climate change can affect species directly and indirectly by altering interactions between species within communities. These indirect effects can ramify through a community and affect many species, including some that may not have been directly affected by the perturbation. Identifying these chains of indirect effects is difficult, and most studies only follow indirect effects across two or three species. Here, we use a factorial field experiment to demonstrate that precipitation affects spotted aphids through a complex chain of indirect interactions that are mediated by other herbivores and a generalist predator. We experimentally simulated drought, which reduced water content in alfalfa plants. While water stress in alfalfa had no direct effect on spotted aphids, it lowered the population growth rate of pea aphids, another common alfalfa pest. Because ladybeetle predators were attracted to high pea aphid densities, predator densities were lower in drought treatments. Consequently, spotted aphid densities were released from top-down control (apparent competition) in drought treatments and reached densities three times higher than spotted aphids in ambient treatments with high pea aphid densities. Thus, drought affected spotted aphids in the interaction chain: drought alfalfa pea aphids predators spotted aphids. This result illustrates the lengthy path that indirect effects of climate change may take through a community, as well as the importance of community-level experiments in determining the net effect of climate change.									32	2	0	0	31	0	33			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000331429500022	24669741

A key challenge for ecologists is to predict how single and joint effects of global warming and predation risk translate from the individual level up to ecosystem functions. Recently, stoichiometric theory linked these levels through changes in body stoichiometry, predicting that both higher temperatures and predation risk induce shifts in energy storage (increases in C-rich carbohydrates and reductions in N-rich proteins) and body stoichiometry (increases in C : N and C : P). This promising theory, however, is rarely tested and assumes that prey will divert energy away from reproduction under predation risk, while under size-selective predation, prey instead increase fecundity.2. We exposed the water flea Daphnia magna to 4 degrees C warming and fish predation risk to test whether C-rich carbohydrates increase and N-rich proteins decrease, and as a result, C : N and C : P increase under warming and predation risk.3. Unexpectedly, warming decreased body C : N, which was driven by reductions in C-rich fat and sugar contents while the protein content did not change. This reflected a trade-off where the accelerated intrinsic growth rate under warming occurred at the cost of a reduced energy storage. Warming reduced C : N less and only increased C : P and N : P in the fishperiod Daphnia. These evolved stoichiometric responses to warming were largely driven by stronger warming-induced reductions in P than in C and N and could be explained by the better ability to deal with warming in the fish-period Daphnia.4. In contrast to theory predictions, body C : N decreased under predation risk due to a strong increase in the N-rich protein content that offsets the increase in C-rich fat content. The higher investment in fecundity (more N-rich eggs) under predation risk contributed to this stronger increase in protein content. Similarly, the lower body C : N of pre-fish Daphnia also matched their higher fecundity.5. Warming and predation risk independently shaped body stoichiometry, largely by changing levels of energy storage molecules. Our results highlight that two widespread patterns, the trade-off between rapid development and energy storage and the increased investment in reproduction under size-selective predation, cause predictable deviations from current ecological stoichiometry theory.									21	1	0	0	20	0	22			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000388354200003	27080908

We designed a novel rig configuration in artificial lure fishing for top predators and examined its effectiveness in angling for Baltic northern pike (Esox lucius) using a citizen science approach based on observational data collected from volunteer anglers in the field. The novel rig included two changes to traditional rig designs common to artificial lure angling. First, hooks were mounted in a way giving better hook exposure and eliminating lever-arm effects from the lure to the hooks once a fish is hooked. This construction allowed the second change, being a shift to hooks 4-5 sizes smaller than those used on traditional hook mounts. We analysed observational data collected by volunteer anglers using either the novel rig or a standard rig mount in two types of artificial lures (softbait and hardbait) of the same size (about 17 cm). Using N = 768 pike contacts as input data, we showed the landing rates of pike targeted with artificial lures significantly and substantially increased from 45% with normal-rigs to 85% when the same lure types were fished with the novel rig configuration. Lure type and water temperature had no effects on landing rates. Moreover, hardbaits on normal-rigs produced significantly more injury, bleeding and elevated unhooking time compared to fish captured on hardbaits with release-rigs. We conclude that simple changes to traditional hook sizes and mounts in lure fishing may benefit both anglers and the fishes that are to be released and that citizen science projects with volunteer anglers are able to provide good data in proof-of-concept studies. Further experimental studies are needed to differentiate hook size from hook mount effects because both variables were confounded in the results of the observational data presented here.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000432631000003	29785344

The results of 16 GER experiments designed to determine the effects of body size, prey type, and temperature on the GER in young-of-the-year (age-0) bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix are presented. The linear, square-root, and exponential GER models similarly fit the data. Temperature had a highly significant effect on age-0 bluefish GER. However, there was no significant difference in GER between small (5.14 g wet weight) and large (35.99 g wet weight) age-0 bluefish. Among the three different prey types tested (age-0 striped bass Morone saxatilis, bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, and age-0 Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus) there was no significant difference in GER. The exponential relation between bluefish GER and temperature can be used in estimating age-0 bluefish consumption rates in the field.									16	2	0	0	16	0	19			0002-8487			WOS:A1996UX35600010

As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.									21	0	0	0	17	0	21			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000457652200005

Phenological mismatch in Arctic-breeding shorebirds: Impact of snowmelt and unpredictable weather conditions on food availability and chick growth								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				9	11			6693	6707		10.1002/ece3.5248				JUN 2019	2019	The ecological consequences of climate change have been recognized in numerous species, with perhaps phenology being the most well-documented change. Phenological changes may have negative consequences when organisms within different trophic levels respond to environmental changes at different rates, potentially leading to phenological mismatches between predators and their prey. This may be especially apparent in the Arctic, which has been affected more by climate change than other regions, resulting in earlier, warmer, and longer summers. During a 7-year study near Utqiavik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, we estimated phenological mismatch in relation to food availability and chick growth in a community of Arctic-breeding shorebirds experiencing advancement of environmental conditions (i.e., snowmelt). Our results indicate that Arctic-breeding shorebirds have experienced increased phenological mismatch with earlier snowmelt conditions. However, the degree of phenological mismatch was not a good predictor of food availability, as weather conditions after snowmelt made invertebrate availability highly unpredictable. As a result, the food available to shorebird chicks that were 2-10 days old was highly variable among years (ranging from 6.2 to 28.8 mg trap(-1) day(-1) among years in eight species), and was often inadequate for average growth (only 20%-54% of Dunlin and Pectoral Sandpiper broods on average had adequate food across a 4-year period). Although weather conditions vary among years, shorebirds that nested earlier in relation to snowmelt generally had more food available during brood rearing, and thus, greater chick growth rates. Despite the strong selective pressure to nest early, advancement of nesting is likely limited by the amount of plasticity in the start and progression of migration. Therefore, long-term climatic changes resulting in earlier snowmelt have the potential to greatly affect shorebird populations, especially if shorebirds are unable to advance nest initiation sufficiently to keep pace with seasonal advancement of their invertebrate prey.									6	0	0	0	5	0	7			2045-7758			WOS:000472622400045	31236253

While it is well established that habitat disturbances can affect the composition and diversity of aquatic communities, only recently have studies considered whether such impacts result in changes in species' functional traits. We consider how functional traits of freshwater and marine fishes respond to environmental change, and how shifts in the expression of these traits can impact community dynamics and key ecological processes, including trophic interactions and nutrient transfer. We find that a multitude of functional traits, including behavioural and sensory traits, is sensitive to habitat disturbances. We demonstrate how these trait changes can be used to reveal hidden ecological diversity as well as serving as early indicators of environmental perturbation. We conclude that management strategies that consider the fundamental biological responses of fishes to habitat disturbance will be particularly effective in determining causal relationships within the ecological network. While detailed information on trait function is often lacking, even some general understanding of trait function and importance will facilitate targeted and efficient ecosystem management. We urge fisheries biologists and aquatic ecosystem managers to consider the role of functional traits in facilitating effective habitat restoration and management.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			1467-2960	1467-2979		WOS:000437113100009

Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate: (1) the evolutionary origin of the migratory behaviour of the Turdus thrushes in a biogeographic context including (2) trans-Atlantic dispersal events, (3) possible colonization routes into the Nearctic, and (4) relationships among life history traits, ecological factors, and migratory strategies within the most comprehensive taxon set of 72 Turdus thrushes to date. We estimated the ancestral ranges of the studied species, primarily by comparing main biogeographic models (dispersal-vicariance, dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis, BayArea models), and performed phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses to identify relationships among distribution patterns, diet, body measurements, clutch size, and migratory behaviour. We found that the most probable ancestral regions for all Turdus species were located in the East Palearctic realm, followed by early colonization of the western Palearctic and Africa, and that several trans-Atlantic movements occurred between 11 and 4 million years ago, which is earlier than previously thought. Migration emerged as an ancestral behaviour of the genus Turdus, and differences in clutch size and main food types were significant between migratory and non-migratory species. Correlated evolution was found between migration and along-latitudinal mobility, main food type, and the shift in main food type between the seasons. We conclude that along-latitudinal movements may have evolved earlier, simultaneously with the radiation of the Turdus thrushes, followed by the appearance of meridional migration, associated with orographic and climatic changes. The increased clutch sizes observed in migratory species and documented here for thrushes could serve as an important mechanism to compensate for losses due to mortality during migration.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			2193-7192	2193-7206		WOS:000468531300022		
J	Maier, Gerhard; Kley, Axel; Schank, Yasmin; Maier, Monika; Mayer, Gerd; Waloszek, Dieter								Density and temperature dependent feeding rates in an established and an alien freshwater gammarid fed on chironomid larvae								JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY				70	1			123	128		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.123				2011	2011	We compared feeding rates of the well-established, non-invasive amphipod Gammarus roeselii with those of the invasive Dikerogammarus villosus at different prey densities and different temperatures in laboratoty experiments using chironomid larvae as prey. Feeding rates were very variable in both species but higher in the invader species than in the well-established non-invasive species. These results were age independent. At high temperature (18-20 degrees C) and high prey density (>= 1000 prey m(-2)) one large adult D. villosus consumed 6-9 prey day(-1) on average while one G. roeselii consumed 4-7 prey d(-1) and one smaller D. villosus of a length of 8-10 mm consumed 2-5 prey d(-1) while one G. roeselii of the same length consumed 3 prey. Predation rate decreased considerably from high (18-20 degrees C) to low temperature (3 +/- 2 degrees C), from 9 to 4 prey predator(-1) d(-1) in D. villosus and from 7.5 to 2.5 prey predator(-1) d(-1) in G. roeselii. We conclude that both gammarids consumed a biomass in the range of 1/2 to 1/3 to their own biomass and that low predation/feeding rate at low temperature could be a reason why, in some places, indigenous gammarids can re-colonize their former habitats for a short period of time in cold winter and early spring in spite of the presence of the invasive. We further conclude that differences in weight between the species in particular in the experiments with adults can have influenced feeding rates; possibly differences in weight- specific feeding rates are small.									11	0	0	0	12	0	13			1129-5767	1723-8633		WOS:000294320300014		
J	Stevens, Bradley G.								Feeding rate of juvenile red king crabs, Paralithodes camtschaticus, in the laboratory: effects of temperature, size, molting, and feeding frequency								POLAR BIOLOGY				35	12			1791	1799		10.1007/s00300-012-1221-4				DEC 2012	2012	Despite the importance of food intake, feed ration has not been determined for many crabs. Juvenile red king crabs of mean size 25-30 mm carapace length (CL) were fed to satiation with squid either once or twice weekly for 6 months. Feed ration (FR = consumption expressed as a proportion of wet body mass) increased to a peak of about 0.10 at 30 days premolt, dropped to 0.03 during molting, then increased to about 0.08 at 14 days postmolt. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects modeling with repeated measures. There was no significant effect of feeding frequency on FR, and no significant interaction between frequency and CL. There was a significant negative relationship between FR and CL, a significant positive relationship between FR and temperature, and a minor but significant interaction between CL and temperature. The FR for juvenile red king crabs is about half that of the ration previously reported for adult crabs. Daily feed ration is a valuable physiological index that can be used to understand the impacts of predators such as king crabs on benthic biomass in boreal ecosystems, and to determine feeding regimes for aquaculture and stock enhancement. The relationships determined by this study can be used to predict daily ration for king crabs under specific temperature conditions, and how this may vary with climate change.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0722-4060			WOS:000310992200002		
J	LANKFORD, TE; TARGETT, TE								SUITABILITY OF ESTUARINE NURSERY ZONES FOR JUVENILE WEAKFISH (CYNOSCION REGALIS) - EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY ON FEEDING, GROWTH AND SURVIVAL								MARINE BIOLOGY				119	4			611	620		10.1007/BF00354325				JUL 1994	1994	Juvenile weakfish, Cynoscion regalis (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), exhibit significant spatial differences in growth rate and condition factor among estuarine nursery zones in Delaware Bay. The potential influence of temperature and salinity on the suitability of estuarine nursery areas for juvenile weakfish was investigated in laboratory experiments by measuring ad libitum feeding rate, growth rate and gross growth efficiency of juveniles collected in Delaware Bay in 1990 (40 to 50 mm standard length; 1.4 to 2.1 g) in 12 temperature/salinity treatments (temperatures: 20, 24, 28 degrees C; salinities: 5, 12, 19, 26 ppt) representing conditions encountered in different estuarine zones during spring/summer. Feeding rates (FR) increased significantly with temperature at all salinities, ranging from 10 to 15% body wt d(-1) at 20 degrees C to 33-39% body wt d(-1) at 28 degrees C. Specific growth rates (SGR) ranged from 1.4 to 9.4% body wt d(-1) (0.3 to 1.5 mm d(-1)) and gross growth efficiencies (K-1) varied from 13.6 to 26.4% across temperature/salinity combinations. Based on nonlinear multiple regression models, predicted optimal temperatures for SGR and K-1 were 29 and 27 degrees C, respectively. Salinity effects on SGR and K-1 were significant at 24 and 28 degrees C where predieted optimal salinity was 20 ppt. At these warmer temperatures, SGR and K-1 were significantly lower at 5 than at 19 ppt despite higher FR at 5 ppt. Therefore, maximum growth rate and growth efficiency occurred under conditions characteristic of mesohaline nurseries. This finding is consistent with spatial patterns of growth in Delaware Bay, implying that physicochemical gradients influence the value of particular estuarine zones as nurseries for juvenile weakfish by affecting the energetics of feeding and growth. Laboratory results indicate a seasonal shift in the location of physiologically optimal nurseries within estuaries. During late spring/early summer, warmer temperatures in oligohaline areas permit higher feeding rate and faster growth compared to mesohaline areas. By mid-late summer, spatial temperature gradients diminish and mesohaline areas provide more suitable physicochemical conditions for growth rate and growth efficiency whereas oligohaline areas become energetically stressful. Substantial mortality occurred at 5 ppt and 28 degrees C, providing additional evidence that oligohaline conditions are stressful during late summer. Furthermore, juveniles provided a choice among salinities in laboratory trials preferred those salinities which promoted higher growth rates. The extensive use of oligohaline nurseries by juvenile weakfish despite the potential for reduced growth rate and growth efficiency suggests this estuarine zone may provide a substantial refuge from predation.									94	1	0	0	92	0	97			0025-3162			WOS:A1994PA54000016

The focus was on pico- and nanoplankton feeding efficiencies, using 6-h incubations. Although healthy M. digitata consumed from 72% to 87% more pico-nanoplankton cells than P. lutea, feeding rates of bleached corals of both species were similarly low at heat stress (33 degrees C). Heterotrophic carbon acquisition with respect to dark respiration varied from 3% to 65% in M. digitata and from 7% to 68% in P. lutea. A decrease in the feeding efficiency of bleached M. digitata under heat stress shows its vulnerability to water heating events. Feeding rates of P. lutea were low under all conditions and treatments; therefore, this species is less vulnerable to heat stress due to the strategy of meeting metabolic costs by using translocated organic matter from endoliths and selecting pico-nanoplankton cells with a high C/N ratio.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-326X	1879-3363		WOS:000555500000045	32753190

In this study, T. pyri nymphs killed fewer prey than did T. pyri in other studies where the predators were reared on artificial substrates such as gelatin capsules. Nymphs showed a type II functional response to prey density: as prey density increased, kills increased at a decreasing rate to a plateau of three to four prey per day. Maximum rates of kill were a quadratic function of temperature over the range 18-26-degrees-C. There were significant differences between the sexes in feeding rates but not in rates of development. Rates of development of eggs and larvae and from egg to adult were an exponential function of temperature. Nymphs that ate less than one prey per day had reduced rates of development and survival. Individuals not given any prey survived only a few days as protonymphs. The susceptibility of nymphs to food shortages emphasizes the importance of alternative sources of food (pollen, fungi, other mites) to T. pyri when spider mites are scarce. Temperature responses of this Canadian strain of T. pyri differed from responses reported in western Europe: rates of development from egg to adult were higher at temperatures < 20-degrees-C and lower at temperatures > 20-degrees-C.									16	0	0	0	18	0	19			0046-225X			WOS:A1991GC04200020

During the first weeks of development, when mortality is the highest, Ambystoma mexicanum depends on a diet of zooplankton. The aim of this study was to check whether contamination levels in lake Xochimilco influence zooplankton consumption by similar size classes of A. mexicanum and Oreochromis niloticus. In this study, we analysed changes in the functional responses and prey preference of A. mexicanum and larval Tilapia in two media, one with filtered lake Xochimilco water and another one with reconstituted water. As prey we used cladocerans (Moina macrocopa, Alona glabra, Macrothrix triserialis and Simocephalus vetulus) and ostracods (Heterocypris incongruens). Zooplankton was offered in 5 different densities, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 ind./mL. Prey consumption by A. mexicanum varied in relation to the species offered and age of the larvae. From the first week to the eighth week prey consumption by A. mexicanum increased by 57%. Our functional response tests showed that regardless of the prey type, prey consumption by A. mexicanum was lower in the contaminated water from lake Xochimilco. Among the zooplankton offered in the contaminated environment predators preferred smaller and slower moving microcrustaceans such as Alona glabra and Heterocypris incongruens. Furthermore, O. niloticus preferred prey such as Moina macrocopa and Macrothrix triserialis in the contaminated medium and was more voracious than the axolotl. Our results indicate that both water quality of the lake and the presence of the more resistant exotic fish adversely impact the survival of this endangered amphibian.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1129-5767	1723-8633		WOS:000326626700014

Understanding these fluctuations is critical for developing more accurate fisheries models, which are needed for both scientific and socioeconomic research. Growth, survival, and dispersal of marine planktonic larvae rely strongly on their behavior. Larval fish change their vertical positioning due to strong vertical gradients in light, temperature, predation pressure, and prey availability. Here, we explore how various behavioral rules predict vertical distribution, growth, and survival of larval cod (Gadus morhua) in a numerical model. The rules determine the trade-offs between larval growth, feeding rate, and predation rate, including their dependence on gut fullness and body mass. We evaluated the survival through size classes for different rules and random behavior and compared model predictions with observed larval distribution patterns. The rules predicted the correct average depth position with larval size, but failed to predict the timing of the observed vertical distribution pattern. However, model simulations revealed significant increases in survival for larval and juvenile cod with active behavior compared with larvae with random behavior. Behavior was important across all sizes of fish, and this study illustrates the value or added information of incorporating behavior in biophysical models.									38	0	0	0	35	0	38			1045-2249	1465-7279		WOS:000265950200005		
J	Ohlberger, Jan				Ohlberger, Jan/H-3262-2019	Ohlberger, Jan/0000-0001-6795-240X			Climate warming and ectotherm body size - from individual physiology to community ecology								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				27	4	SI		991	1001		10.1111/1365-2435.12098				AUG 2013	2013	1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services.2. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate.3. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems.4. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feed-backs at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems.5. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels.6. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.									128	2	0	0	110	1	129			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000329303900016

The ABACuS v2 end-to-end model together with climate projections from the NEMO-MEDUSA 2.0model were used to evaluate the effects of fishing, warming and horizontal and vertical mixing on the southern Benguela upwelling system. Of the drivers examined in this study, warming had the greatest effect on species biomass, with mainly negative effects. The magnitude of the impacts of warming intensified from the RCP 2.6 to the 8.5 emission scenario. Fishing negatively affected demersal and large pelagic fish, which in turn resulted in a biomass increase of forage fish due to a decrease in predation pressure. Water mixing was found to have minor indirect effects on zooplankton biomass and fish. The responses of species and species groups to the combined effects of fishing and warming were approximately equally divided between additive, synergistic and antagonistic. Interpretation of our model results suggests that the southern Benguela system is likely to be affected by climate change, including substantial changes in the abundance of some species important to the region's fisheries. Future planning for fisheries needs to take this into account, including through management that strives to maintain the resilience of key species and the system as a whole. In line with previous studies on the southern Benguela, the results reinforce the importance of including consideration of the indirect and combined impacts of climate change and fishing in management and planning.									9	0	0	0	10	0	10			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000440920600008

Invertebrate prey contributions to juvenile Coho Salmon diet from riparian habitats along three Alaska streams: Implications for environmental change								JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY				34	1			617	631		10.1080/02705060.2019.1642243				JAN 1 2019	2019	Stream fish rely on a mix of terrestrial and aquatic prey sources. While the importance of terrestrial invertebrates as a food source for stream fish is well documented, the role of aquatic insects that emerge from the stream as winged adult insects (aquatic winged adults) and return to the stream as prey is less understood. In this study we determined the proportion of total diet for stream-rearing juvenile Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) that is derived from terrestrial and aquatic winged adult invertebrates which enter the stream from riparian habitats and consider how those cross-ecosystem prey contributions vary based on riparian habitat type. Study reaches were identified in three streams within the Kenai River watershed of Alaska that were representative of habitats found throughout the region and riparian vegetation was classified into grass/sedge, shrub and tree types using LiDAR. Juvenile Coho Salmon stomach contents were sampled seasonally in study reaches over a two-year period and ingested invertebrates were identified by taxa, life stage and origin. Our results showed that aquatic winged adult prey contributions to juvenile salmon diet were significantly lower in the grass/sedge study reach, and cross-ecosystem invertebrate prey represented a significantly higher proportion of juvenile salmon diet in the tree study reach. Invertebrate prey in the grass/sedge reach were composed primarily of the larval life stage of aquatic winged adults. These results suggest that change in riparian vegetation from tree/shrub to grass/sedge along Kenai streams as projected by regional climate change models, or that results from anthropogenic modification, will likely lead to lower availability of cross-ecosystem prey for stream fish. Management of riparian buffers along streams to preserve or increase occurrence of trees and shrubs is likely to help mitigate impacts of those possible changes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0270-5060	2156-6941		WOS:000486491200001

Here we investigate the effects of temperature on the performance of the turtle feeding apparatus in a defensive context. We measured bite force and the kinematics of snapping in the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina) over a wide range of body temperatures. Bite force performance was thermally insensitive over the broad range of temperatures typically experienced by these turtles in nature. In contrast, neck extension (velocity, acceleration, and deceleration) and jaw movements (velocity, acceleration, and deceleration) showed clear temperature dependence with peak acceleration and deceleration capacity increasing with increasing temperatures. Our results regarding the temperature dependence of defensive behavior are reflected by the ecology and overall behavior of this species. These data illustrate the necessity for carefully controlling T-b when carrying out behavioral and functional studies on turtles as temperature affects the velocity, acceleration, and deceleration of jaw and neck extension movements. More generally, these data add to the limited but increasing number of studies showing that temperature may have important effects on feeding and defensive performance in ectotherms. J. Exp.

J	Meise, CJ; Johnson, DL; Stehlik, LL; Manderson, J; Shaheen, P								Growth rates of juvenile winter flounder under varying environmental conditions								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				132	2			335	345		10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132<0335:GROJWF>2.0.CO;2				MAR 2003	2003	Fluctuations in juvenile winter flounder growth have been attributed to large-scale fluctuations in temperature, mesoscale fluctuations in salinity, and smaller-scale factors such as prey abundances. This study examines individual growth rates determined through otolith increment counts of free-living juvenile winter flounder during the 2000 settlement period (April 11-July 7) in Navesink River-Sandy Hook Bay estuary in New Jersey. The fish grew at highly variable rates (mean = 1.02, range = 0.25-1.91 mm/d) and did not demonstrate localized differences in growth. In addition, growth rates determined by changes in length of fish from two local areas (river and bay) were compared in the laboratory. Growth in these fish was highly variable, did not differ with location, but did decline significantly during the settlement period in the river (mean = 0.17 mm/d, range = 0.00-0.54 mm/d) and bay (mean = 0.27 mm/d, range = 0.02-0.61 mm/d). The laboratory observations supported field results of no significant differences between river and bay growth rates. General additive models were used on estuarywide field growth rates to examine their relationship with environmental variables. We found a significant positive linear relationship between growth and average water temperature and negative relationships between growth and temperature range and salinity. Food abundance showed the only curvilinear relationship with growth rate, indicating lower growth at food levels below 50 individuals/m(2). Long-term sampling was conducted to examine the effects of these early growth conditions on fall survivors. Through this sampling, it was revealed that winter flounder continued to metamorphose late into the season (July-August). By spawning over several months and having many offspring with variable growth rates, winter flounder may increase the probability of some members surviving the innate variability of a temperate estuary.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000181732900014		
J	Searcy, Steven P.; Eggleston, David B.; Hare, Jonathan A.								Is growth a reliable indicator of habitat quality and essential fish habitat for a juvenile estuarine fish?								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				64	4			681	691		10.1139/F07-038				APR 2007	2007	A common assumption throughout the marine ecological and fisheries literature is that growth is a valid indicator of habitat quality and can be used as a criterion for designation of essential fish habitat (EFH). In this study, the validity of growth as an index of habitat quality was tested by examining how variability in otolith growth was related to abiotic and biotic environmental conditions and could be biased by previous growth history, density dependence, and selective mortality. The study was conducted with juvenile Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) collected in two North Carolina, USA, estuaries during two seasons of two recruitment years. Water temperature, a component of habitat quality, explained nearly 40% of the variability in juvenile otolith growth. There was also evidence that estimates of growth could be biased by density dependence (slower growth at higher conspecific abundance) and by selective mortality (higher mortality of individuals with relatively slower larval and juvenile otolith growth). Studies using growth-based assessment of habitat quality that fail to identify factors underlying growth rate differences among habitats may reach incorrect decisions regarding quality of different habitats and assignment of EFH.									32	0	0	0	32	0	32			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000247602200009

The two species were treated at normal (Mean: 17.8 degrees C, Max: 21.8 degrees C, Min: 13.4 degrees C) and elevated (Mean: 20.8 degrees C, Max: 25.5 degrees C, Min: 15.7 degrees C) daily temperature profile from first instar to 10-day-old adult and fed S. avenae ad libitum. Elevated temperatures caused higher consumption rates in both coccinellids but different responses in weight gain and body fat accumulation within the first 10 days of adulthood. Harmonia axyridis males were poor converters of consumed biomass into body weight and H. axyridis females showed the lowest efficiencies for converting food into body fat content, particularly at elevated temperatures. These results show different temperature-dependent responses of C. septempunctata and H. axyridis and are discussed in relation to their different biology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-3829	1861-3837		WOS:000332754700006

However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have tested the growth-mortality hypothesis for both larval and juvenile stages of flatfishes. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between growth rate and environmental factors and tested the hypothesis for both larval and juvenile stages of marbled sole Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae in Hakodate Bay, Japan from 2001 to 2003. For both larval and juvenile stages, otolith growth correlated with water temperature. Eye-migrating larvae were defined as survivors of planktonic life (SVpelagic). Large juveniles captured in late June and July were defined as survivors of shrimp predation (SVjuvenile). To test the growth-mortality hypothesis, otolith growth was compared between the SV and the original population. During the pelagic larval stage, growth-selective survival was not detected in any of the 3 yr. During the early juvenile stage, fast-growing individuals survived selectively in 2002 but not in 2003. In 2002, population growth of juveniles was slow because water temperatures were low. Thus, juveniles in 2002 required time to exceed the size spectrum that is vulnerable to shrimp predation; consequently, the individuals that grew more rapidly were able to survive selectively. Our results show the importance of the early juvenile stage for the survival of flatfishes.									15	0	0	0	15	0	16			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000328086100020

We analyzed 1773 stomach samples from 39 fish species collected during a bottom trawl survey of the eastern Chukchi Sea in the summer of 2012. We used hierarchical cluster analysis of diet dissimilarities on 21 of the most well sampled species to identify four distinct trophic guilds: gammarid amphipod consumers, benthic invertebrate generalists, fish and shrimp consumers, and zooplankton consumers. The trophic guilds reflect dominant prey types in predator diets. We used constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to determine if variation within the composite guild diets could be explained by a suite of non-diet variables. All CAP models explained a significant proportion of the variance in the diet matrices, ranging from 7% to 25% of the total variation. Explanatory variables tested included latitude, longitude, predator length, depth, and water mass. These results indicate a trophic guild structure is present amongst the demersal fish community during summer in the eastern Chukchi Sea. Regular monitoring of the food habits of the demersal fish community will be required to improve our understanding of the spatial, temporal, and interannual variation in diet composition, and to improve our ability to identify and predict the impacts of climate change and commercial development on the structure and functioning of the Chukchi Sea ecosystem.

Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) play a key role in the Arctic marine food web, serving as a food source that is estimated to contribute up to 75 % of energy transfer to higher trophic levels. To investigate Arctic cod residency and distribution in Resolute Bay (74A degrees 44'N, 095A degrees 04'W), 85 individuals from four locations in the bay were captured, measured, weighed, implanted with acoustic tags and subsequently tracked on an acoustic array of 49 receivers. Two main periods of residence in the bay were identified, the first in open water and the second under ice cover, and both concluded with a collective mass departure of fish. A generalised linear mixed model was used to investigate the influence of variables on Arctic cod presence/absence in the bay, indicating that ingress and egress were influenced by environmental changes, particularly those associated with the transition from open-water to the ice-covered period. Timing and distribution, during the study period, appeared to be influenced by a combination of physiological acclimation, and a balance between resource availability and refuge from predators. Receiver site Residence Index (RI) analysis revealed strong site fidelity of fish towards the northern areas of the bay, and this behaviour was consistent between tagging groups and individuals, indicating that the majority of tagged cod were representative of a single school. This study represents the first employment of acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of individual Arctic cod over 9 months, incorporating both open-water and ice-covered periods.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000378782300009

Predation risk for crayfish differs between drought and nondrought conditions								FRESHWATER SCIENCE				35	1			91	102		10.1086/683333				MAR 2016	2016	Predation risk for aquatic prey is affected by habitat characteristics and the predator community. Relative predation risk for aquatic prey from terrestrial and aquatic predators may differ in drought and nondrought conditions because access to aquatic prey may be affected by water depth. We compared predation risk for crayfish in a human-dominated landscape during severe drought conditions to that during a nondrought year with a standardized assay in which tethered crayfish were exposed to predators. We placed trail cameras at tethering locations to detect whether mortality was from terrestrial or aquatic predators. We evaluated effects of crayfish size, in-stream characteristics, and landscape context on crayfish mortality. Risk factors for crayfish changed between the drought and nondrought conditions. During the drought of 2012, predation risk was associated negatively with cover of submerged vegetation, whereas crayfish size was the main risk factor in 2013 when streams returned to normal or above-normal streamflow. Risk was driven primarily by aquatic predators, although predation by terrestrial predators increased during the drought. Predation risk was related positively to stream size and negatively to urbanization, but only during nondrought conditions. Increased variability in hydrology expected under climate change may alter predation risk for crayfish and other aquatic prey in streams.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			2161-9549	2161-9565		WOS:000370993800008

Nonconsumptive effects of a range-expanding predator on juvenile lobster (Homarus americanus) population dynamics								ECOSPHERE				10	10					e02867	10.1002/ecs2.2867				OCT 2019	2019	Distribution shifts poleward are a widespread response to climate change and can result in altered community composition and interactions among species that previously were geographically isolated. The novel communities and species interactions that may arise during range shifts provide an opportunity to study fundamental ecological processes, while also addressing potential conservation issues. Black sea bass (Centropristis striata) historically ranged from the Gulf of Mexico to Cape Cod, but recently have expanded north into the Gulf of Maine. Very little is known about the impact of this range expansion on benthic community structure throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine. To investigate the effects of sea bass on the behavior of juvenile American lobsters (Homarus americanus), we manipulated the presence of sea bass olfactory cues and quantified shelter use and foraging behavior of lobsters from three regions in the Gulf of Maine with different potential contact histories with sea bass. Sea bass presence increased shelter usage and reduced foraging in lobsters, but contact history influenced the strength of these behavioral responses. Lobsters with no previous contact with sea bass did not significantly increase shelter usage or decrease movement in their presence but did reduce their foraging rate on mussels. This observed reduction in consumption indicates that naive lobsters recognize novel predators, but the ineffective anti-predator responses exhibited support the naive prey hypothesis. Meanwhile, lobsters with the longest potential contact history with sea bass significantly increased shelter usage when sea bass were present; however, they exhibited limited movement and foraging behavior in both the absence and presence of sea bass. Finally, lobsters with a short potential contact history with sea bass exhibited increased shelter usage, reduced movement, and reduced mussel consumption in the presence of sea bass, revealing that juvenile lobsters quickly adapt anti-predator defenses to avoid this novel threat. Overall, these results suggest that prey contact history with novel predators mediates the strength of their nonconsumptive effects, and consequently can influence geographic patterns in predator-prey dynamics.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2150-8925			WOS:000493528200026

As the factors influencing flatworm predation pressure on land snails remain unclear, I examined the effects of seasonal variation in flatworm predation pressure on land snail survival in the wild on a subtropical island. I also examined the feeding activities of P. manokwari under laboratory conditions. Survival rates of land snails experimentally placed on the forest floor for 7 days ranged from 0% to 100% among seasons on the oceanic island Chichijima [Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands]. More than 90% of snails were killed by P. manokwari within 7 days in the period from July to November, while less than 40% of snails were killed in other months. Snail mortality rate (0-100%) attributable to P. manokwari was positively correlated with mean temperature (17.1-27.3 degrees C) in the study area. Laboratory experiments showed that low temperature influenced snail survival and regulated feeding activity of A manokwarl. Laboratory experiments also suggested that high densities of P. manokwari may cause a rapid decline in snail survival. Therefore. ambient temperature and density of P. manokwari may regulate seasonal variations in predation pressure on land snails. Recent global warming may increase the probability of invasion and population establishment, and elevate the impacts of P. manokwari in temperate regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, climate-induced tree mortality and biotic disturbance agents are largely absent from process-based ecosystem models. Using data sets from the western USA and associated studies, we present a framework for determining the relative contribution of drought stress, insect attack, and their interactions, which is critical for modeling mortality in future climates. We outline a simple approach that identifies the mechanisms associated with two guilds of insects - bark beetles and defoliators - which are responsible for substantial tree mortality. We then discuss cross-biome patterns of insect-driven tree mortality and draw upon available evidence contrasting the prevalence of insect outbreaks in temperate and tropical regions. We conclude with an overview of tools and promising avenues to address major challenges. Ultimately, a multitrophic approach that captures tree physiology, insect populations, and tree-insect interactions will better inform projections of forest ecosystem responses to climate change.									269	7	0	0	216	0	277			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000365392100007	26058406

Weather is known to influence reproductive success in numerous species, although such effects have not been reported in all studies, perhaps because they are masked by high nest predation rates or buffered by density dependence. Here, we use a 19-yr study of a population of individually marked long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus to quantify the impacts of weather on productivity in the nest (from eggs to fledging) and subsequent recruitment, while taking nest predation rates and density dependence into account. We find that weather has negligible effects on clutch size, hatching success, brood size, probability of fledging and number of fledglings. Annual variation in nest predation rates is a strong predictor of productivity, but we find no evidence that the magnitude of nest predation is determined by weather. Recruitment was strongly associated with breeding season weather, even when taking density dependence effects into account. This contrasts with the conventional view that first year survival of temperate passerines is primarily determined by winter weather. Recruitment was reduced when March temperatures were high, perhaps caused by earlier peaks in caterpillar abundance and thus reduced food availability at the time of fledging. Recruitment increased following high May temperatures, perhaps due to an improved thermo-regulatory environment for young fledglings. These opposing effects of warm March and May temperatures highlight the importance of considering asymmetrical rates of warming in different months when predicting climate change impacts.									12	0	1	0	12	0	12			0908-8857	1600-048X		WOS:000363732600002

Bioenergetic models have been instrumental in the development of food web theory, using allometric relationships with body mass, temperature, and explicit energy flows. However, despite their popularity, little is known about the constraints they impose on assembly dynamics. In this study, we build on classical consumer-resource theory to analyze the implications of the assembly process on trait selection in food webs. Using bioenergetic models, we investigate the selective pressure on body mass and conversion efficiency and its dependence on trophic structure and temperature. We find that the selection exerted by exploitative competition is highly sensitive to how the energy fluxes are modeled. However, the addition of a trophic level consistently selects for smaller body masses of primary producers. An increase in temperature triggers important cascading changes in food webs via a reduction of producer biomass, which is detrimental to herbivore persistence. This affects the structure of trait distributions, which in turn strengthens the exploitative competition and the selective pressure on traits. Our results suggest that greater attention should be devoted to the effects of food web assembly on trait selection to understand the diversity and the functioning of real food webs, as well as their possible response to ongoing global changes.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1874-1738	1874-1746		WOS:000388954400004

If they can indeed locate prey-rich patches efficiently, then a patchy distribution of planktonic prey should lead to: (1) an increase in the overall per capita food intake, and (2) greater variability among predators in prey-capture rate due to differences in arrival times. Both phenomena were observed in 34 daily feeding sessions with a cohort of juvenile rudd held in twin experimental systems, each housing the same number of fish free to move in a loop of ten interconnected 200-L tanks. The fish were fed daily with equal numbers of planktonic prey (Artemia nauplii), offered either in a homogeneous or patchy distribution. To simulate low and high temperatures that represent potential global warming scenarios, the feeding protocol was replicated at 16, 21 and 26 A degrees C, on each occasion following a 3-day period of fish acclimation. Up to 40-70 % of fish in the system with the patchy prey distribution assembled rapidly in the high-prey-density tank, the capture rate of first arrivals being up to 60 prey min(-1) at 26 A degrees C, orders of magnitude greater than that of latecomers. The overall capture rates were higher in the system with patchy prey, regardless of the temperature. At the highest temperature (26 A degrees C), the fish located the high-prey-density tank in less than half the time taken at the lowest temperature (16 A degrees C, Q (10) > 2).									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000368829300008	26558624	
J	Isikber, AA; Copland, MJW								Food consumption and utilisation by larvae of two coccinellid predators, Scymnus levaillanti and Cycloneda sanguinea, on cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii								BIOCONTROL				46	4			455	467		10.1023/A:1014181920308				DEC 2001	2001	This study was carried out under laboratory conditions at various temperatures to compare food consumption and efficiency of conversion of food to body mass for larvae of two coccinellid predators, Seymnus levaillanti Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Cycloneda sanguinea (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which differ in body size and feeding method. The consumption rate of each larval stage of both species increased with increasing temperature. The consumption rate for total development (from egg hatch to pupation) of S. levaillanti was found to be 22.9 aphids per day at 30degreesC. It was much higher for C. sanguinea (975.1 aphids per day at 25degreesC and 1066 aphids per day at 30 degreesC). The larger species, C. sanguinea was more voracious at each temperature than the smaller species, S. levaillanti. The larvae of S. levaillanti, employing pre-oral digestion, were more efficient in converting food to body mass than larvae of C. sanguinea, which used chewing and sucking. The fourth instars of both species were less efficient in converting food to body mass than were their first three instars. It was concluded that body size and feeding method of coccinellid predators play an important role in food consumption and efficiency of conversion of food to body mass.									24	1	0	0	26	1	28			1386-6141			WOS:000173564400006

Because spiders are ectothermic animals, the temperature regime of the microhabitat in which an individual finds itself may affect important performance traits of that individual, The present study examined the effects of temperature on attributes of webs spun by Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. Koch), as well as testing temperature preference in this species. The effects of temperature on the amount of silk per web produced by Achaearanea tepidariorum and the prey-capture efficiency of webs produced at different temperatures were determined by using webs constructed at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. The temperature preferences of A. tepidariorum within a thermal gradient were also determined,2. Web mass was related to temperature, exhibiting a quadratic relation with a maximum web mass occurring at approximately 20 degrees C.3. Number of strands per cm(3) of webs varied directly with web mass; webs with greater strand densities were more efficient at capturing flies.4. The number of spiders observed in each temperature range in the thermal gradient indicated a non-uniform distribution, with the spiders avoiding temperatures in the highest range (27.3 +/- 2.0 degrees C).5. These data suggest an optimal temperature for web construction at which webs produced are more efficient at capturing prey. The data also suggest that this species may avoid sites that do not provide an adequate thermal environment.									25	2	0	0	26	0	29			0269-8463			WOS:A1997WR93700001		
J	Thompson, Kevin A.; Heppell, Selina S.; Thompson, Grant G.								The effects of temperature and predator densities on the consumption of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) by three groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				71	8			1123	1133		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0260				AUG 2014	2014	Many multispecies models have assumed that prey density determines per-capita predator consumption rates, following a functional response relationship. However, empirical evidence suggests that a predator's diet can also be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, including interactions with other predators. We used diet and abundance data from National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) bottom trawl surveys for three groundfish predators (Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria)) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) to determine whether temperature or other species influence the consumption of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). Using an information-theoretic approach, we tested for relationships between walleye pollock observed in predator stomachs and predator length, bottom temperature, prey availability (walleye pollock catch per unit effort (CPUE) scaled by observed prey lengths), and CPUE of the three predators and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias). Predator length was positively related to walleye pollock presence and proportion of total diet mass in all predators. Increased temperatures negatively affected consumption of walleye pollock by Pacific halibut, but not the other predators. We found evidence for a number of interpredator effects of co-occurring predators, both positive (facultative) and negative (competitive). Surprisingly, observed prey density was not statistically significant with respect to consumption for these predators, suggesting that trawls sample the environment far differently than walleye pollock predators or species interactions are more complex than those used in previous multispecies models. These factors should be considered for future models contributing to ecosystem-based management.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000341517800001

Fish were killed, stained, and scored for lateral plate number and pelvic score. We also measured the pH and concentration of dissolved calcium and phosphorous of each loch. We assessed the abundance of predatory trout in a subset of lochs by 'fly fishing' using a lure that mimicked the appearance of sticklebacks.Results: Dissolved calcium and phosphorous predicted stickleback lateral plate number and pelvic score, while trout abundance failed to predict either. Attack rates by trout on stickleback lures were higher in lochs with higher numbers of trout, with high water clarity, and at higher water temperatures. Our findings implicate a role for the bioavailability of dissolved ions in selection for reduced lateral plate number and pelvic score evolution, with indirect evidence for an effect of trout predation on the adaptive radiation of stickleback populations on North Uist.					8th International Conference on Stickleback Bahaviour and Evolution8th International Conference on Stickleback Bahaviour and Evolution	JUL 26-31, 2015JUL 26-31, 2015		Stony Brook Univ, Stony Brook, NYStony Brook Univ, Stony Brook, NY	4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1522-0613	1937-3791		WOS:000383109200006

Abundance, size and fitness of adults were maximal on hard substrates. Larvae settled similar to 5 weeks post-spawning and juveniles reached a maximum length of 6 mm after 24 months. Additional size classes of sea cucumbers kept under natural environmental conditions exhibited slow seasonal growth attuned to phytoplankton blooms, indicating that similar to 25 years may be required to reach market size. Juveniles of the predator sea star Solaster endeca (L.) readily fed upon 1.5-2 mm long sea cucumbers. Predation rates on adult C. frondosa by adult S. endeca were modulated by temperature and biased towards injured specimens, suggesting that trawling may exacerbate predation pressure. The combination of slow growth and high predatory pressure enhanced by fishing activities emphasises the need for precautionary management of this emerging fishery in Atlantic Canada.									31	2	1	0	31	0	33			0969-997X	1365-2400		WOS:000284074100002

The development, reproduction, longevity, and life table parameters of A. andersoni were significantly affected by the different temperatures. The duration of the egg, larval, protonymph, deutonymph and total immature stages were reduced when the temperature increased. The total oviposition of A. andersoni was highest at 25 degrees C and lowest at 35 degrees C, and the daily average oviposition increased as the temperature increased, but few eggs were laid at 17 degrees C. The values of the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m), 0.108-0.200), net reproduction rate (R-0, 18.71-36.47) and the mean generation time (t, 14.68-29.73) significantly differed among the five temperatures. The highest net reproduction rate (R-0 = 36.47) was obtained at 25 degrees C. The results of this study indicated that A. andersoni has a high inherent potential for the control of the T. urticae at certain temperatures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0044-586X	2107-7207		WOS:000508933800006

PREDATION OF SEA SCALLOPS AND OTHER INDIGENOUS BIVALVES BY INVASIVE GREEN CRAB, CARCINUS MAENAS, FROM NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				33	2			495	501		10.2983/035.033.0218				SEP 2014	2014	Populations of green crab (Carcinus maenas) have expanded within Newfoundland, and this has raised concern from fish harvesters and scientists regarding bivalve predation in coastal areas on species such as juvenile sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus). We used 2 microcosm experiments to determine (1) the effects of water temperature (5 degrees C and 12 degrees C) on scallop predation; (2) scallop size selection in small and large green crabs and a large indigenous predator, the rock crab (Cancer irroratus); and (3) bivalve prey selection in large green crabs between softshell clams (Mya arenaria), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), and sea scallops. Overall, green and rock crabs captured 4 times more scallops in warm water (12 degrees C) than cold (5 degrees C). Large green (60-70 mm) and rock (75-90 mm) crabs captured similar numbers of scallops, selected medium-size (30-40 mm) scallops, and avoided small (10-20 mm) scallops. Small green crabs (40-50 mm) captured only small scallops. Large green crabs selected softshell clams and blue mussels over scallops. Overall, our research demonstrated that both green and rock crabs can prey on similar sizes of scallops, and suggests that green crabs may be a new predation threat to the shallow coastal scallop populations in Newfoundland.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000342693800017

In general, juvenile rockfish recruit to shallower depths than those occupied by conspecific adults. Habitat use by newly recruited rockfish differs markedly among species. While a few species recruit to shallow-dwelling macrophytes, such as Zostera, many others recruit to larger brown algae, such as Nereocystis and Macrocystis. A few deeper dwelling species recruit to low relief or soft substrata. However, little is known on recruitment of these deeper dwellers. Crustaceans are the major component of the diets of newly recruited Sebastes. Species which continue to forage in the water column shift to larger crustaceans (e.g. euphausids) and fish as they grow. Species which shift to substrate-associated prey soon begin to feed on larger algal-associated gammarid amphipods, shrimps and isopods. Field studies indicate variation in intraspecific growth rates over large geographic distances, among nearby sites and among algal habitats on the same reef, with food availability and water temperature being major factors in the differences. In particular, laboratory studies have shown that temperature is one of the most important factors in growth rates. Many species of juvenile rockfish make ontogenetic movements, often moving into deeper water as they age. Most seasonal movements appear to be related to changes in water temperature and turbulence.									132	3	0	0	122	0	135			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:A1991EU35500022

The Norwegian and Barents Seas (NoBa) Atlantis model was implemented for use in 'what if' scenarios, combining fisheries management strategies with the influences of climate change and climate variability. Before being used for this purpose, we wanted to evaluate and identify sensitive parameters and whether the species position in the foodweb influenced their sensitivity to parameter perturbation. Perturbing recruitment, mortality, prey consumption and growth by +/-25% for nine biomass-dominating key species in the Barents Sea, while keeping the physical climate constant, proved the growth rate to be the most sensitive parameter in the model. Their trophic position in the ecosystem (lower trophic level, mid trophic level, top predators) influenced their responses to the perturbations. Top-predators, being generalists, responded mostly to perturbations on their individual life-history parameters. Mid-level species were the most vulnerable to perturbations, not only to their own individual life-history parameters, but also to perturbations on other trophic levels (higher or lower). Perturbations on the lower trophic levels had by far the strongest impact on the system, resulting in biomass changes for nearly all components in the system. Combined perturbations often resulted in non-additive model responses, including both dampened effects and increased impact of combined perturbations. Identifying sensitive parameters and species in end-to-end models will not only provide insights about the structure and functioning of the ecosystem in the model, but also highlight areas where more information and research would be useful-both for model parameterization, but also for constraining or quantifying model uncertainty.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000458181200015	30735534

Analysis of digestive-tract contents revealed that O. mimus preyed upon 25 different prey items belonging to five zoological groups (Teleostei, Mollusca, Crustacea, Echinodermata and Polychaeta). Cannibalism was only occasional. The results indicate that the diet and food intake of this species are significantly affected by sex and maturation. Senescent individuals ingest a small amount of food, and their diet is mainly based on small, not very motile prey. The food intake, expressed as body weight, of non-senescent individuals is higher in females than in males. Seasonal changes in sea-water temperature seem to be followed by adjustments in food intake. Like other Octopus species, O. mimus appears to be an opportunistic predator.									57	0	0	0	49	4	59			0025-3162			WOS:A1995RZ14800011

This study aimed to characterize oomycete infection in the freshwater copepod Parabroteas sarsi in a temporary pond in Patagonia (Argentina). A complete hydroperiod was monitored, evaluating environmental variables as influencing factors in the oomycete infections. Laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the susceptibility of infected copepods to consumption by predators. Although 5 species of copepods were present in the pond, only ovigerous P. sarsi females were parasitized by oomycetes. Two species of oomycetes were always found together: Aphanomyces ovidestruens and Pythium flevoense. Infections were detected at water temperatures >20 degrees C, with a positive relationship between temperature and parasite prevalence. Infection occurred after a decrease in large filter-feeder densities. The pathogens were not lethal to P. sarsi females in the short-term, but did produce mortality of entire egg sacs, thus negatively impacting subsequent recruitment. Mean prevalence of infection in females was 53 %, reaching 83% in December. Females have the capacity to release an infected egg sac and generate a new one in a few days. This infection does not affect the susceptibility of P. sarsi to the predator Notonecta vereertbruggheni. The decrease in female abundance registered towards the end of the hydroperiod could be related to a combination of factors that may have a differential effect on female survival, such as increasing temperature, the energy cost of egg sac development and carrying and oomycete infection.									1	0	0	0	0	1	2			0177-5103	1616-1580		WOS:000438448900005	29972373

Fragmentation effects (i.e., the breaking apart of landscapes) and edge effects (i.e., ecological differences between edges and interiors of patches, nested within landscapes) are distinct yet related ecological concepts, linked mathematically by the habitat edge-to-area ratio. Our study quantified the separate and interactive effects of fragmentation and edge on predation using temperate seagrass. To assess how predation and generalized consumption were influenced by fragmentation state (i.e., continuous, fragmented), and proximity to edge (i.e., edges, interiors), we used tethering assays with two prey-items: juvenile crabs,Callinectes sapidus, and "squidpops" (dried squid mantle). We also investigated whether faunal densities (a proxy for consumption potential) and temperature (a proxy for a broad suite of seasonal changes) correlated with predation across landscapes. Results showed fragmentation state affected predation (i.e., crab) mortality, yet edge effects did not. Moreover, the directionality of fragmentation effects shifted across a temperature/seasonal gradient. Predation mortality more than doubled in continuous landscapes amidst temperature increases, surpassing initially higher mortality in fragmented landscapes, which did not systematically vary with temperature. This mortality magnitude "flip" matched spatiotemporal trends in faunal densities between continuous and fragmented meadows. Consumption rates of both prey-items increased alongside temperature and neither demonstrated edge effects. However, crabs showed fragmentation effects not seen with squidpops, suggesting differing foraging strategies used by consumers of these prey-items. We conclude that fragmentation and edge effects have dynamic influences on temperate predator-prey interactions, as faunal favorability of habitat heterogeneity can "flip" temporally.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000540950900001	32556593

We present electronic tag and photographic identification data showing a complex suite of behavioral patterns in white sharks. These include coastal return migrations and the fastest known transoceanic return migration among swimming fauna, which provide direct evidence of a link between widely separated populations in South Africa and Australia. Transoceanic return migration involved a return to the original capture location, dives to depths of 980 meters, and the tolerance of water temperatures as low as 3.4 degrees C. These findings contradict previous ideas that female white sharks do not make transoceanic. migrations, and they suggest natal homing behavior.									287	2	0	0	277	8	304			0036-8075			WOS:000232477000046	16210537	
J	Robert, Rene; Parra, Rene								Experimental study of predation by the gilthead bream, Sparus aurata and the gray triggerfish, Balistes capriscus on the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum								AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES				4	3			181	189		10.1051/alr:1991020				JUL 1991	1991	Since 1988, heavy mortality of reared Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum have been observed in the basin of Arcachon. Clam predation by the gilthead bream Spurns aurata and the gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus has been suspected. Therefore, an experimental study of predation on this clam by these two fish has been carried out. Feeding rates were determined according to the size of clams, temperature and degree of protection. The amount of clams ingested varied with the size of predator and prey but both fish were serious clam predator. A daily ingestion of 500 seed and 350 spat has been recorded, 50 to 70% of the prey being eaten during the first 6 hours. Because clams were generally communited by these two fish and bottom marks quite similar, it was not possible to discriminate the intervention of both predators. When water temperature was below 16 degrees C, an important decrease in the feeding activity was observed. A net protection may be used to prevent this kind of predation. The Manila clam mortalities, recorded during the summer period in the basin of Arcachon, can be attributed, to a certain extend, to the intervention of these fish. Spurns aurata is a clam predator but the occurrence of the gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus in the basin of Arcachon is a serious concern because this is a vigorous species which is not commercialy fished and then out of control.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0990-7440	1765-2952		WOS:000209003200007		
J	Blair, Scott G.; May, Chelsea; Morrison, Brian; Fox, Michael G.								Seasonal migration and fine-scale movement of invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in a Great Lakes tributary								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				28	2			200	208		10.1111/eff.12443				APR 2019	2019	To determine whether invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from Lake Ontario were establishing a year-round population in a tributary stream or migrating to the lake, we assessed population and individual movement patterns using mark-recapture assessment generated from weekly backpack electrofishing from May until November 2016. Round goby abundance was low in spring, peaked in summer and decreased again in autumn, suggesting seasonal inward stream migration and outward migration back to the lake. Adult round goby movement patterns were positively associated with changes in water temperature, but this was not the case for juveniles. Juveniles displayed a preference for shallow, upstream habitats. Observations of reproductive individuals coupled with a peak in juvenile abundance following the peak in adult abundance indicate that the tributary was used for reproduction and recruitment. The individual movement was primarily upstream in spring, and there was little net movement in summer, likely during reproduction. Downstream movement occurred in autumn over a short time period, suggesting rapid outmigration to the lake. The combined observations of seasonal population structure and individual movement suggest that tributary streams connected to large, infested waterbodies can be used for round goby reproduction and recruitment, rather than year-round residence. This study provides evidence of round goby seasonal migration and their individual movement patterns within tributary streams, which complements an earlier study in Lake Erie tributaries and may be a common occurrence in other Great Lakes tributaries.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000461901300002

Climate change is transforming precipitation regimes world-wide. Changes in precipitation regimes are known to have powerful effects on plant productivity, but the consequences of these shifts for the dynamics of ecological communities are poorly understood. This knowledge gap hinders our ability to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.2. Precipitation may affect fauna through direct effects on physiology, behaviour or demography, through plant-mediated indirect effects, or by modifying interactions among species. In this paper, we examined the response of a semi-arid ecological community to a fivefold change in precipitation over 7 years.3. We examined the effects of precipitation on the dynamics of a grassland ecosystem in central California from 2007 to 2013. We conducted vegetation surveys, pitfall trapping of invertebrates, visual surveys of lizards and capture-mark-recapture surveys of rodents on 30 plots each year. We used structural equation modelling to evaluate the direct, indirect and modifying effects of precipitation on plants, ants, beetles, orthopterans, kangaroo rats, ground squirrels and lizards.4. We found pervasive effects of precipitation on the ecological community. Although precipitation increased plant biomass, direct effects on fauna were often stronger than plantmediated effects. In addition, precipitation altered the sign or strength of consumer-resource and facilitative interactions among the faunal community such that negative or neutral interactions became positive or vice versa with increasing precipitation.5. These findings indicate that precipitation influences ecological communities in multiple ways beyond its recognized effects on primary productivity. Stochastic variation in precipitation may weaken the average strength of biotic interactions over time, thereby increasing ecosystem stability and resilience to climate change.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000397968700010	27889916

In this study we present an agent-based model (ABM) to predict the growth and distribution of young-of-the-year (YOY) and one-year-old (1+) Atlantic salmon and brown trout in response to flow change during summer. A field study of a real population during both natural and low flow conditions provided the simulation environment and validation patterns. Virtual fish were realistic both in terms of bioenergetics and feeding. We tested alternative movement rules to replicate observed patterns of body mass, growth rates, stretch distribution and patch occupancy patterns. Notably, there was no calibration of the model. Virtual fish prioritising consumption rates before predator avoidance replicated observed growth and distribution patterns better than a purely maximising consumption rule. Stream conditions of low predation and harsh winters provide ecological justification for the selection of this behaviour during summer months. Overall, the model was able to predict distribution and growth patterns well across both natural and low flow regimes. The model can be used to support management of salmonids by predicting population responses to predicted flow impacts and associated habitat change.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000379835600001	27431787

Incidental captures in fishing gillnets are the greatest conservation concern for this species. The present study examines the biophysical interactions between the franciscana prey composition and the marine environment. The feeding regime of franciscana was investigated from stomach contents of incidentally caught animals along the southern Brazilian coast. The characteristics of the franciscana habitat may reveal potential factors affecting the distribution and abundance of marine species, thus the franciscana prey (species number and size) was treated as a function of the oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a), and the spatial (latitude and water depth), and temporal (season) parameters, through Linear and Generalized Linear Models (LM and GLM). Season and latitude were important predictors of the franciscana diet, followed by water temperature and depth. Chla parameter only influenced one fish species and therefore was not useful as an explanatory variable for our study. The influence of the predictors and prey distribution of the franciscana diet are similar to that found in the habitat by research cruise data. Some structures analysed (e.g. squid beaks) may remain longer in the stomachs. Therefore, the findings not only suggest a fairly opportunistic behaviour but it is likely that franciscana may occupy, and possibly for long periods, small spatial ranges. This behaviour might be a strategy for minimizing energetic costs by restricting movements to short distance areas, which can be an important factor for conservation planning along the southern Brazilian coast.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-4343	1873-6955		WOS:000535127900003

At 7 degrees C only 33% of the mites walked and these individuals all walked less than 1.5 cm min(-1). All mites walked at 9 degrees C and at 12 degrees C all were highly active, walking more than 1.5 cm min(-1). Daily food consumption rates of adult female B. tarsalis offered young eggs of Ephestia kuehniella as food were investigated at temperatures of 9-27 degrees C. Food consumption below 13 degrees C was very low. At temperatures of 13-19 degrees C the mean number of fully ingested eggs had a level of between 0.5 and 1.0 egg in 24 h. At temperatures of 21-27 degrees C the mean number of fully ingested eggs was above 1.0 egg in 24 h. The mean number of destroyed eggs per female at temperatures above 13 degrees C ranged from three to five eggs per day.

J	Steele, MA; Forrester, GE					Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X			Variation in the relative importance of sublethal effects of predators and competitors on growth of a temperate reef fish								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				237				233	245		10.3354/meps237233				JUL 18 2002	2002	Sublethal effects of predators on the growth of their prey have been little studied in marine systems and consequently their importance relative to other factors is poorly known. Using a set of field experiments conducted on small artificial patch reefs, we measured the relative importance of the effects of predators and conspecific competitors on the growth of a temperate reef fish, the blackeye goby Coryphopterus nicholsii, and we measured how the importance of the 2 processes varied over time. We found that predators and competitors reduced the growth of the gobies at some times, but not others, and that the relative importance of the 2 processes varied among time periods. Moreover, the importance of the 2 processes varied as a function of body size, with large, fast-growing individuals suffering relatively more from the effects of predators than small, slow-growing individuals, which felt the effects of competition more keenly. Competition increased the variation (CV) in growth rates within populations, but exposure to predators had no effect on growth variability. The strength of both the competitive and predatory effects on growth rates declined from summer to winter, but the effect of competition on growth variability did not change appreciably over time. The decline in the effects of competitors and predators on growth rates corresponded to predictable seasonal declines in water temperature and predator abundance. The relative importance of the sublethal effects of predators was greatest during the summer, when predators were most abundant. This study highlights the potential importance of sublethal effects of predators in marine systems and it suggests that the relative importance of predatory and competitive effects may vary in predictable seasonal and ontogenetic ways.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			0171-8630			WOS:000177535300022		
J	Arendt, MD; Lucy, JA; Munroe, TA								Seasonal occurrence and site-utilization patterns of adult tautog, Tautoga onitis (Labridae), at manmade and natural structures in lower Chesapeake Bay								FISHERY BULLETIN				99	4			519	527						OCT 2001	2001	Ultrasonic transmitters were surgically implanted into adult tautog (n=27,400-514 mm TL) to document seasonal occurrence and site utilization at four sites situated within known tautog habitat near Cape Charles, Virginia, in lower Chesapeake Bay. Tagged tautog were released at the same sites where originally caught within 2 h of capture. Sites were continuously monitored with automated acoustic receivers between 9 November 1998 and 13 October 1999. Two sites consisted of natural bedform. materials and two sites consisted of manmade materials. Ninety-four percent of tautog (n=15) released in fall 1998 remained inshore during winter at sustained water temperatures of 5-8 degreesC, rather than moved offshore during winter as documented for tautog off New York, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Ninety-one percent (n=10) of tautog released in spring 1999 remained inshore during summer when water temperature was 27 degreesC and in the absence of an important food item, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). These findings conflict with assertions that tautog move to cooler water in summer when water temperatures reach 20 degreesC. Tautog released at natural bedform. sites were detected only at these sites throughout the study. Tautog released at manmade structures also displayed high site-utilization patterns, but several tautog periodically moved 2-10.2 km away from these sites over featureless bottom, a known deterrent to emigration for large temperate labrids in other waters. Benthic communities were similar at manmade sites and natural bedform sites, and movement away from manmade sites may have been influenced by habitat size as well as habitat structure. Understanding temporal and spatial utilization of habitats is an important first step to identifying essential fish habitat and to evaluating and protecting fishery resources within Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere.									32	0	0	0	26	0	32			0090-0656			WOS:000172298500001

Hydroperiod-the length of time water is in a wetland-is a critical limiting habitat variable for amphibians as larvae must metamorphose before ponds dry. Changes in precipitation and temperature patterns are affecting hydroperiod globally, but the impact of these changes on amphibian persistence is poorly understood. We studied the responses of Boreal Chorus Frog (Pseudacris maculate) tadpoles to simulated hydroperiods (i.e., water level reductions) in the laboratory using individuals collected from ponds spanning a range of natural hydroperiods (Colorado Front Range, USA). To assess the effects of experimental hydroperiod reduction, we measured mortality, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis. We found that tadpoles grew at rates reflecting the hydroperiods of their native ponds, regardless of experimental treatment. Tadpoles from permanent ponds metamorphosed faster than those from ephemeral ponds across all experimental treatments, a pattern which may represent a predation selection gradient or countergradient variation in developmental rates. Size at metamorphosis did not vary across experimental treatments. Mortality was low overall but varied with pond of origin. Our results suggest that adaptation to local hydroperiod and/or predation and temperature conditions is important in P. maculate. Moreover, the lack of a plastic response to reduced hydroperiods suggests that P. maculate may not be able to metamorphose quickly enough to escape drying ponds. These results have important implications for amphibian persistence in ponds predicted to dry more quickly due to rapid climate change.									28	1	1	0	29	0	30			0018-0831	1938-5099		WOS:000312349200002

The abundance of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus has declined significantly in the northern GSL over the past decade. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the observed decline was correlated to changing environmental conditions. Cetacean sightings data from 292 surveys, resulting in 2986 fin whale encounters from 2007 to 2013, were used to fit 2 separate generalised additive models in terms of (1) bathymetric and oceanographic variables (the proxy model) and (2) modelled krill biomass (the prey model). The concept of 'handling time' was introduced to correct for time off search effort, applicable to other studies relying on opportunistically sampled data. While a positive correlation between krill biomass and fin whale numbers was found, the performance of the proxy model (24.2% deviance explained) was overall better than the prey model (11.8%). Annual predictive maps derived from the final proxy model highlighted 2 key areas with recurrently high relative fin whale abundance and a significant overlap with shipping lanes. While both models provided evidence for an annual decline in relative fin whale abundance, static bathymetric features were the most important predictors of habitat use, and no correlation between dynamic variables and the decline was found. High resolution prey data and a better understanding of the feeding ecology of fin whales are proposed to further investigate the predator-prey relationship and decline of fin whales in the GSL.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000485736900016

The growth rate index (residual of the otolith marginal 3-day mean increment width from the linear regression on knob length) of larvae was compared among three areas: the inshore side of the Kuroshio axis, the Kuroshio axis, and the offshore side of the Kuroshio axis in relation to sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and chlorophyll-a (CHL) concentration. The larvae were more densely distributed in the Kuroshio axis and offshore areas of higher temperature and salinity and lower chlorophyll-a concentration than in the inshore areas of lower temperature and salinity and higher chlorophyll-a concentration. No marked differences in the growth rate index were found among the three areas, even though the larvae in the inshore areas showed slightly higher growth rates in 2013. Despite the broad ranges of environmental factors, no clear relationship between the growth rate index and any environmental factor was detected. The survival potential of Pacific saury larvae was considered to be at least comparable under contrasting environments across the Kuroshio axis. Such a geographical homogeneity is concluded to be attributable to compensable effects of physical and biological factors. We hypothesize that the minority under physically-unfavorable but biologically-favorable conditions on the inshore side of the Kuroshio axis could survive equally well as the majority under physically-favorable but biologically-unfavorable conditions around the Kuroshio axis and on the offshore side of the Kuroshio axis.									5	4	0	0	4	0	9			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000379710700004

However, most of this work has focused on increasing temperature, and still little is known about how the variation in temperature extremes will affect community dynamics. We used the model aquatic community held within the leaves of the carnivorous plant, Sarracenia purpurea, to test how food web dynamics will be affected by high temperature variation. We tested the community response of the first (bacterial density), second (protist diversity and composition), and third trophic level (predator mortality), and measured community respiration. We collected early and late successional stage inquiline communities from S. purpurea from two North American and two European sites with similar average July temperature. We then created a common garden experiment in which replicates of these communities underwent either high or normal daily temperature variation, with the average temperature equal among treatments. We found an impact of temperature variation on the first two, but not on the third trophic level. For bacteria in the high-variation treatment, density experienced an initial boost in growth but then decreased quickly through time. For protists in the high-variation treatment, alpha-diversity decreased faster than in the normal-variation treatment, beta-diversity increased only in the European sites, and protist community composition tended to diverge more in the late successional stage. The mortality of the predatory mosquito larvae was unaffected by temperature variation. Community respiration was lower in the high-variation treatment, indicating a lower ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight clear impacts of temperature variation. A more mechanistic understanding of the effects that temperature, and especially temperature variation, will have on community dynamics is still greatly needed.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000390218300006	27234703

Predation impact was estimated for 2 years, 1995 and 1997, using gut content analysis, experimentally derived digestion time (DT) and abundances of chaetognaths and prey. Pseudocalanus concentrations correlated with water temperature and Calanus marshallae with sea ice extent. Sagitta elegans were less abundant but individuals were larger in 1995, when C. marshallae predominated, compared to 1997, when Pseudocalanus and Acartia were the primary prey. Predation by S. elegans removed < 1% standing stock day(-1) of Pseudocalanus or C. marshallae in 1995 and 1.7 to 2.3% of Pseudocalanus in 1997. The percent of the copepod community biomass required by chaetognaths was estimated to be < 1% in 1995 compared with 8-12% in 1997. Calanus marshallae may be more vulnerable than Pseudocalanus to cumulative predation effects because of its reproductive strategy. The effect of chaetognath predation on the copepod community depends on which copepod species is predominant and its susceptibility to cumulative predation effects, as well as on daily predation impact, both of which varied between years with different climatic conditions.									16	0	0	0	7	2	17			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000234218500004

Largemouth bass are consistently the only fish species in the lake, necessitating the importance of studying filial cannibalism as a valuable energy source although it has potential consequences on recruitment and overall population structure. Annual whole-lake population estimates of juvenile and adult bass ranged 91-460 individuals, and these oscillations had significant differences between periods of higher and lower densities. Captured bass > 150 mm in total length were individually tagged and had their stomach contents analyzed before being released. Despite significant differences in population estimates, we found no relationship with cannibalism. Additionally, we found no apparent patterns relating cannibalism to day of year, water temperature, or recruitment rates. We also found no differences in cannibalism or the size of consumed YOY between juvenile and adult bass. However, we found that recaptured individuals who consumed YOY bass on two or more occasions had significantly longer total length than individuals who consumed YOY bass one time or not at all, which provides additional evidence of dietary specialization as previously found in this population. Notwithstanding these patterns in cannibalism and the potential energetic benefits that it provides, we could not discern the effects of it on either individual growth rates or consequential changes in recruitment and overall population size. Regardless of the ever-present pressure of filial cannibalism, the population sustained recruitment across the whole study period.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0270-5060	2156-6941		WOS:000458561400001		
B	Sunderland, KD						Symondson, WOC; Liddell, JE		Progress in quantifying predation using antibody techniques								ECOLOGY OF AGRICULTURAL PESTS: BIOCHEMICAL APPROACHES		SYSTEMATICS ASSOCIATION SPECIAL VOLUMES			53			419	455						1996	1996	The majority of early research, employing biochemical approaches for estimating predation of agricultural pests, simply used the proportion of positive results in the precipitin test as an index of predation. This approach was gradually improved by incorporating estimates of predator density into predation indices and by allowing for the temperature-dependent rates of antigen digestion characteristic of each species of predator. Further advances came with the use of ELISA, which enabled estimation of the biomass of prey in the gut of an individual predator, and with the development of monoclonal antibodies, which greatly increased the specificity of prey detection in predator guts.The above approach, in common with other indirect or post-mortem techniques (such as electrophoresis), estimates the consumption rate of prey by predators, rather than the predation rate. It is necessary to make this distinction because prey which have not been killed by the predator can, nevertheless, be consumed by it. Conversely, the predator may kill prey but fail to ingest any prey material. Thus consumption and predation are not always synonymous. A knowledge of consumption rates is useful in energetics studies, but information on predation rates is required in investigations of pest control by predators. To convert consumption rates to predation rates (or simply to obtain a crude estimate of the extent to which the measured consumption rates are reliable indices of predation rates) requires, potentially, a large amount of additional information about the specific predator-prey system under investigation. Examples of the extra information required include: (i) the propertion of the prey biomass detected per predator that is due to ingestion of dead prey (scavenging), and ingestion of moribund prey (in the early stages of parasitism and pathogenesis); (ii) the incidence of secondary predation, which results in mis-identification of the primary consumer of the prey (food chain errors); (iii) the extent to which there is pre-oral digestion, partial prey consumption, killing without ingestion (wasteful killing), and wounding of prey that eventually results in death; and (iv) prey size availability in relation to the prey size preference of the predator. Each of these factors may vary according to predator species, hunger level of the predator, prey species, season, crop type and location within the habitat.While it is not feasible to collect all of the above information for each predator-prey system under study, it would be extremely valuable to begin to estimate the order of magnitude of the main categories of potential error in predation rate estimates, at least for a few representative predator-prey systems. This would separate factors of negligible significance from potentially important factors, which might then have to be measured routinely in predation studies. Without such investigations, the possibility will remain that many published predation rate estimates are grossly in error, and that predators have been incorrectly ranked in terms of their probable contribution to the control of specific pests.

J	Hughes, NF; Grand, TC				Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009				Physiological ecology meets the ideal-free distribution: Predicting the distribution of size-structured fish populations across temperature gradients								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				59	3			285	298		10.1023/A:1007608720672				NOV 2000	2000	We describe a habitat selection model that predicts the distribution of size-structured groups of fish in a habitat where food availability and water temperature vary spatially. This model is formed by combining a physiological model of fish growth with the logic of ideal free distribution (IFD) theory. In this model we assume that individuals scramble compete for resources, that relative competitive abilities of fish vary with body size, and that individuals select patches that maximize their growth rate. This model overcomes limitations in currently existing physiological and IFD-based models of habitat selection. This is because existing physiological models do not take into account the fact that the amount of food consumed by a fish in a patch will depend on the number of competitors there (something that IFD theory addresses), while traditional IFD models do not take into account the fact that fish are likely to choose patches based on potential growth rate rather than gross food intake (something that physiological models address). Our model takes advantage of the complementary strengths of these two approaches to overcome these weaknesses. Reassuringly, our model reproduces the predictions of its two constituent models under the simple conditions where they apply. When there is no competition for resources it mimics the physiological model of habitat selection, and when there is competition but no temperature variation between patches it mimics either the simple IFD model or the IFD model for unequal competitors. However, when there are both competition and temperature differences between patches our model makes different predictions. It predicts that input-matching between the resource renewal rate and the number of fish (or competitive units) in a patch, the hallmark of IFD models, will be the exception rather than the rule. It also makes the novel prediction that temperature based size-segregation will be common, and that the strength and direction of this segregation will depend on per capita resource renewal rates and the manner in which competitive weight scales with body size. Size-segregation should become more pronounced as per capita resource abundance falls. A larger fish/cooler water pattern is predicted when competitive ability increases more slowly than maximum ration with body size, and a smaller fish/cooler water pattern is predicted when competitive ability increases more rapidly than maximum ration with body size.									52	2	0	0	48	0	54			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000089978500006

Population regulation requires density-dependent mortality at some phase in the life cycle, which can Occur through predation under certain functional (Type III) and numerical feeding responses. Although the potential to induce regulation has been suggested for some epibenthic predators in the coastal zone, studies linking direct observations of predator-prey responses to observed regulation of the prey population are scarce. The identification of Type III functional response Curves is mainly restricted to laboratory or cage studies, and the effect is con fined to a limited range of prey densities. Numerical responses, especially predator aggregations, may be more common in the natural environment. The response type seems to be affected not only by habitat structure but also by water temperature. Prevailing temperature conditions can affect the functional response type possibly through changes in predator behavior. The effect of temperature on the response Curve appears to be species-specific and hence, predator-prey specific. Therefore, no general effect of latitude on population regulation call be expected. Most likely there is a mosaic of predator-prey interactions that depend oil local habitat, temperature conditions, multiple species interactions and predator and prey species types. We surmise that any latitudinal pattern in the overall recruitment variability along species distributional range is more likely to result from a trend in controlling rattler than regulating factors.

J	Sell, AF; van Keuren, D; Madin, LP								Predation by omnivorous copepods on early developmental stages of Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp.								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				46	4			953	959		10.4319/lo.2001.46.4.0953				JUN 2001	2001	Predation is thought to be an important source of mortality in the early life stages of fish and copepods on Georges Bank. Omnivorous copepods may be predators on copepod eggs and nauplii, but data on feeding rates or selectivity are scarce. As part of the GLOBEC Georges Bank program, we generated functional response curves for the omnivorous copepods Metridia lucens, Centropages typicus, and Temora longicornis feeding on the eggs and nauplii of Cal anus finmarchicus or Pseudocalanus spp. in shipboard pre dation trials. Neither C. typicus nor M. lucens reached saturation feeding on Calanus eggs until prey concentration was > 400 L-1. Individual M. lucens and C. typicus ingested up to 34 +/- 9 (mean +/- SD, n = 3) and 24 +/- 14 eggs d(-1), respectively (6 degreesC). T. longicornis was more abundant in late spring, when they ingested Calanus eggs at rates similar to those of C. typicus. At ambient prey concentrations, ingestion rates of Calanus nauplii were higher than rates of Calanus eggs for the predator M. lucens but were similar for C. typicus. Advanced naupliar stages were less susceptible to predation than young stages. Pseudocalanus nauplii moved faster and were ingested at lower rates than similarly sized Calanus nauplii. Predation rates increased with increasing temperature for the warm-water species C. typicus but decreased for the cold-water species M. lucens. These results may contribute to models predicting the development of copepod populations and their availability to larval fish.									61	1	0	0	44	1	63			0024-3590			WOS:000169214600021

The availability and consumption rates of propagules influence mangrove recruitment and can play a major role in their viability and restoration potential. We assess the potential trophic competition between Goniopsis cruentata and Ucides cordatus, two dominant crab species in the New World, by experimentally comparing herbivory levels between forest stands with varying crab abundance. We hypothesize that herbivory rates (HR) of G. cruentata will be lower in mangroves where it coexists with U. cordatus than in mangroves where U. cordatus is absent. The removal of Rhizophora mangle propagules was very rapid, and HR were overall high and increased through time. However, HR did not differ significantly between mangroves with and without the potential trophic competitor U. cordatus. Our study did not support previous literature indications of food competition between these two crab species, which seem to have developed strategies for competition avoidance.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000358653700010		
J	Thakur, Madhav P.								The role of predators in driving warming-prey diversity relationships: An invertebrate perspective								BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY				47				23	34		10.1016/j.baae.2020.06.001				SEP 2020	2020	Climate warming is one of the key driving forces of biodiversity loss. Yet, our understanding of underlying factors that link warming-biodiversity relationships at both local and regional spatial scales is limited. Here, I review how warming could change local-scale diversity of invertebrate animals. Specifically, I examine whether warming-prey diversity relationships are modulated by changes in predation at higher temperatures. I first review the predictions of bioenergetic models, and then carry out a systematic literature search to find empirical studies that have experimentally tested warming-prey diversity relationships together with warming-predation relationships as well as predation-prey diversity relationships both on land and in water. Empirical studies showed that warming consistently altered predation rates by either increasing or decreasing them. However, warming-prey diversity and predation-prey diversity relationships were inconsistent both on land and in water. Theoretical predictions of positive effects of warming on diversity in resource-rich environments were rarely tested by empirical studies. I suggest that warming-prey diversity and predation-prey diversity relationships can be better understood by incorporating three features of prey species: a) thermal tolerance, b) defense against predation, and c) ability to capture resources in warmer environments. I finally discuss the application of a prey trait-based conceptual framework to predict biodiversity changes from local to regional spatial scales in a warmer world.

However, the interactions between these, and between these and direct local stressors are less well addressed. This review underlines that coral bleaching, acidification, and diseases are expected to interact synergistically, and will negatively influence survival, growth, reproduction, larval development, settlement, and post-settlement development of corals. Interactions with local stress factors such as pollution, sedimentation, and overfishing are further expected to compound effects of climate change.Reduced coral cover and species composition following coral bleaching events affect coral reef fish community structure, with variable outcomes depending on their habitat dependence and trophic specialisation. Ocean acidification itself impacts fish mainly indirectly through disruption of predation- and habitat-associated behavior changes.Zooxanthellate octocorals on reefs are often overlooked but are substantial occupiers of space; these also are highly susceptible to bleaching but because they tend to be more heterotrophic, climate change impacts mainly manifest in terms of changes in species composition and population structure. Non-calcifying macroalgae are expected to respond positively to ocean acidification and promote microbe-induced coral mortality via the release of dissolved compounds, thus intensifying phase-shifts from coral to macroalgal domination.Adaptation of corals to these consequences of CO2 rise through increased tolerance of corals and successful mutualistic associations between corals and zooxanthellae is likely to be insufficient to match the rate and frequency of the projected changes.Impacts are interactive and magnified, and because there is a limited capacity for corals to adapt to climate change, global targets of carbon emission reductions are insufficient for coral reefs, so lower targets should be pursued. Alleviation of most local stress factors such as nutrient discharges, sedimentation, and overfishing is also imperative if sufficient overall resilience of reefs to climate change is to be achieved.

To date, there is no consensus on whether warming increases or decreases consumer needs for dietary carbon (C) relatively to phosphorus (P), thus hindering predictions of secondary production responses to global change. Here, we investigate how the dietary C:P ratio optimising consumer growth (TERC:P: Threshold Elemental Ratio) changes along temperature gradients by combining a temperature-dependent TERC:P model with growth experiments on Daphnia magna. Both lines of evidence show that the TERC:P response to temperature is U-shaped. This shape indicates that consumer nutrient requirements can both increase or decrease with increasing temperature, thus reconciling previous contradictive observations into a common framework. This unified framework improves our capacity to forecast the combined effects of nutrient cycle and climatic alterations on invertebrate production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000525566900009	32212238

We constructed a bioenergetics model of a marine predatory fish (tailor, Pomatomus saltatrix) that incorporated high-resolution ontogenetic diet variation, and compared consumption estimates to those derived from typical bioenergetics models that do not consider ontogenetic diet variation. We found tailor consumption was over-or under-estimated by similar to 5-25% when only including the most common prey item. This error was due to a positive relationship between mean prey energy density and predator body size. Since high-resolution diet data isn't always available, we also simulated how increasing dietary information progressively influenced consumption rate estimates. The greatest improvement in consumption rate estimates occurred when diet variation of 2-3 stanzas (1-2 juvenile stanzas, and adults) was included, with at least 5-6 most common prey types per stanza. We recommend increased emphasis on incorporating the ontogeny of diet and prey energy density in consumption rate estimates, especially for species with spatially segregated life stages or variable diets. A small-moderate increase in the resolution of dietary information can greatly benefit the accuracy of estimated consumption rates. We present a method of incorporating variable prey energy density into bioenergetics models.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000438679100030	30013084

We formulated four alternative baseline configurations of the model and used a factorial design to systematically isolate the effects of factors that determined a good versus bad year. The alternative baseline conditions were obtained by substituting different assumptions about growth, maturity, and mortality into the original baseline configuration. In the simulation experiment, we varied five factors by setting each value to its 1998 (best year) or 2001 (worst year) value: salinity, temperature, zooplankton densities, hydrodynamics, and eggs per age-1 individual at spawning. Although some of the alternative baselines resulted in lower January abundances, estimated finite population growth rates were very similar for all versions. The simulation experiment showed that juvenile growth in the winter prior to spawning (i.e., eggs per age-1 individual) was the most important single factor in making 2001 a bad year, although no single factor alone was sufficient to fully account for the poor conditions in 2001 relative to 1998. Temperature played an important secondary role, and hydrodynamics played a more minor role. The results of the simulation experiment were robust, as similar results were obtained under the four alternative baselines. We compare our results with previous modeling and statistical analyses of the long-term monitoring data; we also discuss some implications of our results for Delta Smelt management and suggest future directions for analyses.

Given the overlap and interactions between different age cohorts in natural populations, separating the factors related to differential survival and growth based on longitudinal field-collected data is problematic. Using a Neotropical annual fish (Austrolebias minuano) with a single age cohort per generation, we used replicated field enclosures to experimentally test the roles of avian predation and fish population density on survival and growth over adult lifespan. We found that mortality risk was higher in larger males and smaller females when predation was experimentally excluded. Exposure to avian predation eliminated this sex-specific effect of body size on survival. No overall sex difference in survival was found in the experiment, despite a female-biased sex ratio in natural populations. Individually based growth rates were highest in enclosures at low population density with no predation risk. Overall, we demonstrate that annual fish suffer high sex-dependent size-specific mortality that is more strongly related to predation than to density-dependent processes. This has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of senescence and other life history traits in annual fishes.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000434109900007

This requires a careful characterization of age-specific mortality rates in nature as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence these rates. We perform this task for two populations of semelparous Pacific salmon. During the breeding season, estimated daily mortality rates increased from 0 to 0.2 - 0.5 ( depending on the year) over the course of several weeks. Early-arriving individuals had a later onset and/or a lower rate of senescence in each breeding season, consistent with adaptive expectations based on temporal variation in selection. Interannual variation in senescence was large, in part because of extrinsic factors ( e. g., water temperature). Predation rates were higher in Pick Creek sockeye salmon ( anadromous Oncorhynchus nerka) than in Meadow Creek kokanee ( nonanadromous O. nerka), but in contrast to evolutionary theory, senescence was not more rapid in the former. Interannual variation may have obscured interpopulation divergence in senescence. Pacific salmon are a promising system for further studies on the physiological, evolutionary, and genetic bases of senescence. In particular, we encourage further research to disentangle the relative importance of adaptive and nonadaptive variation in senescence.									31	0	0	0	29	0	31			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000232832700007	16224721	
J	Brownscombe, Jacob W.; Fox, Michael G.								Living at the edge of the front; reduced predation risk to invasive round goby in a Great Lakes tributary								HYDROBIOLOGIA				707	1			199	208		10.1007/s10750-012-1427-z				MAY 2013	2013	The objective of this research was to determine if the highly invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) experiences lower predation risk during early stages of invasion. We compared round goby predation rates between a recently invaded area (occupied for a parts per thousand 1 year) and a longer established area (a parts per thousand 7 years) of the Trent River, Ontario, Canada. Tethering trials were conducted in three habitat types, and comparable habitats in the two areas were similar in water temperature, velocity and depth. Predation rates of tethered round gobies were on average 27% lower in the recently invaded area. Reduced predation in the recently invaded area may be due to the short duration of round goby occupancy and/or differences in predator communities between the two study areas. Data before the round goby invasion suggest that predator communities were similar between the two range areas, but differences in predator abundance cannot be ruled out as a potential mechanism. Other possible mechanisms include a numerical or learned response by predators over time to a novel prey item. Reduced predation rate during the initial stages of invasion may contribute to the fitness of individuals that migrate into areas not previously occupied, and thus facilitate successful range expansion.									13	0	0	0	12	0	13			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000316332300015

This study investigated the effects of temperature on the capture and destruction of bacteria from urban stormwater runoff in bioretention media using 2-year field evaluations coupled with controlled laboratory column studies. Field data from two bioretention cells show that the concentration of indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli) was reduced during most storm events, and that the probability of meeting specific water quality criteria in the discharge was increased. Indicator bacteria concentration in the input flow typically increased with higher daily temperature. Although bacterial removal efficiency was independent of temperature in the field and laboratory, column tests showed that bacterial decay coefficients in conventional bioretention media (CBM) increase exponentially with elevated temperature. Increases in levels of protozoa and heterotrophic bacteria associated with increasing temperature appear to contribute to faster die-off of trapped E. coli in CBM via predation and competition.

Nitrogen addition increased phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations, while phosphorus addition had no stimulatory effect. A combined N + P treatment was synergistic, increasing both phytoplankton and periphyton > 10-fold above controls. Our results suggest that phytoplankton were primarily limited by nitrogen and secondarily limited by phosphorus and that periphyton was colimited by nitrogen and phosphorus. The grazing effect increased as A. franciscana grew from nauplii to adults and by the final day, A. franciscana had markedly reduced both phytoplankton and periphyton abundance in the Control, +N, and +P treatments. Grazing also significantly reduced periphyton in the N + P treatments. Due to high phytoplankton growth rates in the N + P treatment, A. franciscana grazing did not significantly reduce chlorophyll concentrations during the bioassay. However, A. franciscana in the N + P treatment was significantly larger and had greater reproductive output than in the controls, suggesting that the following generation might have exerted greater grazing pressure.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000392386500001

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				50	1			31	38		10.1007/s00267-012-9868-8				JUL 2012	2012	Bycatch of turtles in passive inland fyke net fisheries has been poorly studied, yet bycatch is an important conservation issue given the decline in many freshwater turtle populations. Delayed maturity and low natural adult mortality make turtles particularly susceptible to population declines when faced with additional anthropogenic adult mortality such as bycatch. When turtles are captured in fyke nets, the prolonged submergence can lead to stress and subsequent drowning. Fish die within infrequently checked passive fishing nets and dead fish are a potential food source for many freshwater turtles. Dead fish could thus act as attractants and increase turtle captures in fishing nets. We investigated the attraction of turtles to decomposing fish within fyke nets in eastern Ontario. We set fyke nets with either 1 kg of one-day or five-day decomposed fish, or no decomposed fish in the cod-end of the net. Decomposing fish did not alter the capture rate of turtles or fish, nor did it alter the species composition of the catch. Thus, reducing fish mortality in nets using shorter soak times is unlikely to alter turtle bycatch rates since turtles were not attracted by the dead fish. Interestingly, turtle bycatch rates increased as water temperatures did. Water temperature also influences turtle mortality by affecting the duration turtles can remain submerged. We thus suggest that submerged nets to either not be set or have reduced soak times in warm water conditions (e.g., > 20 A degrees C) as turtles tend to be captured more frequently and cannot withstand prolonged submergence.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000304623500004	22543581

Very few existing models explicitly incorporate the dynamics from one end of the ecosystem to the other and thus allowing the exploration of interplay between exploitation and climate effects. The shift to an ecosystem approach to fisheries and concerns about the ecological effects of climate change require the assemblage of knowledge assembled from the respective marine disciplines with the view to build end-to-end models of marine ecosystems.Here, with a focus on plankton and fish models, we present some issues and recommendations for the integration of models between trophic levels (vertical integration) and within functional groups (horizontal integration within trophic levels). At present, vertical coupling of plankton and fish models is mainly realized through predation processes, generally represented as a functional response. In the absence of empirical evidence and quantification, the choice of the functional response term is often made by default, and is reduced to a parameterization problem. A strategy is proposed to overcome this arbitrary choice.In addition to the vertical coupling of trophic models, the structure of end-to-end models incorporates biodiversity via horizontal integration of trophic levels. For guiding the selection of key components to be included in end-to-end models, the idea that marine food webs are structured as alternative trophic pathways is highlighted and related to observed dynamics. We suggest that an important early step in model development is the identification of major trophic pathways and bottlenecks in an ecosystem using a historical perspective. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we measured prey capture rates of drift-feeding juvenile brown trout and European grayling at different prey densities in an artificial stream channel at 5 and 11 degrees C. Capture rates were lower at 5 than at 11 degrees C, and the difference was most pronounced at high prey densities. At high prey densities, we also observed that European grayling had higher capture rates than brown trout. Type III functional response curves, i.e. sigmoidal relationships between capture rates and prey densities, fitted the data better than type I (linear) and II (hyperbolic) curves for all four combinations of temperatures and species. These results may explain the dominance of grayling in stream habitats with low water velocities and results such as these may be of use when developing foraging-based food web models of lotic ecosystems that include drift-feeding salmonids.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1023-6244	1029-0362		WOS:000335822300003

Larvae and juveniles (n = 22914) were collected by weekly seining at three sample sites in the upper John Day Reservoir, Columbia River, during June through early September 1994-1996. Using a length-based ageing method, it was estimated that the exponential growth rate (G) for a common growth stanza (10-28 mm standard length SL) was significantly higher in 1994 (G = 0.047) than in 1996 (G = 0.037). Growth rate in 1995 could not be estimated, but was probably intermediate between 1994 and 1996 based on mean standard lengths of fish collected at the end of each sampling season (46.3, 40.0, and 32.0 mm SL in 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively). For many fish species, variations in early growth can influence survival through size-selective mortality processes. Consistent with this possibility, our estimates of instantaneous mortality rates (Z) demonstrated that larvae and juveniles had significantly higher mortality in 1996 than in 1994 (Z = 0.103 in 1994, versus Z = 0.138 in 1996). Enhanced growth and lower mortality in 1994 were associated with a number of interrelated environmental conditions - comparatively low flows and turbidities, abundant instream vegetative cover, and high near-shore water temperatures.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000078949200009

Evidence from physiological ecology and recent studies suggest that in terrestrial systems, water may influence animal behavior and global patterns of species richness. Despite these observations, water has received little attention as a currency directly influencing animal species interactions. Here, we show that the per capita interaction strength between predatory wolf spiders and their primary prey, field crickets, is strong (-0.266) when predators and prey are maintained in ambient dry conditions, but is near zero (0.001) when water is provided ad libitum. Moreover, crickets consume 31-fold more moist leaf material in ambient dry conditions, switching from old litter to moist green leaves when free water is scarce. Under dry conditions, animals may make foraging decisions based first on water needs, not energy or nutrients, suggesting strong and predictable effects of alterations in aridity on species interactions.									43	1	0	0	46	0	46			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000266662500006	19569360	
J	Charbonnier, Yohan; Barbaro, Luc; Theillout, Amandine; Jactel, Herve								Numerical and Functional Responses of Forest Bats to a Major Insect Pest in Pine Plantations								PLOS ONE				9	10					e109488	10.1371/journal.pone.0109488				OCT 6 2014	2014	Global change is expected to modify the frequency and magnitude of defoliating insect outbreaks in forest ecosystems. Bats are increasingly acknowledged as effective biocontrol agents for pest insect populations. However, a better understanding is required of whether and how bat communities contribute to the resilience of forests to man-and climate-driven biotic disturbances. We studied the responses of forest insectivorous bats to a major pine defoliator, the pine processionary moth pityocampa, which is currently expanding its range in response to global warming. We used pheromone traps and ultrasound bat recorders to estimate the abundance and activity of moths and predatory bats along the edge of infested pine stands. We used synthetic pheromone to evaluate the effects of experimentally increased moth availability on bat foraging activity. We also evaluated the top-down regulation of moth population by estimating T. pityocampa larval colonies abundance on the same edges the following winter. We observed a close spatio-temporal matching between emergent moths and foraging bats, with bat activity significantly increasing with moth abundance. The foraging activity of some bat species was significantly higher near pheromone lures, i.e. in areas of expected increased prey availability. Furthermore moth reproductive success significantly decreased with increasing bat activity during the flight period of adult moths. These findings suggest that bats, at least in condition of low prey density, exhibit numerical and functional responses to a specific and abundant prey, which may ultimately result in an effective top-down regulation of the population of the prey. These observations are consistent with bats being useful agents for the biocontrol of insect pest populations in plantation forests.									31	0	0	0	26	0	32			1932-6203			WOS:000345743700068	25285523

The forecasted increase in temperature variability is expected to impose greater stress to organisms, in turn influencing the balance of energy expenditure and consequently life history responses. Here we examine how increased temperature variability affects life history responses to predation. Individuals reared under constant temperatures responded to different levels of predation risk as appropriate: namely, by producing greater number of neonates of smaller sizes and reducing the time to first brood. In contrast, we detected no response to predation regime when temperature was more variable. In addition, population growth rate was slowest among individuals reared under variable temperatures. Increased temperature variability also affected the development of inducible defenses. The combined effects of failing to respond to predation risk, slower growth rate and the miss-match development of morphological defenses supports suggestions that increased variability in temperature poses a greater risk for species adaptation than that posed by a mean shift in temperature.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000342492700065	25250677

Nearshore Fish Assemblages of the Northeastern Chukchi Sea, Alaska								ARCTIC				66	3			257	268						SEP 2013	2013	The Arctic ecosystem is changing rapidly, yet information on nearshore fish assemblages for the northeastern Chukchi Sea is extremely limited. To address this information gap, we sampled nearshore fish assemblages with a beach seine and a small bottom trawl at six stations in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in August 2007, 2008, and 2009, and in September 2009. Catch and species composition differed by gear type and between sample periods, including the two in 2009. A total of 16 039 fish representing 18 species were captured in 24 beach seine hauls, and 3108 fish representing 24 species were captured in 48 trawl tows. Beach seine catch was dominated by capelin (83%), and trawl catch was dominated by Arctic cod (56%). Species that were good discriminators between gear types were capelin (seine) and slender eelblenny (trawl), and unidentified small sculpins were the most common taxa caught with both gear types. Capelin and Arctic cod captured by either gear type were mostly juveniles (judging by size). Variability among sampling periods in catch and species composition within gear types can likely be attributed to annual variations in environmental conditions, including differences in water temperature (range: 2 degrees-9 degrees C). The shallow nearshore environment of the northeastern Chukchi Sea provides important habitat for many fish species and is extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Loss of sea ice from global warming may open up formerly inaccessible areas to oil and gas exploration, vessel traffic, and commercial fishing. Thus, long-term monitoring of nearshore fish assemblages in the Alaskan Arctic is necessary for managers to make informed decisions in this fragile environment.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0004-0843	1923-1245		WOS:000325309500002		
J	Bjornsson, Bjorn								Thermoregulatory behaviour in cod: Is the thermal preference in free-ranging adult Atlantic cod affected by food abundance?								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				76	9			1515	1527		10.1139/cjfas-2018-0305				SEP 2019	2019	This study supports the hypothesis that well-fed cod (Quills morhua) seek higher temperatures to increase growth rate, and poorly fed cod select lower temperatures to save metabolic energy. Depth and temperature of free-ranging adult cod (44-79 cm) were studied with data storage tags as part of a ranching project in an Icelandic fjord. Forage fish were regularly provided at four feeding stations where cod formed distinct "herds" (herd cod) that did not mingle much with the rest of the unconditioned cod in the fjord (wild cod). Several parameters (stomach fullness, liver index (fat reserves), condition factor, and growth rate) indicated that food intake was much greater in herd cod than in wild cod. In August, when the thermocline was well established, the herd cod remained in shallow (15-35 in) and warm water (8-10 degrees C), whereas the wild cod stayed in deep (80-90 in) and cold water (3-4 degrees C), but occasionally both groups explored depths and temperatures outside their preferred range. After vertical mixing in autumn when thermoregulation was not possible, the depth difference between the two groups decreased significantly.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000482618200005

This is the first study on the life cycle, growth and production of Sigara selecta, a Palearctic corixid species typical of brackish and saline waters, at the warmest limit of its European distributional range. The study combines field and laboratory approaches.2. The S. selecta population studied was multivoltine, producing four asynchronous cohorts from early spring to December and overwintering in the adult state. Development time from egg to first adult ranged from 2 to 3 months. A minimum temperature threshold of 10 degrees C and diel amplitude of >= 10 degrees C were observed for reproduction and oviposition.3. Maximum density and biomass were reached in mid spring and early autumn. The sex ratio was unbalanced, females dominating during most of the year, except in spring, when the sex ratio was balanced or dominated by males during the first adult emergence.4. Laboratory rearing experiments at constant temperatures (18, 22 and 26 degrees C) pointed to a significant effect of temperature on egg development and nymphal growth. In the range of temperatures tested, both egg and nymphal instar duration decreased with increasing temperature. Mean nymphal development time varied from 43 days at 26 degrees C to 71 days at 18 degrees C, with a mean of 57 days. Survivorship was independent of temperature.5. A reduction in nymphal and adult length was observed with increasing temperature.6. Growth rates decreased with increasing body mass and increased as temperature increased. The first nymphal instar had the highest length increments and growth rates in all temperature treatments.7. Satisfactory agreement was found between the field and laboratory degree-days required for complete development from egg to first adult. At constant and variable thermal regimes, degree-days decreased with increasing temperature.8. Rate of growth in the field could be predicted with reasonable accuracy from a simple model obtained as a function of body mass. The model explained 67% of the variability in growth rates.9. Annual production and production/biomass ratio (P/B) of S. selecta estimated by the Instantaneous Growth method were 1.28 g m(-2) year(-1) and 13.71, respectively. Spring and autumn cohorts contributed 32% and 54%, respectively, of total annual production. Maximum production corresponded to intermediate temperature periods, although summer production may have been underestimated because of the longer sampling interval relative to cohort interval production. The Size Frequency method underestimated production by at least 18% with respect to the Instantaneous Growth method.									28	0	3	0	26	1	32			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000233290000016

The densities of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates (<60 mum) increased when fish were introduced to enclosures, and then decreased after the fish were removed. The increased densities of the protozoan resulted from relaxed feeding pressure by crustaceans and rotifers, both of which were suppressed by the fish. The growth rates of HNF were not significantly different in fishless enclosures and in enclosures with fish. The growth rates were positively correlated with water temperature (p<0.05). Similarly, ciliate growth rates were not significantly different between the two enclosures, but they were not significantly correlated with any environmental variables. Grazing rates on HNF by zooplankton were significantly higher in fishless enclosures than those in enclosures with fish. The HNF were grazed more heavily by the 10-94 mum predators than by those >94 mum. Grazing rates on ciliates were not different between treatments or between the two size groups of predators. Estimates of the ratio of zooplankton grazing rate on protozoan to zooplankton ingestion rate, indicated that both HNF and ciliates were more important food sources for zooplankton in enclosures with fish than in fishless enclosures. In the presence of fish, zooplankton depended almost exclusively on HNF for food, but in the absence of fish, zooplankton feeding shifted to phytoplankton. The introduction of silver carp to this eutrophic ecosystem changed the pathways of carbon flow from protozoan to zooplankton in the microbial food web.									1	0	1	0	1	0	2			0270-5060	2156-6941		WOS:000223087200003		
J	Jacobs, P.; Beauchemin, C.; Riegman, R.								Growth of juvenile blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) on suspended collectors in the Dutch Wadden Sea								JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				85				365	371		10.1016/j.seares.2013.07.006				JAN 2014	2014	In The Netherlands, fishing for juvenile blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) on wild beds is gradually replaced by harvesting of seeds from suspended collectors. Both the relaxation of fishing as well as the up-scaling of the number of seed collectors are expected to result in an increase in the number of mussels in the Wadden Sea. Consequently, an enhanced mussel population will cause an additional filtration impact on the system. The question is raised to what extent collectors can be used without negatively affecting the carrying capacity of an ecosystem. Therefore, a monitoring programme was initiated to study the growth of juvenile mussels on suspended collectors. This growth was related to food availability, measured as chlorophyll-a, and temperature both before and after settlement. Findings will serve as input for mathematical models predicting the carrying capacity for mussel seed collectors in this area.The results for 2010 and 2011 are presented. In 2011 settled mussels achieved a higher growth rate, while phytoplankton concentrations after settlement were lower. This contradicts the general agreement that higher phytoplankton concentrations result in higher growth rates. A positive relation between chlorophyll-a concentrations during the larval period and the growth rate of settled mussels was found.The number of settled larvae was higher in 2011. Results from existing studies on settlement and recruitment on tidal flats combined with estimated settlement date in the current study led to the hypothesis that the number of settled mussels on rope collectors is inversely related to the duration of the larval period (determined by water temperature). Our results indicated that in the Wadden Sea, the intra-annual differences in chlorophyll-a and temperature did not have an impact on the juvenile growth rate, while the interannual differences did. This is an indication that the larval stage is strongly discriminative in terms of juvenile growth rates.Modelling growth of juvenile mussels on collectors should thus include conditions before settlement.

Across these larger spatial extents, adaptation can play an increasing role in determining the outcome of species interactions. If local adaptation is common, then our ability to generalize measures of species interaction strength across communities will be limited without an additional understanding of the genetic variation underlying interaction traits. In the context of predator prey interactions, prey individuals commonly are expected to reduce risky foraging behaviors and subsequent growth under predation threat. However, rapid growth into a large body size can defend against gape-limited predators, creating a tradeoff between increased predation risk due to elevated foraging activity and decreased predation risk due to large size. Here I combine field observations, natural selection experiments, and common garden assays to understand potential adaptations of spotted salamander Ambystoma maculatum larvae to gape-limited and gape-unconstrained predators. Field observations and natural selection trials suggested antagonistic selection on prey body size among ponds dominated by gape-limited predator salamanders A. opacum and gape-unconstrained beetle larvae Dytiscus. In common garden experiments, prey from sites with high gape-limited predation risk grew larger than those from other sites, suggesting the evolution of rapid growth into a Prey size refuge. Larvae from all sites grew to a large size when exposed to the gape-limited N. viridescens predator's kairomones. Hence, induced rapid growth into a size refuge may be an adaptive response to gape-limited predation risk. Results point to an important role for cross-community generalizations based on functional classifications of predators by their gape constraints and inter-site genetic variation in prey growth rates and behaviors.									43	0	0	0	40	0	43			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000258034400009

Species inhabiting heterogeneous environments tend to differ in competitive abilities depending on environmental stressors. Interactions between these factors can allow coexistence of competing species, which may be particularly important between invasive and native species. Here, we examine the effects of temperature on competitive interactions between invasive mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and an endemic Iberian toothcarp, Aphanius iberus. We compare the tendency to approach heterospecifics and food capture rates between these two species, and examine differences between sexes and species in aggressive interactions, at three different temperatures (19, 24 and 29 degrees C) in three laboratory experiments. Mosquitofish exhibit much more aggression than toothcarp. We show that mosquitofish have the capacity to competitively displace toothcarp through interference competition and this outcome is more likely at higher temperatures. We also show a reversal in the competitive hierarchy through reduced food capture rate by mosquitofish at lower temperatures and suggest that these two types of competition may act synergistically to deprive toothcarp of food at higher temperatures. Males of both species carry out more overtly aggressive acts than females, which is probably related to the marked sexual dimorphism and associated mating systems of these two species. Mosquitofish may thus impact heavily on toothcarp, and competition from mosquitofish, especially in warmer summer months, may lead to changes in abundance of the native species and displacement to non-preferred habitats. Globally increasing temperatures mean that highly invasive, warm-water mosquitofish may be able to colonize environments from which they are currently excluded through reduced physiological tolerance to low temperatures. Research into the effects of temperature on interactions between native and invasive species is thus of fundamental importance.									39	2	0	0	37	1	40			1932-6203			WOS:000314021500118	23382951

Recent climate change has affected a wide range of species, but predicting population responses to projected climate change using population dynamics theory and models remains challenging, and very few attempts have been made. The Southern Ocean sea surface temperature and sea ice extent are projected to warm and shrink as concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases increase, and several top predator species are affected by fluctuations in these oceanographic variables.2. We compared and projected the population responses of three seabird species living in sub-tropical, sub-Antarctic and Antarctic biomes to predicted climate change over the next 50 years. Using stochastic population models we combined long-term demographic datasets and projections of sea surface temperature and sea ice extent for three different IPCC emission scenarios (from most to least severe: A1B, A2, B1) from general circulation models of Earth's climate.3. We found that climate mostly affected the probability to breed successfully, and in one case adult survival. Interestingly, frequent nonlinear relationships in demographic responses to climate were detected. Models forced by future predicted climatic change provided contrasted population responses depending on the species considered. The northernmost distributed species was predicted to be little affected by a future warming of the Southern Ocean, whereas steep declines were projected for the more southerly distributed species due to sea surface temperature warming and decrease in sea ice extent. For the most southerly distributed species, the A1B and B1 emission scenarios were respectively the most and less damaging. For the two other species, population responses were similar for all emission scenarios.4. This is among the first attempts to study the demographic responses for several populations with contrasted environmental conditions, which illustrates that investigating the effects of climate change on core population dynamics is feasible for different populations using a common methodological framework. Our approach was limited to single populations and have neglected population settlement in new favourable habitats or changes in inter-specific relations as a potential response to future climate change. Predictions may be enhanced by merging demographic population models and climatic envelope models.									65	0	0	0	63	1	69			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000285110600009	20840607

Captive Breeding of Endangered Yaqui Topminnow and Yaqui Chub for Recovery Purposes								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE				71	1			73	78		10.1577/A07-074.1				JAN 2009	2009	Yaqui topminnow Poeciliopsis occidentalis sonoriensis and Yaqui Chub Gila purpurea, two federally endangered fishes from the Rio Yaqui basin (Arizona, USA, and Sonora, Mexico), were propagated by various methods, Propagation of Yaqui topminnow was attempted in aquaria and wading pools; the greatest number of offspring was produced in 556-L, plastic wading pools. We added substrate, artificial plants, and it vertical mesh barrier to create refuge for offspring. Fish were stocked when water was 19 degrees C: after I month, when water temperatures exceeded 21 degrees C, Yaqui topminnow started to produce young continuously. Oil average, 7.4 offspring/d were captured from four pools collectively. Yaqui chub were propagated in 189-L, glass aquaria. We manipulated photoperiod, diet, and substrate to induce spawning or Yaqui chub, but success was only achieved after the water was chilled to 17 degrees C for 30 d and then adjusted to 21 degrees C over 14 d. After the water was maintained at 21 degrees C for 3 d, we covered the bottom of each aquarium with glazed ceramic tiles and a raised plastic grid to protect eggs from predation. Broadcast spawning of Yaqui chub occurred at night; the next morning, we retrieved the tiles and the attached eggs and placed them in incubation tanks. Yaqui chub eggs hatched over the next 5 d, and the hatching success rate averaged 83%. After this initial spawn, manipulation or water temperature was not required to induce spawning, as Yaqui chub spawned each time tiles were placed in the tanks. These methods worked well, and we recommend them for propagation of Yaqui topminnow and Yaqui chub.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1522-2055	1548-8454		WOS:000264365100013

This balance varies depending on the relative effect of environmental drivers on these processes. Components and dynamics of the C cycle were measured in a native Eucalyptus delegatensis forest at Tumbarumba in south-eastern Australia during conditions of average rainfall (1998-2001) and droughts (2002-2003 and 2006-2007). In 2002-03 there were interacting disturbance factors of dry conditions and insect damage that reduced the photosynthetically active leaf area in the canopy. Conditions during the droughts included reduced soil moisture content, higher temperatures and increased vapour pressure deficit. Similarly low soil moisture contents occurred during both drought periods, but lasted for longer in 2002-03. The combined impact of drought stress and insect damage resulted in markedly reduced growth (45-80%) and higher mortality of trees (5-60%). Impacts were variable across the 50,000 ha of forest, with mortality greatest in stands with normally highest growth rates, and in locations with greatest reductions in soil moisture. Growth rates were reduced during 2002-03, most severely in 2003-04, and recovering in 2004-05. Mortality remained high in 2004-05 indicating the prolonged effect of the stress conditions. The total C pool in the forest is 483 tC ha(-1) with net C uptake of 6.7 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the growing season prior to the insect attack (2001-02). Under conditions of drought and insect disturbance in 2003 the forest released a total of 1.7 tC ha(-1) over 8 months, while under conditions of drought alone carbon uptake was -6.5 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the growing season year of 2006-07 and -5.6 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the calendar year of 2007. Interacting stress factors of drought and insect damage resulted in a large imbalance in the C budget with a 26% reduction in gross primary productivity and a 9% reduction in ecosystem respiration, whereas drought alone had a much lesser effect. Drought conditions result in (1) weather conditions that break the synchronisation of insects with parasites and predators resulting in insect outbreaks, (2) moisture stress that predisposes trees to attack by insects, and (3) moisture stress that restricts leaf regeneration after damage. Climate change and climatically induced changes in disturbance regimes may affect the processes of photosynthesis and respiration differently and hence change the balance of net ecosystem C exchange. Reduced sink strength of forests will lead to positive C cycle-climate feedbacks, which enhance the greenhouse effect and climate change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Venier, L. A.; Holmes, S. B.								A review of the interaction between forest birds and eastern spruce budworm								ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS				18				191	207		10.1139/A10-009				2010	2010	The eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., (hereafter budworm) is responsible for the largest areas of insect-caused disturbance in North America, and as such, is an important part of spruce fir forest change and succession. The insectivorous forest bird community shows large and rapid responses to budworm outbreaks. There is good evidence that there are budworm-linked species (bay-breasted, Cape May, and Tennessee warblers) that respond to budworm outbreak much more strongly and consistently than other species, probably through increased productivity of local populations when budworm are abundant. There also appears to be a more widespread positive bird community response to budworm outbreak that involves many more species. The response is evident in local and regional scale studies, but individual species' responses across studies are not always consistent, probably because of the relatively small number of studies conducted in a wide variety of contexts. Budworm outbreaks provide a short-term increase in food supply for birds, but also result in longer-term habitat change due to budworm-induced defoliation and tree mortality. Birds appear to influence budworm cycles, mostly at endemic population levels, through predation of large larvae and pupae. There are good arguments suggesting that bird predation is not the primary cause of budworm oscillations, but may play a role in determining the mean level of oscillations. Climate change is expected to change the bird budworm relationship through changes in fire regimes, spruce fir distributions, bird distributions, and budworm and bird phenology.									18	0	0	0	16	1	20			1208-6053	1181-8700		WOS:000285680400010

Changes in biotic interactions and climate determine recruitment of Jeffrey pine along an elevation gradient								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				239	1-3			57	68		10.1016/j.foreco.2006.11.010				FEB 15 2007	2007	The mechanisms by which climate affects recruitment and loss of plants and the interactions between those plants and other organisms (e.g., pathogens, granivores, seed dispersers) have seldom been studied in the context of plant response to climate change. We examined how climate influences Jeffrey pine (Pines jeffreyi) recruitment, mortality, and species interactions at three elevation zones (low, mid, high) across its elevation range (1550-2470 m) in the semi-arid Carson Range of western Nevada. Local climate was correlated with several aspects of stand structure, including smaller trees, slower growth rates, greater predation by seed insects, and higher tree mortality at low elevation. Cone crop was not affected by elevation, but there were more mature trees and more filled seeds per cone at mid- and high elevations. Populations of seed-caching rodents were largest at mid-elevation, but sufficient rodents were present at all elevations to cause rapid removal and dispersal of pine seeds. Seedling emergence from rodent caches was greatest at low and middle elevation, but seedling survival was best at middle and high elevations. The number of saplings was greatest at mid-elevation sites. These results suggest a retracting population at low elevation (high adult tree mortality and low recruitment), a rapidly expanding population at mid-elevation (low adult tree mortality and high recruitment), and a slowly expanding population at high elevation (low adult tree mortality and low recruitment). These demographic patterns foreshadow a shift in distribution upslope over future decades, driven by changes in climate and facilitated by biotic interactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the role of an inducible defense as a factor that influences the trophic pathway in an aquatic food web. Quantitative information on food web structure in Lake Suwa (a eutrophic lake in Japan) was provided by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses using samples taken during summer and a structural equation model applied to annual monitoring data. As predicted, there was none or only a weak link detected between the prey with induced defenses (Bosmina fatalis) and its invertebrate predator (Leptodora kindtii). The effects of an inducible defense on the trophic links are based mainly on the mortality or population growth rate of organisms using predation, population (or community) level experiments, field data, and model estimates. However, there was no research linking these different data using stable isotope analyses. Our research provides new evidence supporting previous studies by suggesting the importance of the inducible defense in determining food web structure and function.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000345036000002

The relationship between temperature and the population growth rate of C. malaccensis is useful for predicting its population dynamics. Age-stage, two-sex life tables of the predator, C. malaccensis, reared on Acarus siro were constructed under laboratory conditions at 22, 24, 28, 30, and 32 degrees C, 75% relative humidity, and a 0:24 h (L:D) photoperiod. Increasing temperature shortened the development time of the immature stages. The complete generation time of C. malaccensis ranged from 11.10 d to 27.50 d. Life table parameters showed that 28 degrees C was the optimum temperature for the growth and development of C. malaccensis; populations could increase rapidly at this temperature. The highest net reproductive rate (R-0 = 290.25) and highest fecundity (544.52) occurred at 28 degrees C. Temperature significantly affected the intrinsic rate of increase (r), fecundity, and finite rate of increase (lambda). The values of age-specific fecundity (high to low) were 28 degrees C > 24 degrees C > 30 degrees C > 32 degrees C > 22 degrees C, while the values of age-stage-specific fecundity had the same trend.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4450		WOS:000528056000032	32178253

The aim of this study was to better understand the quality and quantity of available food resources and the feeding habits of salmon fry in nearshore waters. We examined stomach contents of salmon fry and the zooplankton community structure of the water column during salmon fry's coastal residence period (April and May) over four years in Yamada Bay, a coastal embayment of the Pacific Ocean in northern Japan. The mean water temperatures during study period were low in 2014 and 2013 (6.7 and 8.3 degrees C, respectively), and high in 2016 and 2015 (11.1 and 9.4 degrees C, respectively). Neocalanus plumchrus and Themisto japonica, typical cold-water zooplankton dominated the stomach contents of chum fry (except for 2016), however, they were not necessarily the most dominant in the water column, suggesting that chum fry selectively preyed upon these cold-water zooplankters. On the other hand, chum fry preyed primarily on decapod larvae in 2016 the warmest water year. Condition factor of chum fry were higher in cold-water years than those of warm-water years. Because these two cold-water zooplankton species are typically abundant in the Oyashio Current, the magnitude of Oyashio inflow may affect prey availability for chum salmon fry and their nutritional status. The relationship between the food environment at the coastal residence period of chum fry and the adult return rate after three years was also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The paper documents the model development and the thinking behind incorporating a newly available upwelling index, and observed fishing effort as important drivers of modeled ecosystem dynamics. The most sensitive predator-prey interactions were identified and vulnerabilities (of prey to predators) were estimated to improve model fit to field observations under each scenario. Sardine interactions with prey and predators were consistently found to be sensitive interactions in model fitting, accounting for at least 40% of the most sensitive trophic interactions in the southern Benguela modeled food web. Model fits to data were improved by a total of 85% reduction in sum of squares when upwelling effects on large phytoplankton availability to zooplankton and small pelagic fish was incorporated, geographic shifts in sardine distribution were captured by means of altered availability of sardine to predators, corresponding vulnerabilities of prey to predators were estimated, and an additional, small, hypothetical forcing function was fitted to small phytoplankton production. African penguin and Cape gannet fits to data series were improved by incorporating a recently published bird Food Availability Index, although model fits of several fish groups then deteriorated, emphasizing the need for additional empirical species-specific functional response studies. Attempts at fitting the full area model to either west coast or south coast time series did not improve overall model fits, highlighting limitations of the current non-spatialized model in describing coast-specific dynamics. This study shows promise in unraveling the observed dynamics of the Benguela upwelling ecosystem, and points to the importance of exploring spatially disaggregated approaches, in particular the new foraging habitat capacity of the Ecospace approach, to improve our understanding of processes whereby variability in upwelling influences dynamics of the Southern Benguela ecosystem. This is important in reconciling knowledge needed to manage fisheries and to protect marine biodiversity by means of ecosystem -based management in South Africa, and to advance management advice under future scenarios of climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2296-7745		WOS:000556192700001

Large coastal sharks can have wide migratory distributions but show fidelity to specific nursery habitats. Here we show evidence for nursery range expansion into Pamlico Sound, North Carolina by a marine apex predator, the Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Previous assessments have shown little to no use of estuarine North Carolina waters as nursery habitat by Bull Sharks from 1965-2011. Juvenile sharks were rarely captured in a fishery-independent gillnet survey conducted by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) from 2003-2011, but were present every year from 2011-2016. Juvenile Bull Shark presence in the Sound was strongly related to early summer temperatures and late summer salinities, which have increased in the estuary over the 13 survey years, and further evidence for increasing water temperatures in Pamlico Sound was found in a 45-year data set for the NCDMF estuarine trawl survey. These results suggest that increasing water temperature and salinity have allowed Bull Sharks to expand their nursery habitat. This shift will have unknown, but potentially strong, impacts on both the local ecosystem and interactions with humans.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			2045-2322			WOS:000430048000008	29662126

So far there is no stock management, and hitherto even the most basic information on population dynamics of this species is missing. Annual formation of internal shell growth bands visible by x-ray was confirmed by the stable oxygen isotope record in the shell carbonate that reflects seasonal oscillations in water temperature. A Gompertz growth function (SLinfinity = 208.84 mm, K= 0.211 year 1(-1) t(0) =5.496) fitted 142 pairs of size-at-age data (30 shells) best. Maximum individual production amounted to 26.8 g shell-free wet mass (SFWM) at 115 mm shell length. Based on a size-frequency distribution derived from commercial catches, annual mortality rate of Z. dufresnei was estimated to be 0.61 (+/-0.21) year(-1).									29	0	0	0	28	1	29			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000224527600008

We studied the thermotolerance of the ladybeetle Serangium japonicum Chapin (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), an important native predator of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) in China. Serangium japonicum eggs, first- and fourth-instar larvae, pupae, and adults were subjected to a range of high temperatures (36, 39, 42, 43.5, and 45 degrees C) at intervals between 15 and 720 min. Survival was compromised and declined sharply for all life stages at temperatures of 42 degrees C and higher. First instars were the least heat tolerant, and eggs were typically the most resistant. Egg predation by S. japonicum did not differ whether the adult beetles were subjected to either heat shock or starvation first. Heat shock treatments at 36 degrees C did not impede adult egg consumption, treatments at 39 degrees C crippled ladybeetle's egg consumption for 8 h following treatment but recovered predatory capacity within 24 h after treatment. However, treatments at 42 degrees C greatly impaired ladybeetle's predatory capacity. After experiencing heat shock at 39 and 42 degrees C, adults significantly increased the amount of time they spent resting, which is the probable cause of predation decline after heat exposure. These results demonstrate that short periods of extreme heat exposures have a detrimental impact on S. japonicum survival and predation, but the effect was dependent on duration and life stage. Overall, these findings can help predict population dynamics and success of biological control of whitefly by S. japonicum in a warming world.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000474290300010

J	Stewart, Christopher B.; Scharf, Frederick S.								Estuarine recruitment, growth, and first-year survival of juvenile red drum in North Carolina								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				137	4			1089	1103		10.1577/T07-176.1				JUL 2008	2008	For many marine and estuarine fishes, there is growing evidence that processes occurring during the juvenile life stage can contribute to determining the relative success of recruitment of annual cohorts into the fishery. We studied two consecutive annual cohorts of juvenile red drum Sciaenops ocellatus from estuarine arrival through age 1 in two estuarine systems of southeastern North Carolina. For age-0 cohorts, relative abundance generally peaked in mid to late fall, and fish were present in shallow-water habitats through December before presumably moving to deeper waters during winter. Reappearance of red drum in shallow-water habitats during spring occurred between late March and late April depending on spring warming rates. Considerable differences in relative abundance of age-0 red drum were observed between estuaries; such differences may be related to variations in estuarine hydrology and flushing rates, which probably affect larval delivery and distribution. Otolith-derived hatch date distributions indicated that red drum juveniles in North Carolina were produced between July and October; interannual differences (of up to 30 d) in peak spawning times were correlated with variable nearshore water temperatures during summer. Juvenile growth rates during fall ranged from 0.45 to 0.75 mm/d, and mortality rates were between 1.6% and 4.1 % per day; ratios of weight-specific instantaneous growth to instantaneous mortality were greater than 1.0 for all cohorts during their first fall. Both growth and mortality varied between estuaries and years, suggesting local-scale control of these vital rates. Discrete overwinter loss rates ranged from 35% to 67%, indicating that fall cohorts of juvenile red drum could be negatively affected by variable overwinter mortality.

A comparison of fisheries biological reference points estimated from temperature-specific multi-species and single-species climate-enhanced stock assessment models								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY				134				360	378		10.1016/j.dsr2.2015.08.001				DEC 2016	2016	Multi-species statistical catch at age models (MSCAA) can quantify interacting effects of climate and fisheries harvest on species populations, and evaluate management trade-offs for fisheries that target several species in a food web. We modified an existing MSCAA model to include temperature-specific growth and predation rates and applied the modified model to three fish species, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), from the eastern Bering Sea (USA). We fit the model to data from 1979 through 2012, with and without trophic interactions and temperature effects, and use projections to derive single- and multi-species biological reference points (BRP and MBRP, respectively) for fisheries management. The multi-species model achieved a higher over-all goodness of fit to the data (i.e. lower negative log-likelihood) for pollock and Pacific cod. Variability from water temperature typically resulted in 5-15% changes in spawning, survey, and total biomasses, but did not strongly impact recruitment estimates or mortality. Despite this, inclusion of temperature in projections did have a strong effect on BRP5, including recommended yield, which were higher in single-species models for Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder that included temperature compared to the same models without temperature effects. While the temperature-driven multi-species model resulted in higher yield MBPRs for arrowtooth flounder than the same model without temperature, we did not observe the same patterns in multi-species models for pollock and Pacific cod, where variability between harvest scenarios and predation greatly exceeded temperature-driven variability in yield MBRPs. Annual predation on juvenile pollock (primarily cannibalism) in the multi-species model was 2-5 times the annual harvest of adult fish in the system, thus predation represents a strong control on population dynamics that exceeds temperature-driven changes to growth and is attenuated through harvest-driven reductions in predator populations. Additionally, although we observed differences in spawning biomasses at the accepted biological catch (ABC) proxy between harvest scenarios and single- and multi-species models, discrepancies in spawning stock biomass estimates did not translate to large differences in yield. We found that multi-species models produced higher estimates of combined yield for aggregate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) targets than single species models, but were more conservative than single-species models when individual MSY targets were used, with the exception of scenarios where minimum biomass thresholds were imposed. Collectively our results suggest that climate and trophic drivers can interact to affect MBRPs, but for prey species with high predation rates, trophic- and management-driven changes may exceed direct effects of temperature on growth and predation. Additionally, MBRPs are not inherently more conservative than single-species BRP5. This framework provides a basis for the application of MSCAA models for tactical ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions under changing climate conditions.

J	Ward, DL; Bonar, SA								Effects of cold water on susceptibility of age-0 flannelmouth sucker to predation by rainbow trout								SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST				48	1			43	46		10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0043:EOCWOS>2.0.CO;2				MAR 2003	2003	We conducted laboratory tests to evaluate the effects of an abrupt 10degreesC decrease in water temperature on ability of age-0 flannelmouth suckers (Catostomus latipinnis) to escape predation by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile flannelmouth suckers (58 mm mean total length) were maintained at 20degreesC and introduced individually, without acclimation, into tanks containing a single adult rainbow trout (246 mm mean total length) at 10 or 20degreesC. Rainbow trout attacked suckers more often at 20degreesC, but were more likely to capture them at 10degreesC. Age-0 flannelmouth suckers experience an abrupt temperature decrease when they exit warm tributaries and enter cold hypolimnetic water released from Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. This temperature change might increase susceptibility of young flannelmouth suckers to predation by rainbow trout, which are abundant in the Colorado River in Glen, Marble, and Grand canyons.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0038-4909			WOS:000182043500005

Artemia nauplii were used as the food item. Number of newly hatched Artemia nauplii consumed by the larvae (from zoea II: to zoea VII, zoea I can metamorphose to zoea II without exogenous nutrition in about one day) was measured daily at four food concentrations (2, 5, 10 and 20 Artemia nauplii/ml) and mio temperature levels (25 C and 28 C). The experiment was conducted in 500-mL beakers with three replicates for each treatment. The results show that the shrimp consumed significantly more food at 28 C than at 25 C (P < 0.01). Ingestion rate increased with increasing food concentration in all larval stages and with larval development except for the lowest food level (2 Artemia nauplii/ml) where insufficient food supply limited the ingestion rate to around 35 Artemia nauplii/larva per d after zoea IV stage. The larval development rate was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the shrimp subjected to the two lowest food concentrations (2 and 5 Artemia nauplii/ml) in the 500-mL beakers. But in a separate experiment conducted in the 1,400-mL beakers, the results were reversed: both survivorship and development rate were significantly lower at the two higher food levels (6 and 12 nauplii/ml) than those at 3 nauplii/mL, lever. During molting period, ingestion rate decreased significantly, followed by a sharp rise to the normal rate the following day.									24	1	0	0	21	1	25			0893-8849			WOS:000072568400013

Species belonging to higher trophic levels must employ mechanisms to reduce it. One of these mechanisms is hatching asynchrony, with the eggs in a clutch hatching over a period of several days. Some authors have suggested it to be adaptive when food is unpredictable. However, these birds can also suffer associated costs. We tested whether a species with higher foraging efficiency avoid hatching asynchrony compared to its sister species. We studied hatching asynchrony and nestling provisioning in relation to food availability in sympatric populations of blue and great tits. For the first time, we show that sister species respond to food availability with different strategies. Blue tit feeding rates readily responded to the abundance of their main prey, and also reduced the impact of nestling size hierarchy on mean nestling weight, consequently increasing fledging rate. Our results suggest that levels of hatching asynchrony seem to be influenced by species-specific life history traits, as generalist foragers rely less on it. They also highlight the importance of multi-species approaches when studying the response of organisms to environmental unpredictability.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000388793700001	27892941	
J	BRANDT, SB; KIRSCH, J								SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODELS OF STRIPED BASS GROWTH-POTENTIAL IN CHESAPEAKE BAY								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				122	5			845	869		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0845:SEMOSB>2.3.CO;2				SEP 1993	1993	Fish growth rate potential is defined as the expected growth rate of a predator if placed in a particular volume of water having known physical and biological characteristics. We used the concept of fish growth rate potential to evaluate the seasonal and spatial growth patterns of striped bass Morone saxatilis across a midsection of the Chesapeake Bay. The growth rate potential of a 4-year-old (1.9-kg) striped bass was assessed by integrating spatially explicit field data on prey sizes, prey densities, and water temperature with a foraging model and a species-specific bioenergetics model of fish growth rate. Prey sizes and densities were measured bimonthly at a high spatial resolution along a west-east transect of the bay with a 120-kHz dual-beam acoustic system. Along the transect, the water column was divided by columns and rows into a grid of cells 30 m long and 0.5 m deep. Growth and foraging models were implemented in each cell to calculate expected striped bass growth rate. Two-dimensional (horizontal, vertical) spatial maps of striped bass growth potential showed strong seasonal differences, even though overall prey biomass was similar from month to month. Striped bass growth rates were highest during October and nil during August. Mean growth rate potentials across the bay derived from the spatially explicit model were lower in all months than estimates generated with cross-bay, spatial averages of prey density. We argue that such spatially explicit modeling is necessary for directly linking biological function to physical and biological structure and for predicting how spatial patterning and absolute scaling of the habitat affect fish growth rates and production.									85	0	0	0	74	0	85			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:A1993MJ44000018

Asplanchna usually predates ciliates, rotifers, cladocerans and sometimes even copepods, its predation may drive not only the ecological, but also the evolutionary dynamics of prey populations. In the present study, the life-table demography and the population growth of Asplanchna brightwelli were investigated at four temperatures (16, 20, 24 and 28 degrees C) using Brachionus angularis as prey at four densities (10, 20, 30 and 40 ind.mL(-1)). The results showed that temperature affected significantly all the life-table demographic parameters (age-specific survivorship and fecundity, average lifespan, life expectancy at hatching, generation time, net reproductive rate and intrinsic rate of population increase) and the population growth rate obtained from the population growth studies, prey density affected the generation time, the net reproductive rate, the intrinsic rate of population increase and the population growth rate, and the interaction between temperature and prey density affected the generation time and the population growth rate. Both the average lifespan and the life expectancy at hatching were the longest at 16 degrees C, the generation times were longer at lower temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C) and higher prey densities (30 and 40 ind.mL(-1)), the net reproductive rates were higher at lower temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C) and 20-40 ind.mL(-1) of B. angularis, and the population growth rates were higher at 20 degrees C under 20-40 ind.mL(-1) of B. angularis.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0003-4088	2100-000X		WOS:000346605600001

Pure species individuals showed a higher clearance rate (CR). Mytilus chilensis had a CR of 1.13Lh(-1), while M. galloprovincialis registered only 0.78Lh(-1). Also, pure taxa registered higher values (above 70%) of absorption efficiency when compared with hybrid individuals. Ammonia excretion in M. chilensis and M. galloprovincialis was 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively, while hybrids registered significantly lower values. Under these experimental conditions, M. chilensis registered the highest scope for growth (P<0.05), compared with M. galloprovincialis and their hybrids. However, the net growth efficiency index (K-2) in hybridization type I (fMgxoMc) was higher (P<0.05) than other experimental groups. The invasive mytilid M. alloprovincialis showed values that are very similar to those obtained with the hybridization I group (fMgxoMc). Finally, we discuss that water temperature is an important factor in the biogeographic separation of both species and the potential effects that the settlement of the invasive species may have for Chilean mussel production.									6	0	0	0	6	2	6			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000326615600001

However, mechanistic studies documenting changes in interactions across broad geographic ranges are limited. We surveyed predation intensity on common prey (live amphipods and gastropods) in communities of eelgrass (Zostera marina) at 48 sites across its Northern Hemisphere range, encompassing over 37 degrees of latitude and four continental coastlines. Predation on amphipods declined with latitude on all coasts but declined more strongly along western ocean margins where temperature gradients are steeper. Whereas insitu water temperature at the time of the experiments was uncorrelated with predation, mean annual temperature strongly positively predicted predation, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simply increased metabolic activity at the time of predation. This large-scale biogeographic pattern was modified by local habitat characteristics; predation declined with higher shoot density both among and within sites. Predation rates on gastropods, by contrast, were uniformly low and varied little among sites. The high replication and geographic extent of our study not only provides additional evidence to support biogeographic variation in predation intensity, but also insight into the mechanisms that relate temperature and biogeographic gradients in species interactions.									26	0	0	0	22	0	26			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000419240900004	29083472

Although the independent effects of numerous stressors on aquatic biota are well documented (e.g., exposure to environmental contaminants), fewer studies have examined how natural variation in the ambient environment modulates these effects. In this study, we exposed reproductively mature and larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to three environmentally relevant concentrations (14, 22, and 65 ng/L) of a common environmental estrogen, estrone (El), at four water temperatures (15,18, 21, and 24 degrees C) reflecting natural spring and summer variation. We then conducted a series of behavioral experiments to assess the independent and interactive effects of temperature and estrogen exposure on intra-and interspecific interactions in three contexts with important fitness consequences; reproduction, foraging, and predator evasion. Our data demonstrated significant independent effects of temperature and/or estrogen exposure on the physiology, survival, and behavior of larval and adult fish. We also found evidence suggesting that thermal regime can modulate the effects of exposure on larval survival and predator prey interactions, even within a relatively narrow range of seasonally fluctuating temperatures. These findings improve our understanding of the outcomes of interactions between anthropogenic stressors and natural abiotic environmental factors, and suggest that such interactions can have ecological and evolutionary implications for freshwater populations and communities.

Trade-offs that arise from this migration have already attracted much attention and the cold temperature in the hypolimnion is thought to be the main cost of this behaviour. In this study we additionally looked at the extra costs daphnids have from being exposed to a fluctuating temperature regime (cold during the day and warm during the night) which is less well studied until today. In our experiment Daphnia hyalina Leydig and Daphnia magna Straus either spent 24 h in constant warm water (19 degrees C), 24 h in constant cold water (12 degrees C), or spent 12 h in warm and 12 h in cold water in an alternating way (fluctuating temperature regime). We expected the values of the life history parameters of Daphnia in the fluctuating temperature regime to be exactly halfway between the values of the life history parameters in the warm and cold treatments because the daphnids spent exactly half of the time in warm water, and half of the time in cold water. Concordant with earlier studies our results showed that age at first reproduction and egg development time were reduced at higher temperatures. In the fluctuating temperature regime the values of both parameters were exactly halfway between the values at permanently warm and cold temperature regimes. In contrast, somatic growth was higher at higher temperatures but was lower in the fluctuating temperature regime than expected from the mean somatic growth rate. This suggests that a fluctuating temperature regime experienced by migrating daphnids in stratified lakes involves additional costs for the daphnids.									14	1	0	0	14	0	15			0018-8158			WOS:000231958400017		
J	Pakyari, Hajar; Enkegaard, Annie								Effect of different temperatures on consumption of two spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae, eggs by the predatory thrips, Scolothrips longicornis								JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE				12						98					AUG 13 2012	2012	Environmental variables such as temperature are important factors affecting the efficacy of biological control agents. This study evaluated the predation rate of the predatory thrips Scolothrips longicornis Priesner (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) against the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) under laboratory conditions. Based on daily and total prey consumption of different life stages of S. longicornis on spider mite eggs at temperatures covering the range suitable for development and survival of the predator (15 degrees C to 37 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH, 16:8 L:D), there was a significant effect of temperature on prey consumption. The number of prey consumed daily by first and second instar larvae increased linearly with increasing temperature from 15 degrees C to 37 degrees C, whereas daily consumption of preovipositing and postovipositing females was uninfluenced by temperature. Lower temperature thresholds for consumption by first and second instar larvae of S. longicornis was estimated to be 6.8 +/- 0.04 degrees C and 4.6 +/- 0.03 degrees C, respectively. The daily consumption of ovipositing females followed a nonlinear pattern, with maximum daily predation estimated at 32.8 degrees C. From the model used to describe consumption of ovipositing females, an upper threshold for consumption of 41.4 degrees C was estimated. The performance of S. longicornis at the different temperatures is discussed in relation to its practical use in integrated pest control programs.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			1536-2442	2250-2645		WOS:000307477100002	23425212	
J	Denlinger, JCS; Hale, RS; Stein, RA								Seasonal consumptive demand and prey use by stocked saugeyes in Ohio reservoirs								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				135	1			12	27		10.1577/T05-029.1				JAN 2006	2006	Community structure and species composition may be strongly influenced by predator-prey interactions resulting from and leading to episodes of population abundance or scarcity. We quantified diets of stocked saugeyes (female walleye Sander vitreus X male sauger S. canadensis) and estimated biomass of their primary prey, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, in three Ohio reservoirs at quarterly intervals during July 2002-July 2003 to determine whether saugeye consumptive demand could exceed the supply of available gizzard shad prey, resulting in a shift to alternative prey. We incorporated water temperature and saugeye diet composition, growth, and mortality into walleye bioenergetics models, which allowed us to compare estimated prey-specific consumption rates by saugeyes with gizzard shad standing stocks estimated with acoustics. Spring and summer were critical seasons. During spring, gizzard shad biomass was low, saugeye consumptive demand was low, and saugeyes consumed primarily alternative prey. During summer, when age-0 gizzard shad became available as prey, saugeyes consumed similar proportions of gizzard shad and alternative prey. Saugeye cumulative consumptive demand in summer was high and approached the gizzard shad standing stock. However, during fall and winter, gizzard shad supply was adequate to support high (fall) or declining (winter) saugeye consumptive demand. Across reservoirs and seasons, saugeyes consumed alternative prey to varying degrees, primarily sunfishes Lepomis spp., yellow perch Perca flavescens, logperch Percina caprodes, and minnows Pimephales spp. Seasonal asynchrony between saugeye consumptive demand and gizzard shad biomass during spring and summer indicated that a saugeye population with high survival, growth, and consumptive demand will opportunistically increase use of prey other than gizzard shad. The manner in which saugeye predation quantitatively influences these prey species could not be assessed. However, overexploitation of gizzard shad prey appears to be unlikely at current saugeye population sizes, particularly considering the opportunistic use of alternative prey and the high reproductive potential of gizzard shad.									20	0	0	0	19	0	20			0002-8487			WOS:000235381500002

Phenological synchronization disrupts trophic interactions between Kodiak brown bears and salmon								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				114	39			10432	10437		10.1073/pnas.1705248114				SEP 26 2017	2017	Climate change is altering the seasonal timing of life cycle events in organisms across the planet, but the magnitude of change often varies among taxa [Thackeray SJ, et al. (2016) Nature 535: 241-245]. This can cause the temporal relationships among species to change, altering the strength of interaction. A large body of work has explored what happens when coevolved species shift out of sync, but virtually no studies have documented the effects of climate-induced synchronization, which could remove temporal barriers between species and create novel interactions. We explored how a predator, the Kodiak brown bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi), responded to asymmetric phenological shifts between its primary trophic resources, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and red elderberry (Sambucus racemosa). In years with anomalously high spring air temperatures, elderberry fruited several weeks earlier and became available during the period when salmon spawned in tributary streams. Bears departed salmon spawning streams, where they typically kill 25-75% of the salmon [Quinn TP, Cunningham CJ, Wirsing AJ (2016) Oecologia 183: 415-429], to forage on berries on adjacent hillsides. This prey switching behavior attenuated an iconic predator-prey interaction and likely altered the many ecological functions that result from bears foraging on salmon [Helfield JM, Naiman RJ (2006) Ecosystems 9: 167-180]. We document how climate-induced shifts in resource phenology can alter food webs through a mechanism other than trophic mismatch. The current emphasis on singular consumer-resource interactions fails to capture how climate-altered phenologies reschedule resource availability and alter how energy flows through ecosystems.									34	0	0	0	28	0	34			0027-8424			WOS:000411704000051	28827339	
J	St-Pierre, Anne P.; Gagnon, Patrick								Effects of temperature, body size, and starvation on feeding in a major echinoderm predator								MARINE BIOLOGY				162	5			1125	1135		10.1007/s00227-015-2655-3				MAY 2015	2015	The common sea star, Asterias rubens, is a major predator in rocky subtidal ecosystems in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence and along the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Canada. We carried out two laboratory experiments to test the effects of water temperature, starvation, and body size, on mussel (Mytilus edulis) consumption and size selection in A. rubens from southeastern Newfoundland. Experiment 1 examined rates of consumption of medium (15-30 mm) mussels by small (9-15 cm) sea stars fed or starved moderately (for 3 weeks) at three temperatures representative of late summer highs (8, 11, and 15 A degrees C) and one temperature representative of late winter lows (2 A degrees C). Temperature and starvation did not affect consumption in summer, which was two times higher than in winter. Starvation also did not affect consumption in winter. Experiment 2 examined consumption of small (5-15 mm), medium, and large (30-45 mm) mussels by small and large (25-30 cm) sea stars fed or starved moderately or severely (for 6 weeks). Small sea stars consumed similar proportions of mussels regardless of starvation. However, large, moderately starved sea stars consumed at least two times more mussels than large, fed and large, severely starved individuals, indicating that the need to feed after a short starvation was higher in large than small A. rubens. Consumption of small, medium, and large mussels was, respectively, affected by the sea star's size only, size and starvation independently, and size and starvation interactively. Collectively, our findings indicate that starvation, body size, and their interaction are key modulators of feeding in A. rubens, while suggesting that feeding is adaptable to thermal conditions. They also speak of the importance of considering the interplay between organismal traits and ongoing changes in ocean climate to better predict causes and consequences of alterations in predator-prey interactions.									4	1	0	0	4	0	4			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000352798800018

Cultivation of the Marine Pelagic Tunicate Dolioletta gegenbauri (Uljanin 1884) for Experimental Studies								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					150					e59832	10.3791/59832				AUG 2019	2019	Gelatinous zooplanktons play a crucial role in ocean ecosystems. However, it is generally difficult to investigate their physiology, growth, fecundity, and trophic interactions primarily due to methodological challenges, including the ability to culture them. This is particularly true for the doliolid, Dolioletta gegenbauri. D. gegenbauri commonly occurs in productive subtropical continental shelf systems worldwide, often at bloom concentrations capable of consuming a large fraction of daily primary production. In this study, we describe cultivation approaches for collecting, rearing, and maintaining D. gegenbauri for the purpose of conducting laboratory-based studies. D. gegenbauri and other doliolid species can be captured live using obliquely towed conical 202 mu m mesh plankton nets from a drifting ship. Cultures are most reliably established when water temperatures are below 21 degrees C and are started from immature gonozooids, maturing phorozooids, and large nurses. Cultures can be maintained in rounded culture vessels on a slowly rotating plankton wheel and sustained on a diet of cultured algae in natural seawater for many generations. In addition to the ability to establish laboratory cultures of D. gegenbauri, we demonstrate that the collection condition, algae concentration, temperature, and exposure to naturally conditioned seawater are all critical to the culture establishment, growth, survival, and reproduction of D. gegenbauri.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1940-087X			WOS:000486589800076	31449255

Site quality, and the effect of environmental change, was measured as predicted overwinter survival. Dunlin had the highest prey biomass densities and were the least likely to be affected by reductions in their food supply, lower temperatures or loss of terrestrial habitats Black-tailed godwits and curlew had the lowest prey biomass densities and were the most likely to be affected by reductions in their food supply, lower temperatures and loss of terrestrial habitats. All five shorebird species were seriously affected by simulated sea-level rise. Conservation issues identified for the Poole Harbour SPA were the relatively low densities of larger size classes of polychaete worms, the importance of maintaining and managing surrounding terrestrial habitats and the effect of sea-level rise on the length of time for which intertidal food supplies are available.

Here we present the results of studies investigating factors contributing to higher mercury concentrations in fish in many of these lakes. Twenty-two percent of lake trout, 33% of northern pike, and 50% of walleye populations had mean mercury concentrations > 0.5 mu g/g, the guideline for the commercial sale of fish. Higher mercury concentrations were strongly associated with the relatively old age of MRB predatory fish; mean age ranged from 7.6 to 24.9 years for the three species. In contrast, none of the lake trout sampled in eight lakes further south in northern Saskatchewan and Alberta had mean mercury concentrations > 0.5 mu g/g; fish also were younger (mean age 6 years for the 8 lakes). Mercury concentrations in MRB fish generally increased with fish length, age, and trophic feeding although the nature of these relationships varied with the lake. Mean length was a good predictor of mean mercury concentrations in walleye populations across the study lakes but not for whitefish, lake trout, and pike; age was a good predictor for lake trout and walleye. Mercury concentrations in water and invertebrates were similar to those observed in more southerly regions where fish do not have elevated mercury concentrations. Mercury concentrations tended to be higher in fish in smaller vs. larger lakes and as a probable consequence of higher summer epilimnion temperatures, which favour a higher net methylation rate, and higher mercury and methyl mercury concentrations in water which enter these lakes from the watershed. Increasing fishing pressures on MRB lakes may be a means of reducing mean fish age, improving growth rates, and decreasing mercury body burdens. Increased global warming may result in higher mercury concentrations in fish through increased water temperatures, a longer ice free season, and increased release of stored mercury from the watershed into these takes.

Thermal activity thresholds of the predatory mirid Nesidiocoris tenuis: implications for its efficacy as a biological control agent								BIOCONTROL				55	4			493	501		10.1007/s10526-010-9267-0				AUG 2010	2010	This study investigates the thermal activity thresholds of the predatory mirid Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae) and two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). Adult N. tenuis lost locomotory function and entered chill coma at significantly lower temperatures (4.0A degrees C and 0.3A degrees C, respectively) than adult T. urticae (7.0A degrees C and 5.7A degrees C, respectively). However, the mirids were more adversely affected by high temperatures, with T. urticae losing the ability to walk and entering heat coma at higher temperatures (47.3A degrees C and 49.7A degrees C, respectively) than N. tenuis (43.5A degrees C and 46.6A degrees C, respectively). Across a range of temperatures (2.5-20A degrees C) adult N. tenuis had faster walking speeds than T. urticae. These data are discussed in relation to the climatic conditions under which N. tenuis would be an effective biocontrol agent.									18	0	1	0	19	0	19			1386-6141			WOS:000278810600006

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is distributed throughout southern China and has been investigated as a potential biological control agent against herbivorous insects in various agroecosystems. In the current study, we evaluated the preimaginal development, eclosion rate, reproduction, fertility, adult longevity, and prey consumption of C. sexmaculata under five temperature and five photoperiod regimens. The results showed that preadult developmental duration decreased significantly with increasing temperature and amount of daylight. Adult eclosion rate was highest at 35 degrees C and under conditions of complete darkness. Higher temperatures shortened the duration of copulation and preoviposition, prolonged the duration of oviposition, and increased the level of fecundity. Hatchability was highest at 30 degrees C. By contrast, the shortest copulation and oviposition duration and lowest level of fecundity and hatchability occurred with a completely dark photoperiod. Temperature and the gender of C. sexmaculata influenced adult longevity. In addition, there was a significant interaction effect of photoperiod and gender on adult longevity. Furthermore, prey consumption by fourth instar larvae and adult females both increased with increasing temperature and photoperiod. Our results reveal the high thermal and light sensitivities of C. sexmaculata, which highlight the importance of environment regulation in the mass rearing of this natural enemy for application as a biological control in agroecosystems in China.									18	2	0	0	18	0	20			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000329991200046	24498765

Zoological Studies 49(5): 625-631. Variations in the body weight of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus among 10 coastal regions of Lake Biwa and 11 lagoons of the lake were studied in Oct. 2005 and Oct. 2007, respectively. The body weights of fish with a normalized total length were estimated from length-weight relationships determined at each site. Body weights of bluegill from the lake and lagoons increased linearly with latitude. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between the calculated body weight and the number of sampled bluegill per unit time from the lagoons, implying that the population density of bluegill may strongly influence its growth in lagoons. Increasing numbers of submerged plants have covered the lake area in recent years, especially in the shallow southern basin. Moreover, as a predator of bluegill, the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides appears to flourish at higher densities in the northern basin of the lake than in the southern basin. These biotic factors seem to be somewhat responsible for the significant difference between the northern and southern basins in terms of the body weight of bluegill. However, water temperature and population density of the bluegill appear to be more directly responsible for the latitudinal variation in bluegill growth in Lake Biwa. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.5/625.pdf									8	0	0	0	9	0	9			1021-5506			WOS:000282297800005		
J	Dahlhoff, EP; Buckley, BA; Menge, BA				Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012				Physiology of the rocky intertidal predator Nucella ostrina along an environmental stress gradient								ECOLOGY				82	10			2816	2829		10.2307/2679963				OCT 2001	2001	To gain insight into suborganismal mechanisms underlying responses of predators to environmental stress, we examined the effects of temperature and food availability on the physiology and feeding activity of the predatory whelk Nucella ostrina (formerly N. emarginata). Studies were conducted in the mid-low transition zone on rocky reefs at two sites on the Oregon coast: Strawberry Hill (SH) and Boiler Bay (BB). SH is dominated by suspension-feeding invertebrates and their predators, while BB is dominated by macrophytes. In wave-exposed (EX) and wave-protected (PR) habitat,, at each site, we measured air and water temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and indices of physiological condition (malate dehydrogenase [MDH] activities and RNA: DNA ratios) for wild-caught whelks. The influence of food (+/- prey) and thermal conditions (+/- shelter) on prey consumption, physiological performance (oxygen consumption rate), and response to thermal stress (induction of Hsp70-class stress proteins) of whelks was determined in field experiments. Low-tide air temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and biochemical indices of whelk field condition were consistently different between sites (SH > BB) and wave exposures (temperatures: PR > EX, condition: PR < EX). Foraging activity, metabolic rates, and stress protein (Hsp) expression were consistently higher at SH than BB. Respiration rates were lower for all -prey treatments than for +prey treatments however, whelks in -prey +shade treatments had lower Hsp expression and higher respiration rates (an indication of better physiological condition) than whelks in -prey -shade treatments. Most measures of performance suggested that wave-exposed individuals were more physiologically robust than wave-protected individuals. Temporal physiological responses to stress suggested that high levels of heat stress compromise whelk performance later in the summer. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that physiological stress interacts with prey abundance to modify activity of whelks. Detailed studies of the effects of environmental stress on predator-prey interactions are needed to elucidate the relationship between physiological stress and predator-prey interactions. However, present evidence suggests that whelks alter activity (behavioral modification) and physiology (biochemical modification) in ways that lead to differential impacts by these predators on prey populations at different sites.									81	2	0	0	72	1	84			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000171863100012

Often, the effects of variation in streamflow on fish survival and growth can be difficult to estimate because of possible confounding with the effects of other variables, such as water temperature and fish density. We measured the effect of streamflow on survival and growth of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in a small stream in northwestern California by manipulating the flow entering four of eight enclosed strewn sections (9.0-15.3 m long) containing one pool and 2.5-4.0 In of upstream riffle habitat. In the four manipulated experimental units, we reduced inflow by 75-80% over a 6-week period in summer 2003. Flow diversion substantially decreased water velocity in riffle-pool transition areas but did not strongly affect habitat volume or water temperature. Fish in control units grew about 8.5 times as much as those in units with reduced streamflow; however, discharge manipulation did not affect survival, which exceeded 90% in both treatments. The input of invertebrate drift to pools within control units greatly exceeded the input into units with reduced streamflow; the concentrations of drifting invertebrates differed to a lesser extent between control and manipulated units. Managers concerned about salmonid populations in small streams should consider dry-season streamflow to be a key variable affecting fish growth.									90	1	0	0	87	0	95			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000240325200014

REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES				14	1			113	123		10.1007/s11160-004-2739-5				MAR 2004	2004	The anadromous Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) ( 4 runs) and steelhead ( rainbow trout, O. mykiss), are both native to California's Sacramento- San Joaquin River (SSJR) system, whose watershed encompasses the central valley of California. The SSJR system holds the southernmost extant Chinook salmon populations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, whereas coastal anadromous steelhead populations are found at more southerly latitudes. Populations of both species of anadromous salmonid have experienced dramatic declines during the past 100 years, at least partly from water impoundments and diversions on most central valley rivers and their tributaries. These changes restricted the longitudinal distribution of these salmonids, often forcing the superimposition of steelhead populations and Chinook salmon populations in the same reaches. This superimposition is problematic in part because the alterations to the river systems have not only changed the historic flow regimes, but have also changed the thermal regimes, resulting in thermally-coupled changes in fish development, growth, health, distribution, and survival. Given the highly regulated nature of the system, resource managers are constantly trying to strike a balance between maintaining or increasing the population size of anadromous fish runs and with other demands for the water, such as irrigation and water quality. To do so, in this review, we summarize the published information on the temperature tolerance and growth of the stream-associated life stages of these two valuable species, which are so central to the natural heritage of the State and its cultures. We show that many of these limits and growth-related effects are specific regarding life stage and that some may be specific to distinct strains or races of Chinook salmon and steelhead within the system. Because the number of published studies on the physiology of central valley salmonids was surprisingly low, we also use this review to highlight critical areas where further research is needed. Overall, this review should assist biologists and resource decision-makers with improved understanding for the protection and enhancement of these native fishes.									39	0	0	0	30	0	39			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000227515300005

To quantify the temperature dependence of biotic interactions and evaluate predictions of metabolic theory, we: 1) compiled a database of 81 studies that provided 112 measures of rates of herbivory, predation, parasitism, parasitoidy, or competition between two species at two or more temperatures; and 2) analyzed the temperature dependence of these rates in the framework of metabolic ecology to test our prediction that the activation energy,E, centers around 0.65 eV. We focused on studies that assessed rates or associated times of entire biotic interactions, such as time to consumption of all prey, rather than rates of components of these interactions, such as prey encounter rate. Results were: 1) the frequency distribution of E for each interaction type was typically peaked and right skewed; 2) the overall mean is E= 0.96 eV and median E= 0.78 eV; 3) there was significant variation in E within but not across interaction types; but 4) average values of E were not significantly different from 0.65 eV by interaction type and 5) studies with measurements at more temperatures were more consistent with E= 0.65 eV. These synthetic findings suggest that, despite the many complicating factors, the temperature-dependence of rates of biotic interactions broadly reflect of rates of metabolism, a relationship with important implications for a warming world.									23	0	0	0	20	0	22			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000345306600005

Whether the harsh conditions of anthropogenic habitat degradation can similarly reduce predation intensity and structure community dynamics remains largely unexplored. Oxygen depletion in coastal waters (hypoxia) is a form of degradation that has recently emerged as one of the greatest threats to coastal ecosystems worldwide due to increased rates of eutrophication and climate change. I conducted field experiments and surveys to test whether relaxed predation could explain the paradoxically high abundance of clams that have sustained a fishery in a degraded estuary with chronic hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia reduced predation on all experimental species but enhanced the long-term survivorship of only sufficiently hypoxia-tolerant prey due to periodic extreme conditions. As a consequence, only the harvested quahog clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) thrived in hypoxic areas that were otherwise rendered dead zones with depauperate diversity and low abundances of other species. This suggests that enhanced populations of some key species may be part of a predictable nonlinear community response that sustains ecosystem services and masks overall downward trends of habitat degradation.									51	0	0	0	48	0	51			0012-9658			WOS:000259995100015	18959318

In this study, foraging and non-foraging habitat were quantified monthly over an entire year for a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population in an isolated, headwater stream in southcentral New Mexico. The stream follows a seasonal thermal and hydrologic pattern typical for a Southwestern stream and was deemed suitable for re-introduction of the native and close relative, Rio Grande cutthroat trout (O. clarkii virginalis). However, uncertainty associated with limited habitat needed to be resolved if repatriation of the native fish was to be successful. Habitat was evaluated using resource selection functions with a mechanistic drift-foraging model to explain trout distributions. Macroinvertebrate drift was strongly season- and temperature-dependent (lower in winter and spring, higher in summer and fall). Models identified stream depth as the most limiting factor for habitat selection across seasons and size-classes. Additionally, positions closer to cover were selected during the winter by smaller size-classes (0, 1, 2), while net energy intake was important during the spring for most size-classes (0, 1, 2, 3). Drift-foraging models identified that 81% of observed trout selected positions that could meet maintenance levels throughout the year. Moreover, 40% of selected habitats could sustain maximum growth. Stream positions occupied by rainbow trout were more energetically profitable than random sites regardless of season or size-class. Larger size-classes (3, 4+) were energetically more limited throughout the year than were smaller size-classes. This research suggests that habitat in the form of deep pools is of paramount importance for rainbow trout or native cutthroat trout.									1	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000419982600006

Such information would be especially relevant with regard to prey physiology and resulting changes in prey stoichiometry. We investigated in Enallagma cyathigerum damselfly larvae the effects of a 4 degrees C warming (20 degrees C vs. 24 degrees C) and predation risk on growth rate, physiology and body stoichiometry, for the first time including all key mechanisms suggested by the general stress paradigm (GSP) on how stressors shape changes in body stoichiometry. Growth rate and energy storage were higher at 24 degrees C. Based on thermodynamic principles and the growth rate hypothesis, we could demonstrate predictable reductions in body C:P under warming and link these to the increase in P-rich RNA; the associated warming-induced decrease in C:N may be explained by the increased synthesis of N-rich proteins. Yet, under predation risk, growth rate instead decreased with warming and the warming-induced decreases in C:N and C:P disappeared. As predicted by the GSP, larvae increased body C:N and C:P at 24 degrees C under predation risk. Notably, we did not detect the assumed GSP-mechanisms driving these changes: despite an increased metabolic rate there was neither an increase of C-rich biomolecules (instead fat and sugar contents decreased under predation risk), nor a decrease of N-rich proteins. We hypothesize that the higher C:N and N:P under predation risk are caused by a higher investment in morphological defense. This may also explain the stronger predator-induced increase in C:N under warming. The expected higher C:P under predation risk was only present under warming and matched the observed growth reduction and associated reduction in P-rich RNA. Our integrated mechanistic approach unraveled novel pathways of how warming and predation risk shape body stoichiometry. Key findings that (1) warming effects on elemental stoichiometry were predictable and only present in the absence of predation risk and that (2) warming reinforced the predator-induced effects on C:N:P, are pivotal in understanding how nonconsumptive predator effects under global warming will shape prey populations.									24	0	0	0	22	0	24			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000367287900014	26909432

We examined the effect of long-term experimental warming on an aphid-sagebrush interaction (Obtusicauda coweni and Artemisia tridentata) in natural field plots in the Rocky Mountains. In no year did we find Support for the prediction that warming increased aphid abundance or Population growth. In fact, warming decreased aphid density on sagebrush in one year, tended to decrease aphids in a second year, and had no effect in a third year. In enclosures that excluded predators, warming decreased aphid population growth by an amount consistent with observed field density differences. Warming increased sagebrush carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio and plant size, but there was no significant correlation between these variables and aphid growth or density. In a separate snow-manipulation experiment in unwarmed plots, the timing of snowmelt did not affect aphid density. In conclusion, warming reduced or did not affect aphid density in each of three years, but this effect could not be explained by differences in plant size, bulk C:N ratio, predation, or snowmelt date. Our results suggest that long-term studies within a natural community context may provide counterexamples to the prediction that warming will increase herbivore pressure on plants.									22	0	1	0	21	0	23			0022-8567			WOS:000246784000007

The feeding rate on Clupeiformes (FRc) was substantially influenced by the path of the Kuroshio Current during early summer. We suggest that the following patterns occurred in the feeding habits of PBF. In 2012 and 2014, the short distance from the coast to the Kuroshio provided high overlap between PBF and Clupeiformes and increased the opportunity for feeding, and this pattern likely caused the observed diet shift from Crustacea to Clupeiformes by smaller PBF in the studied years than those in other years. In 2011 and 2015, the encounter probability for Clupeiformes might have been low due to the long distance to the Kuroshio Current, which led PBF to actively consume non-Clupeiformes Teleostei. In contrast, in August 2010 and 2015, PBF did not encounter Clupeiformes or other Teleostei and may have been forced to feed on a large number of Crustacea; this effect was likely due to high water temperatures. Despite the interannual fluctuation in the timing of the diet shift and the feeding intensity (FI), these factors did not contribute to growth in length; rather, they contributed to fatness. Considering size-dependent mortality in the larval stage, these results suggest that only fast-growing individuals survive, even if the feeding conditions drastically change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000471812800005

This study examined the effects of elevated temperatures on the movement and activity patterns of the common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), which is an important fishery species in tropical Australia and throughout the Indo West-Pacific. Adult fish were collected from two locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (23 degrees S and 14 degrees S) and maintained at one of four temperatures (24, 27, 30, 33 degrees C). Following >4weeks acclimation, the spontaneous swimming speeds and activity patterns of individuals were recorded over a period of 12days. At 24-27 degrees C, spontaneous swimming speeds of common coral trout were 0.43-0.45 body lengths per second (bls(-1)), but dropped sharply to 0.29bls(-1) at 30 degrees C and 0.25bls(-1) at 33 degrees C. Concurrently, individuals spent 9.3-10.6% of their time resting motionless on the bottom at 24-27 degrees C, but this behaviour increased to 14.0% at 30 degrees C and 20.0% of the time at 33 degrees C (mean +/- SE). The impact of temperature was greatest for smaller individuals (<45cm TL), showing significant changes to swimming speeds across every temperature tested, while medium (45-55cm TL) and large individuals (>55cm TL) were first affected by 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C, respectively. Importantly, there was some indication that populations can adapt to elevated temperature if presented with adequate time, as the high-latitude population decreased significantly in swimming speeds at both 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C, while the low-latitude population only showed significant reductions at 33 degrees C. Given that movement and activity patterns of large mobile species are directly related to prey encounter rates, ability to capture prey and avoid predators, any reductions in activity patterns are likely to reduce overall foraging and energy intake, limit the energy available for growth and reproduction, and affect the fitness and survival of individuals and populations.									52	0	0	0	48	0	53			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000332069500005	24277276

Climate change alters the seasonal pattern of emergence and abundance of invertebrate populations, which may have important consequences for the breeding performance and population change of insectivorous birds. In this study, we examine the role of food availability in driving behavioural changes in an insectivorous migratory songbird; the Eurasian reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. We use a feeding experiment to examine the effect of increased food supply on different components of breeding behaviour and first-brood productivity, over three breeding seasons (2012-2014). Reed warblers respond to food-supplementation by advancing their laying date by up to 5.6 days. Incubation periods are shorter in supplemented groups during the warmest mean spring temperatures. Nestling growth rates are increased in nests provisioned by supplemented parents. In addition, nest predation is reduced, possibly because supplemented adults spend more time at the nest and faster nestling growth reduces the period of vulnerability of eggs and nestlings to predators (and brood parasites). The net effect of these changes is to advance the fledging completion date and to increase the overall productivity of the first brood for supplemented birds. European populations of reed warblers are currently increasing; our results suggest that advancing spring phenology, leading to increased food availability early in the breeding season, could account for this change by facilitating higher productivity. Furthermore, the earlier brood completion potentially allows multiple breeding attempts. This study identifies the likely trophic and behavioural mechanisms by which climate-driven changes in invertebrate phenology and abundance may lead to changes in breeding phenology, nest survival and net reproductive performance of insectivorous birds.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			1932-6203			WOS:000381516100075	27467171

Copper and temperature modulate predator-prey interactions in larval dragonflies and anurans								ECOSPHERE				6	4					56	10.1890/ES14-00461.1				APR 2015	2015	Amphibians are important indicators of environmental health, and their populations are in worldwide decline. The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 mu g Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22 degrees C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17 degrees C). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments. We suggest that increased concentrations of dissolved copper and elevated water temperatures are harmful to amphibian prey through maladaptive behavioral responses in the presence of predators.									20	0	1	0	21	0	22			2150-8925			WOS:000354777300011

Annual, river-wide, capture-recapture data were used to document movements during a 5-year period (1991-1995). Average total length of Colorado squawfish progressively increased upstream: juveniles and subadults occurred almost exclusively in the lowermost 105 km of the 298-km study area, whereas most adults were concentrated in the uppermost 98 km. This was most pronounced early in the study and less so later due to the effect of two or three strong year-classes that dispersed through the system. Only 16% of subadult and adult fish initially captured and tagged in the upper reach were later located more than 10 km from the previous capture site; of those tagged in the lower reach, 58% were later located more than 10 km from the previous site. Most movements greater than 10 km were directed upstream, and many fish tagged in the lower reach moved to the upper reach; the smallest of these fish was between 421 and 449 mm in total length (TL) when it moved. No movement was detected from the upper reach to the lower. Distance moved was inversely related to fish size: displacement of fish shorter than 550 mm TL averaged 33.6 km; for those longer than 550 mm, average displacement was only 7.5 km. Movement of young adults may have been a response to changing food needs. Upstream movements placed fish into areas with greater availability of larger prey, and body condition of large adults during spring was significantly higher in the upper reach than in the lower reach. Water temperatures, however, were inversely related to adult distribution despite a preference for warmer water. We suggest that portions of the upper reach offer adults the best balance between food and water temperature.									29	0	0	0	28	0	29			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000078728600007

While each stressor alone has been studied in detail, their combined effects on the outcome of ecological interactions are poorly understood. We measured predation rates and predator selectivity of two closely related species of damselfish exposed to a predatory dottyback. We found temperature and CO2 interacted synergistically on overall predation rate, but antagonistically on predator selectivity. Notably, elevated CO2 or temperature alone reversed predator selectivity, but the interaction between the two stressors cancelled selectivity. Routine metabolic rates of the two prey showed strong species differences in tolerance to CO2 and not temperature, but these differences did not correlate with recorded mortality. This highlights the difficulty of linking species-level physiological tolerance to resulting ecological outcomes. This study is the first to document both synergistic and antagonistic effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on a crucial ecological process like predator-prey dynamics.									50	1	0	0	48	0	51			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000353220500009	25430991

Chronological approaches that relate time series of growth and climate information present the opportunity to identify important climatic drivers of demography and thereby understand the likely impact of climate change. We constructed otolith chronologies (a proxy for somatic growth) to examine synchrony of growth patterns within and between two mesopredatory fishes (Lutjanus bohar and L. gibbus) in the remote Chagos Archipelago, Indian Ocean. We then used mixed-model and pathway analysis to relate growth responses to a suite of climatic and environmental factors to determine the extent to which variation in inter-annual growth could be predicted at individual and population levels. Our models explained up to half the variance associated with annual growth at the level of populations. Significant environmental drivers of growth differed between species, as did the spatial scale of these drivers: L. gibbus exhibited a strong relationship with regional ocean temperature, whereas growth of L. bohar was correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, suggesting influential teleconnections between ocean basins as an underlying predictor of productivity of fish populations. Our results demonstrate that (1) synchronous growth stemming from relationships with climate factors may be suppressed at very low latitudes; (2) closely related species may respond to very different environmental stimuli; and (3) within the same environment, the scale of influential drivers may be local in nature or reflect oceanographic processes stretching across entire ocean basins. We demonstrate that biochronological approaches are effective tools for reconstructing relationships between climate variability and fish growth even in tropical regions where seasonality is low, and these methods can be valuable for forecasting population-level responses to projected climate change.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000513044300001

Through measuring standard length (SL) and sagitta microstructure analysis, it was estimated that the growth rate of E. ringens larvae decreased from June (0.85 mm day(-1)) to August (0.50 mm day(-1)). However, the water temperature was homogeneous during the sampling dates (14.6, 15.2, 14.4, and 14.6 degrees C), suggesting that the decelerating larval growth was not linked to changes in sea temperature. Additionally, larvae with slow growth have larger otoliths compared with con-specifics with fast growth (growth effect). Larval mortality rates tended to decrease until the middle of July (0.18 per day) but increased to 0.25 per day in early August, which coincided with lower food availability (i.e., chlorophyll-a, 2.7-5.6 mg m(-3)) and a high occurrence of smaller larvae (1.58-11.5 mm). Partial least squares analysis indicates low covariance between the biological and oceanographic variables (PLS: 11.71%), suggesting that other factors, such as parental effects, may explain the abrupt decrease in the larval growth rates.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000412425500001

Tag-recapture data from voluntary recreational fisheries programmes is an undervalued citizen science data resource and can provide valuable observation records for data-poor species. Here, we highlight the utility of such data by compiling four tag-recapture data-sets (n = 20 878 tags) to describe the movements and distribution of a piscivorous predator, tailor Pomatomus saltatrix, with respect to their environment. We compared species distribution models that explored a trade-off between temporal duration and spatial extent. Both models revealed sea surface temperature (SST) was an important factor in describing the distribution and density of tailor. However, the model with broader spatial extent indicated a non-linear response to SST, peaking at 21.5 degrees C, while the model with temporal longevity showed a linear SST response. This disjunct showcases the importance of building models across an adequate geographic extent to ensure covariate responses are not truncated. This is the first study to comprehensively describe the distribution and migrations of adult tailor across their eastern Australian distribution. The results are discussed in light of ocean warming along eastern Australia, and the subsequent implications for using tag-recapture data in fisheries management.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000448251200007

In this paper we focus on the effects of a combination of food types and feeding frequencies (i.e., the frequency with which the snails were offered food) on juvenile growth and survival at different temperatures. Offspring produced in the laboratory by wild specimens of M. cornuarietis, from Puerto Rico, were used to test the effects of three types of food (lettuce, alginate with fish food, alginate with snail mix) fed at three frequencies (given ad libitum on 4/4, 2/4, or 1/4 d) on juvenile survival and growth. The 4-d feeding regimens were repeated four times, giving a total of 16 d for the experiments. The experiments were conducted at two temperatures (22 degrees and 25 degrees C) under a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod. Juvenile growth rates increased with increasing feeding frequency for all food types. The most rapid growth rates occurred in the high-frequency lettuce treatments and the slowest growth rates in the low-frequency lettuce and alginate with snail mix treatments. Juvenile snails grew faster at 25 degrees than at 22 degrees C, and mortality was about twice as high at the lower temperature. Growth rates were used to provide a rough estimate of time to maturity, which was determined to take about twice as long at 22 degrees than at 25 degrees C. The results showed that lettuce is the best food if supplied in abundance, but effects on growth are very dependent on feeding frequency and temperature. We conclude that 25 degrees C is a more appropriate temperature for maintaining populations than 22 degrees C, that lettuce provides a suitable food source, and that food should be supplied continuously for husbandry and toxicity testing of populations of M. cornuarietis.									17	1	0	0	14	0	19			1077-8306	1744-7410		WOS:000237929800003	19009044

Here, we focus on the effects of abiotic factors such as nutrients and light (known to influence food quality) on grazer growth rates. As model organism we used the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum that is native to New Zealand but invasive elsewhere. In a stream channel experiment in New Zealand, we manipulated light (two levels) and nutrients (four levels) to achieve a range of primary producer carbon: nutrient ratios and added mudsnails (3 densities + ungrazed control) to 128 periphyton covered stream channels in a 2 x 4 x 4 full factorial design. We measured snail growth rate and activity, food quality and nutritional imbalance, to test the predictions that (1) less light and more nutrients increase periphyton food quality and thus snail growth rates, and (2) less crowding leads to higher food availability and thus higher snail growth rates. We found that snail growth rates were higher under low light than under high light intensities and this difference increased with increasing nutrient addition. These changes in growth rate were not mediated by food quality in terms of periphyton nutrient ratios. Furthermore, experimental treatments strongly affected snail behaviour. Snails grazed more actively in the low light treatments, and thus it is more likely that snail growth rates were directly affected by light levels, maybe as a result of innate predator avoidance behaviour or as a reaction to high UV intensities. We conclude that in our stream channels snail growth rate was limited by factors other than food quality and quantity such as UV exposure, algal defences or the relatively low ambient water temperature.									9	1	0	0	11	0	11			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000293914000009	21437650

Additionally, elevated CO2 can influence foraging and antipredator behaviour of marine organisms. Yet, how the availability of energetic resources may influence antipredator behaviour in an elevated CO2 environment is unknown. We tested the effects of food ration (low and high: 4 and 8% of body weight per day, respectively) on antipredator behaviour at ambient (489 mu atm) and elevated (1022 mu atm) CO2 in juvenile Amphiprion percula at 50 d post-hatching. Juveniles were from parents held at either ambient or elevated CO2, as parental exposure can influence phenotypic response in offspring. Antipredator behaviour was severely impaired by elevated CO2, with juveniles reared at elevated CO2 exhibiting no change in feeding rate in the presence of the predator cue compared with a > 67% reduction in feeding rate in ambient CO2 fish. By contrast, food ration had a minor effect on the change in feeding rate in response to the predator cue, with only a 2.3% difference between high and low food ration fish. The effect of elevated CO2 on antipredator behaviour of juveniles was not influenced by food ration. Parental exposure to elevated CO2 influenced the baseline feeding rate and exhibited a small carry-over effect in elevatedCO(2) juveniles. These results suggest that reef fish could exhibit riskier behaviour at elevated CO2 levels, regardless of the energetic resources available.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000422850500011		
J	Wong, YM; Moore, PG								Observations on the activity and life history of the scavenging isopod Natatolana borealis Lilljeborg (Isopoda: Cirolanidae) from Loch Fyne, Scotland								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				42	2			247	262		10.1006/ecss.1996.0018				FEB 1996	1996	The activity and life history of the cirolanid isopod Natatolana borealis Lilljeborg has been studied using (primarily) fish-baited traps deployed at a deep-water station (190 m) in Loch Fyne, Scotland. A voracious scavenger, it burrows into soft mud, emerging to feed when suitable food odours are detected in the water. Isopods were attracted significantly to baited vs. non-baited traps. Underwater video observations revealed that most animals were active in the vicinity of traps, that capture efficiency was low, but retention complete. Only traps on the sea-bed captured mancas or juveniles in any numbers. Any seasonal pattern in catch rate through the year was confounded by high variability. Only one (manca-)brooding female was ever caught in a trap (in April). It is assumed that brooding females desist from feeding. The sex ratio of isopods in most trap collections was thus significantly male dominated. Mancas were trapped during February to August. Growth rate was slowest in adults and was similar for males and females. The maximum growth rate occurred during autumn associated with the seasonal cycle in bottom water temperatures. Longevity was estimated (by following peaks in the size-frequency distributions with time) to be c. 2.5 years, with sexual maturity (based on oostegites/spurred appendix masculinae) achieved after c. 19 months. Semelparity is suggested. A low incidence of an unnamed epicaridean parasite is reported from the Clyde population. Natatolana borealis also carried peritrich ciliate epizoites on their antennae. Possible predators are swimming crabs and gadid fish, e.g. whiting and cod. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited									22	0	0	0	18	0	22			0272-7714			WOS:A1996TT42300008		
J	Solbreck, Christer; Knape, Jonas					Knape, Jonas/0000-0002-8012-5131			Seed production and predation in a changing climate: new roles for resource and seed predator feedback?								ECOLOGY				98	9			2301	2311		10.1002/ecy.1941				SEP 2017	2017	Climate change may cause changes in the dynamics of populations beyond comparatively simple directional effects. To better understand complex effects on dynamics requires long-term studies of populations that experience changes in climatic conditions. We study the dynamics of a seed-production-seed-predation system, consisting of a perennial herb and its two seed predatory insects, over a 40-yr period during which climate change has caused the annual growing season to increase by 20 d. During this period, plant patches have increased almost threefold in size and seed production has slipped into a pattern of alternate high and low years with a higher variance than in the beginning of the period. We find that seed production is associated with precipitation of the present summer and a non-linear feedback from seed production of the previous year. When previous year's seed production is low, weather forcing and unexplained noise determine the extent of seed production. When previous seed production is high, depleted resources limit seed production. Resource depletion happened frequently in the latter parts of the study but rarely in the beginning. The changing patterns of seed production in turn affect the dynamics of seed predation, which is dominated by one of the seed predators. Its dynamics are strongly linked to seed density fluctuations, but its population growth rate is satiated when resource fluctuations become too large. In the latter part of the study period, when seed fluctuations were alternating between years of high and low density, satiation was common and there was a large increase in surviving seeds in good years. Our study illustrates that a changing climate can fundamentally influence patterns of long-term dynamics at multiple trophic levels.									6	0	0	0	7	0	7			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000408836600009	28703294

S. leucopsarus exhibited an ontogenetic and seasonal dietary shift. In spring, small fish (<= 40 mm) preyed mainly on Neocalanus flemingeri/plumchrus whereas large fish fed mainly on Neocalanus cristatus. In summer, small fish preyed mainly on Metridia pacifica whereas large fish fed mainly on euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.). In the summer of 2003, when water temperature in the epipelagic layer (<= 100 m) was warmer, reflecting the prevalence of the Alaskan Stream, small-sized S. leucopsarus showed a higher stomach content index, perhaps reflecting the greater abundance of M. pacifica. Thus, the present study shows that the physical variability in the epipelagic layer affects not only diets but also feeding performance of micronekton.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			0916-8370			WOS:000253545400002

A number of conflicts and trade-offs exist in the harvesting of pelagic species, including (i) maximizing future food production given the depleted state of some stocks; (ii) minimizing bycatch of non-target species, (iii) setting ecosystem allocation rules for non-target top predators, such as seabirds, and (iv) maximizing value and livelihoods for local economies. Climate change can be expected to exacerbate some of these conflicts as the ranges of species and their habitats change over varying geographic, depth and temporal scales. Understanding the distribution of these impacts can be difficult due to the scarcity of observational data on species and ecosystems. Resolving all these conflicts is achievable with current approaches and technologies. Nevertheless, managing fishery production systems to provide fish for food security and conserving biodiversity will be particularly challenging.

J	Michaud, J; Fortier, L; Rowe, P; Ramseier, R								Feeding success and survivorship of Arctic cod larvae, Boreogadus saida, in the northeast water polynya (Greenland sea)								FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY				5	2			120	135		10.1111/j.1365-2419.1996.tb00111.x				JUN 1996	1996	We tested the hypothesis that enhanced feeding success and survivorship of Arctic cod larvae in the Northeast Water polynya (Greenland Sea) are associated with high densities of their zooplankton prey in areas of low sea ice concentration. From late May to early August 1993, first-feeding yolk-sac larvae (6.5-8.5 mm long) were collected primarily along the coast and over shallow banks in the polynya, whereas post yolk-sac larvae (8.5-14 mm) were more uniformly dispersed over the sampling area. Arctic cod larvae < 14 mm fed almost exclusively on copepod nauplii (74% of total prey number) and copepod eggs (16%). Feeding success was defined as the residuals of the regression of the number of prey ingested against larval length. Nauplii density varied from 9600 to 731300 nauplii m(-2) (equivalent to 0.16 to 12.2 nauplii l(-1)) but, contrary to our hypothesis, seldom limited the feeding success of Arctic cod larvae. Water temperature was the best predictor of feeding success in larvae of all sizes. First-feeding success and survivorship were low for larvae hatched before mid-July, and improved thereafter as surface temperatures increased in the open waters of the polynya. There was no relationship between feeding success and irradiance or wind. Assuming a fixed spawning season, it is concluded that a larger fraction of the newly hatched larvae would experience adequate temperatures in years when the polynya opens early. Based on this conclusion, we propose that the timing of the opening of polynyas is a critical determinant of year-class strength in Arctic cod, a key species in the Arctic food web.									50	0	0	0	38	0	53			1054-6006			WOS:A1996UT34300005

In this study, we determined the daily and total prey consumption of different life stages of Ty. bagdasarjani on Tetranychus urticae Koch nymphs at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C, relative humidity of 60 +/- 10% and a photoperiod of 16: 8 h (light : dark). The results showed a significant effect of temperature on food consumption by Ty. bagdasarjani. The number of prey consumed daily by protonymphs increased with increasing temperature from 15 (0.8 preys) to 25 degrees C (3.5 preys), and then decreased at 30 (2.8 preys) and 35 degrees C (3.1 preys). The daily predation of the other life stages of Ty. bagdasarjani followed a similar trend as that which occurred in protonymphs, with the exception of post-oviposition period, in which the highest values for the mean prey consumption were observed at 30 degrees C (6.6 preys/day). The highest means for the daily and total prey consumption of females were observed during oviposition, when they devoured an average of 2.7, 5.3, 10.1, 10.9, and 11.0 prey/day and 173.7, 255.9, 244.8, 259.0, and 185.8 prey in their entire period of oviposition at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C, respectively. During adult life, the maximum number of prey was consumed at 20 degrees C (432.7), which may be because of the longer period of adulthood at lower temperatures. Therefore, the efficiency of this predator in control of T. urticae populations could be higher at temperatures of above 20 degrees C.									21	1	0	0	19	0	21			0164-7954	1945-3892		WOS:000299877300009

Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.									44	0	0	0	35	0	45			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000370491400021	26599719	
J	Coley, PD								Possible effects of climate change on plant/herbivore interactions in moist tropical forests								CLIMATIC CHANGE				39	2-3			455	472		10.1023/A:1005307620024				JUL 1998	1998	The interactions between plants and herbivores are key determinants of community structure world wide. Their role is particularly important in lowland tropical rain forests where rates of herbivory are higher, plants are better defended chemically and physically, and herbivores have specialized diets. In contrast to the temperate zone, most of the herbivory in the tropics occurs on ephemeral young leaves (>70%), which requires herbivores to have finely tuned host-finding abilities. As a consequence of these tight ecological and evolutionary linkages, the interplay between plants and herbivores in the tropics may be more susceptible to perturbations of climate change.Increases in global temperature, atmospheric CO2, and the length of the dry season are all likely to have ramifications for plant/herbivore interactions in the tropics. Here I extrapolate from our current and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating plant/herbivore interactions and present a scenario for possible trends under a changing climate. Although elevated CO2 tends to enhance plant growth rates, the larger effects of increased drought stress will probably result in lower growth. In atmospheres experimentally enriched in CO2, the nutritional quality of leaves declines substantially due to a dilution of nitrogen by 10-30%. This response is buffered in plant species associated with nitrogen fixers. Elevated CO2 should also cause a slight decrease in nitrogen-based defenses(e.g., alkaloids) and a slight increase in carbon-based defenses (e.g., tannins). The most dramatic and robust predicted effect of climate change is on rates of herbivory. Lower foliar nitrogen due to CO2 fertilization of plants causes an increase in consumption per herbivore by as much as 40% and unusually severe drought appears to cause herbivore populations to explode. In areas where elevated CO2 is combined with drying, rates of herbivory may rise 2-4 fold. The frequency of insect outbreaks is also expected to increase. Higher herbivory should further reduce plant growth rates, perhaps favoring plant species that are well-defended or fix nitrogen. The predicted increase in the number of herbivores is primarily due to relaxed pressure from predators and parasitoids. Elevated temperatures may increase herbivore developmental times, affording them partial escape from discovery by natural enemies, and drought appears to decimate parasitoid populations. The expected decline in parasitoid numbers may be due to direct effects of dry season drought or to the relative scarcity of herbivores during that period. As a consequence, the relative abundance of species will change, and overall biodiversity should decline.

Depending on the temporal niche, organisms may benefit or suffer from changes in day length, thus potentially affecting phenological adaptation. We assessed the impact of day length changes on larvae of Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) and Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), both of which prey on aphids. Larvae of E. balteatus are night-active, whereas those of C. carnea appear to be crepuscular. We subjected both species in climate chambers to day lengths of 16 : 8 L : D and, to circumvent diapause responses, 20 : 4 L : D. We recorded development times and predation rates of both species. E. balteatus grew 13% faster in the 16 : 8 L : D treatment and preyed on significantly more aphids. In contrast, C. carnea grew 13% faster in the 20 : 4 L : D treatment and higher predation rates in 20 : 4 L : D were marginally significant. Our results show that day length affects development and predation, but that the direction depends on species. Such differences in the use of day length may alter the efficiency of biocontrol agents in a changing climate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000454835200016	28726267

Along temperate Atlantic shorelines, the isopod Idotea balthica from high latitudes are 53% longer on average than isopods from low latitudes. When reared at 6 degrees degrees--24 degrees degrees C, juveniles increased growth and development rates with temperature. Because the increase in growth rate with temperature outstripped increases in development rate, female size at maturity increased with temperature. This thermal sensitivity of growth cannot account for the latitudinal pattern in body size. Within temperature treatments, females from low latitudes reached sexual maturity at younger ages and at a smaller size than did females from higher latitudes. This shift in life-history strategy is predicted by latitudinal declines in predation pressure, which we tested using field-tethering experiments. Overall, isopods at low latitudes had a 44% greater mortality risk from daytime predators relative to isopods at higher latitudes. We conclude that a latitudinal gradient in predation risk, not temperature, is principally responsible for Bergmann''s rule in I. balthica. Increases in body size during future warming of oceans may be constrained by local patterns of predation risk.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000322901300008	23933725

Using the size of otoliths and pharyngeal bones, we showed that grebes mainly ate the younger age-classes (2-yr. old and younger) of Bleak (Alburnus alburnus), 80% of all fish prey. Monthly rates of Bleak consumption by wintering grebes were estimated by multiplying daily food intake, extrapolated from the relationship between food biomass intake and water temperature in the different winter months, with the proportion of Bleak in the diet and with the number of wintering grebes present each month. Great Crested Grebes were most numerous in the study area in January-February and there were no significant differences in numbers between the two winters. Size of Bleak eaten increased from November to February and the biomass of Bleak consumed was highest at the end of winter, when water temperature was lowest. Overall in the western basin, grebes consumed between 640 kg (conservative estimate) and 1,000 kg (maximum estimate) of Bleak per winter, which corresponded to 10% to 20% of the annual commercial Bleak harvest in that area. We suggest that grebe predation on Bleak might increase the mortality rates in the younger age-classes of the fish, and thus contribute to a decrease in the stock, but that economic impact of grebe predation on gross annual income from the local fishery is negligible.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			1524-4695			WOS:000183409300012

Together, these two threats are likely to present surprises centered around the zero-degree isotherm because the phase change of water has enormous potential to affect contaminant transport and transfer, and biological distribution and stress. Particularly at risk are top aquatic predators, migratory species, and species narrowly adapted to ice. These species are most exposed to contaminants, are most likely to become stressed by climate change, or contain within their life cycles efficient vectors of contaminants and diseases. In the Arctic, mercury presents a special case where risks can be altered at many places in the biogeochemical cycle. Atmospheric mercury depletion events offer one such location; however, the methylation of mercury in aquatic systems appears a far more important and presently neglected component of risk from mercury to Arctic ecosystems. Climate variables alter transport, transfer, and capture of contaminants. Therefore, monitoring for contaminants must be conducted with a systems approach that includes climate-related factors. To ensure that the perception of risk is accurate and that priority risks are addressed first, a closer dialogue between scientists, the public, and public administers is urgently required.									20	0	0	0	17	0	21			1080-7039	1549-7860		WOS:000233967700004		
J	Comyns, BH; Shaw, RF; Lyczkowski-Shultz, J								Small-scale spatial and temporal variability in growth and mortality of fish larvae in the subtropical northcentral Gulf of Mexico: implications for assessing recruitment success								FISHERY BULLETIN				101	1			10	21						JAN 2003	2003	Extensive plankton collections were taken during seven September cruises (1990-93) along the inner continental shelf of the northcentral Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Despite the high productivity and availability of food during these cruises, significant smallscale spatial variability was found in larval growth rates for both Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Carangidae) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens, Lutjanidae). The observed variability in larval growth rates was not correlated with changes in water temperature or associated with conspicuous hydrographic features and suggested the existence of less-recognizable regions where conditions for growth vary. Cruise estimates of mortality coefficients (Z) for larval Atlantic bumper (n=32,241 larvae from six cruises) and vermilion snapper (n= 2581 larvae from four cruises) ranged from 0.20 to 0.37 and 0.19 to 0.29, respectively. Even in a subtropical climate like the GOM, where larval-stage durations may be as short as two weeks, observed variability in growth rates, particularly when combined with small changes in mortality rates, can cause order-of-magnitude differences in cumulative larval survival. To what extent the observed differences in growth rates at small spatial scales are fine-scale "noise" that ultimately is smoothed by larger-scale processes is not known. Future research is needed to further characterize the small-scale variability in growth rates of larvae, particularly with regard to microzooplankton patchiness and the temporal and spatial pattern of potential predators. Small-scale spatial variability in larval growth rates may in fact be the norm, and understanding the implications of this subtle mosaic may help us to better evaluate our ability to partition the causes of recruitment variability.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0090-0656	1937-4518		WOS:000180494100002

Within the 4 regional domains that were covered in the study (continental slope, continental shelf, outer sill region, and main fjord basin), salty coastal water and glacial runoff mixed to various extents, and 7 water masses with specific characteristics were identified. The common large copepod species were Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus, and Metridia longa. Small copepod genera included Microsetella, Pseudocalanus, and Oithona, while rotifers and gastropods (primarily pteropods) were also found in high abundance. Species could be linked to the specific water masses, e.g. Calanus spp. were primarily associated with oceanic or coastal waters, whereas M. longa, Microsetella sp., Pseudocalanus sp., and rotifers were mostly found inside the fjord. The combined biomass of the large zooplankton species (5.5 x 10(3) mg C m(-2)) was less than that of the small species (6.8 x 10(3) mg C m(-2)) averaged across all sampled stations along the transect. Estimated in situ grazing rates for the large copepod species were <10% of their maximum rates, indicating food limitation. The major predatory zooplankton groups, Pareuchaeta norvegica and chaetognaths, had estimated predation effects of <1% d(-1) on the prey community. The dominance of small zooplankton species within the fjord contradicts the traditional emphasis on large, lipid-rich zooplankton species in the arctic seas, and suggests that the planktonic food web structure inside the glacial fjord was different from that of the system outside.									30	1	0	0	25	0	31			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000293532900007

Biological time series data are thus urgently needed for the world's oceans. Here, we use the carbon stable isotope composition of tuna to provide a first insight into the existence of global trends in complex ecosystem dynamics and changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. From 2000 to 2015, considerable declines in delta C-13 values of 0.8 parts per thousand-2.5 parts per thousand were observed across three tuna species sampled globally, with more substantial changes in the Pacific Ocean compared to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Tuna recorded not only the Suess effect, that is, fossil fuel-derived and isotopically light carbon being incorporated into marine ecosystems, but also recorded profound changes at the base of marine food webs. We suggest a global shift in phytoplankton community structure, for example, a reduction in C-13-rich phytoplankton such as diatoms, and/or a change in phytoplankton physiology during this period, although this does not rule out other concomitant changes at higher levels in the food webs. Our study establishes tuna delta C-13 values as a candidate essential ocean variable to assess complex ecosystem responses to climate change at regional to global scales and over decadal timescales. Finally, this time series will be invaluable in calibrating and validating global earth system models to project changes in marine biota.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000495485400001	31578765

Influences of dissolved oxygen on juvenile largemouth bass foraging behaviour								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				27	2			559	569		10.1111/eff.12370				APR 2018	2018	Summer stratification often leads to large areas of hypolimnetic hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs. These areas of hypoxia alter fish behaviours and distributions as well as restrict access to valuable prey resources, yet few studies have examined foraging behaviour of fish in response to low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. We observed foraging behaviour of juvenile largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, in response to varying DO concentrations in tanks that simulated a stratified lake water column during the summer: 28 degrees C oxygenated epilimnion, 15 degrees C deoxygenated hypolimnion. Compared with saturated concentrations (8.0-9.0mg/L), hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations of 3.0mg/L and 1.5mg/L resulted in a drastic decrease in prey consumption, handling efficiency and time spent below the thermocline mainly due to avoidance behaviour of hypoxic conditions. However, we found at high hypolimnetic prey densities, individual fish were more willing to venture into reduced oxygen concentrations. Several unique behaviours including transporting prey above the oxycline for consumption, aquatic surface respiration and gill flaring were employed by largemouth bass foraging in low oxygen environments. Reduced hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations may influence and alter feeding strategies, especially for fish that rely on benthic prey resources.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000426610900005

Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations < 2 mg L-1. However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.									16	0	0	0	10	0	16				2296-7745		WOS:000462731700001

Sixteen salmon sharks were tagged with satellite transmitters and 246 with conventional tags following capture, and were then released in Prince William Sound during summer 1999 to 2001. Most salmon sharks sexed during the study were female (95%), suggesting a high degree of sexual segregation in the region. Salmon sharks congregated at adult Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. migration routes and in bays near Pacific salmon spawning grounds in Prince William Sound during July and August. Adult Pacific salmon were the principal prey in 51 salmon shark stomachs collected during summer months in Prince William Sound, but the fish appeared to be opportunistic predators and consumed sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, gadids, Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, rockfish Sebastes spp. and squid (Teuthoidea) even when adult Pacific salmon were locally abundant. As Pacific salmon migrations declined in late summer, the salmon sharks dispersed; some continued to forage in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska into autumn and winter months, while others rapidly moved south-east thousands of kilometres toward the west coasts of Canada and the U.S. Three movement modes are proposed to explain the movement patterns observed in the Gulf of Alaska and eastern North Pacific Ocean: 'focal foraging' movements, 'foraging dispersals' and 'direct migrations'. Patterns of salmon shark movement are possibly explained by spatio-temporal changes in prey quality and density, an energetic trade-off between prey availability and water temperature, intra-specific competition for food and reproductive success. Transmissions from the electronic tags also provided data on depth and water temperatures experienced by the salmon sharks. The fish ranged from the surface to a depth of 668 m, encountered water temperatures from 4(.)0 to 16(.)8 degrees C and generally spent the most time above 40 m depth and between 6 and 14 degrees C (60 and 73%, respectively).

Mean individual body size should therefore decline, which also implies a loss of biomass at higher trophic levels. If resources are plentiful and easily assimilated, however, the required to persist in warmer environments may be attained, leading to faster growth rates and an overall increase in the biomass of apex predators. Here, we investigated the response of different trophic groups to increasing temperature in a system of geothermal streams in Iceland, exposed to a temperature gradient of 5-21 degrees C. These streams provide an ideal natural experiment for isolating the effects of warming in multispecies systems, as they have broadly similar geographical and physicochemical features. The macrophyte cover increased significantly with increasing stream temperature, suggesting a greater resource pool for macroinvertebrates (either through direct grazing or feeding on epiphytes). This was reflected by a greater number of generations in 1 year among macroinvertebrates: species in the coldest streams were either uni- or bivoltine, while those in the warmer streams were mostly bivoltine or multivoltine. Differences in phenology were also seen among streams, with emergence of adults limited mostly to the summer months in the colder streams, but occurring year-round in the warmer streams. Macroinvertebrates also grew faster with increasing temperature, contributing to greater population biomass and secondary production in the warmer streams. This increase in prey availability likely produced more favourable conditions for top predators in the warmer streams, leading to an increasing biomass of brown trout with increasing temperature. These findings suggest that warming does not necessarily favour the small in aquatic ecosystems, with high-resource availability, faster reproductive and growth rates and greater production all contributing to meet the high-metabolic demands of apex predators in warmer environments.									26	0	0	0	22	0	27			0065-2504		978-0-12-417210-4; 978-0-12-417199-2	WOS:000326098900006

Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how natural selection may shape the genetics of phenotypic plasticity to produce patterns of geographic variation and phenotypic evolution. Because the covariance between genetic and environmental influences can modulate the expression of phenotypic variation, a complete understanding of geographic variation requires determining whether these influences covary in the same (cogradient variation) or in opposing (countergradient variation) directions. We focus on marine snails from rocky intertidal shores as an ideal system to explore how genetic and plastic influences contribute to geographic and historical patterns of phenotypic variation. Phenotypic plasticity in response to predator cues, wave action, and water temperature appear to exert a strong influence on small and large-scale morphological variation in marine snails. In particular, plasticity in snail shell thickness: (i) may contribute to phenotypic evolution, (ii) appears to have evolved across small and large spatial scales, and (iii) may be driven by life history trade-offs tied to architectural constraints imposed by the shell. The plasticity exhibited by these snails represents an important adaptive strategy to the pronounced heterogeneity of the intertidal zone and undoubtedly has played a key role in their evolution.									77	0	0	0	73	1	78			0016-6707	1573-6857		WOS:000173029400020	11838773

However, species distributions are determined by both abiotic conditions and biotic interactions with other species in the community. Therefore, climate change is expected to impact species through direct effects on their physiology and indirect effects propagated through their resources, predators, competitors, or mutualists. Furthermore, the sign and strength of species interactions can change according to abiotic conditions, resulting in context-dependent species interactions that may change across space or with climate change. Here, we incorporated the context dependency of species interactions into a dynamic species distribution model. We developed a multi-species model that uses a time-series of observational survey data to evaluate how abiotic conditions and species interactions affect the dynamics of three rocky intertidal species. The model further distinguishes between the direct effects of abiotic conditions on abundance and the indirect effects propagated through interactions with other species. We apply the model to keystone predation by the sea star Pisaster ochraceus on the mussel Mytilus californianus and the barnacle Balanus glandula in the rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific coast, USA. Our method indicated that biotic interactions between P. ochraceus and B. glandula affected B. glandula dynamics across >1000 km of coastline. Consistent with patterns from keystone predation, the growth rate of B. glandula varied according to the abundance of P. ochraceus in the previous year. The data and the model did not indicate that the strength of keystone predation by P. ochraceus varied with a mean annual upwelling index. Balanus glandula cover increased following years with high phytoplankton abundance measured as mean annual chlorophyll-a. M. californianus exhibited the same pattern to a lesser degree, although this pattern was not significant. This work bridges the disciplines of biogeography and community ecology to develop tools to better understand the direct and indirect effects of abiotic conditions on ecological communities.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000406594300014	28881933	
J	Wang, Ying-Jie; Stoks, Robby; Sentis, Arnaud; Tuzun, Nedim								Support for the climatic variability hypothesis depends on the type of thermal plasticity: lessons from predation rates								OIKOS				129	7			1040	1050		10.1111/oik.07181				JUL 2020	2020	Plastic and evolutionary changes in traits related to biotic interactions are crucial for the local persistence of populations under global warming. Yet, how acute and developmental thermal plasticity evolve and shape predation rates has been poorly studied, especially in the context of latitude-driven thermal evolution. A powerful predictive framework is given by the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) stating that thermal plasticity and acclimation capacity evolve to be higher in high-latitude populations because these are exposed to higher thermal seasonal variability. We tested the CVH for predation rates and evaluated if the support for the CVH depended on the type of plasticity and acclimation metric. We examined effects of developmental temperature (20 and 24 degrees C) and acute changes in mean and extreme temperatures (20, 24 and 32 degrees C) on the predation rates of high- and low-latitude populations of a predatory aquatic insect, the damselflyIschnura elegans. We documented opposing and interactive effects between developmental and acute temperatures, which urges caution when using thermal performance curves to forecast the impact of global warming on biotic interactions. Predation rates were higher in low-latitude than high-latitude predators, especially at the warmer developmental and test temperatures, suggesting thermal adaptation to the higher low-latitude temperatures. The latitudinal patterns in acute and developmental plasticities differed, providing mixed support for the CVH. Moreover, there was no latitudinal pattern in post-acclimation thermal sensitivity, indicative of perfect thermal compensation in predators from both latitudes. Strikingly, the acclimation capacity leading to perfect thermal compensation was ~6 times higher in high-latitude than in low-latitude predators. Our study provides new insights into the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) by documenting that its support is critically dependent on the type of plasticity and acclimation metric used.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000544487100008

A total of 41 species was found in the estuary, with decreasing numbers of species with decreasing distance from the thermal outfall. Cluster analyses and multi-dimensional scaling ordination separated the thermally polluted sites from the non-affected sites. During the summer/autumn period, thermal effluent only affected water temperature and the species compositions in the inner estuary, and the estuary-opportunistic species Aldrichetta forsteri, Arripis georgiana, A. truttacea and Hyporhamphus melanochir avoided the area at this time. During winter/spring months, thermal effluent acted in the opposite way, with A. forsteri attracted to the warmer waters of the inner estuary. The extended growth season for this species and significantly higher growth rates promoting premature movement out of the inner estuary for S. punctata were additional direct effects. These latter effects may alter the population structures of these species by increasing their vulnerability to heavy localized fishing intensity, aggregation of natural predators and point-source pollution. The species composition of the fish fauna of the estuary may also be indirectly affected by the thermal pollution-mediated seagrass loss in the inner estuary and a method is described to test this hypothesis.									27	0	0	0	25	0	28			1323-1650			WOS:A1996VP33300003

It is unknown how pest populations and predator efficacy may respond in these farming systems as global temperatures increase. To test these questions, we placed enclosures in eight alfalfa fields farmed using conventional (n = 4) or organic (n = 4) practices for 25 years. We stocked enclosures with pea aphids and 0, 2, or 4 predaceous ladybeetles. Half of the enclosures per field were then either left at ambient temperature or plastic-wrapped to warm them by 2 degrees C. Aphid abundances were similar in conventional and organic fields under ambient conditions, but were significantly more abundant in conventional than in organic fields when enclosures were warmed. Predator efficacy was reduced under low predator abundance (Hippodamia convergens = 2) in conventional fields under warming conditions; predation strength in organic fields was unaffected by warming. Alfalfa biomass increased with increased predators in all farming and temperature treatments. Our study suggests that biological control may be more easily maintained in organic than in conventional systems as global temperature increases.									6	0	0	0	6	1	6			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000406594300011	28460041

Indirect effects may include non-additive interactions with density dependence. Detection of climate drivers is critical to predicting climate change effects, but identification of potential drivers may depend on knowing the underlying mechanisms. For the butterfly Speyeria mormonia, one climate driver, snow melt date, has multiple effects on population growth. Snow melt date in year t has density-dependent indirect effects. Through frost effects, early snow melt decreases floral resources, thence per-capita nectar availability, which determines fecundity in the lab. Snow melt date in year t + 1 has density-independent direct effects. These effects explain 84% of the variation in population growth rate. One climate parameter thus has multiple effects on the dynamics of a species with non-overlapping generations, with one effect not detectable without understanding the underlying mechanism.									99	2	0	0	87	0	100			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000302288900013	22414183

Climate change is both affecting temperature forcings and water regime. Mathematical models are set up to investigate the mechanisms for the change of temporal patterns in aquatic invertebrates as brought about by climate change.Based on temperature data from rivers in Northern Germany a stochastic time series model was set up. This model combines a deterministic seasonal trend, a long term linear trend and an ARMA model for the stochastic component. The model is used to generate input temperature data for population dynamic models. Based on the scenarios for climate change of the IPCC, both an elevation of temperature and alterations of parameters of the stochastic process were taken into account.Biological populations are structured by age, size and stage. Two mathematical approaches were employed. For the simulation of long term time patterns in dragonfly populations, a projection matrix model is devised, i.e. the life cycle graph is mapped into a population matrix. The model yields emergence curves of larvae and adults. Figure 1 shows a simulation example of the projection matrix model. For the simulation of the time course of length density distributions of Gammarus pulex, a partial differential equation was employed. Transition probabilities and growth rates were devised as a function of temperature. The models are applied to the population dynamics of two common lotic invertebrates, a dragonfly (Gomphus vulgatissimus) and an amphipod (Gammarus pulex).Most global change scenarios predict temperature rises especially in higher latitudes affecting the north-south temperature gradient. The model predicts that indications of global change should imply both a shift of geographical extension of G. vulgatissimus and a shift to longer cycle lengths to higher latitudes.[GRAPHICS]The emergence of temporal patterns and the synchronizing effect of temperature forcing are studied in a model system comprising a predator and a prey population which are under the control of different timers.

We conducted a laboratory experiment in which Atlantic bluefin tuna larvae were offered larval prey for the first time at different ages to simulate the early onset of piscivory at three treatments: yolk-sac larvae (YSL), delayed onset of piscivory (DYSL) and a solely planktivorous diet (Rotifers). The otolith microstructure was then used to compare the larval size distribution at the onset of the experiment with the estimated previous size-at-age of the survivors at the end of the experiment by back-calculation. Within a cohort, our results show size-selective mortality of the largest larvae independent of the differences in the timing of onset of piscivory and differences in growth patterns. The results also corroborate the rapid response of Atlantic bluefin tuna to piscivory in terms of growth reflected in the otolith increment widths. Being bigger did not infer a survival advantage and mortality rates did not decline with increasing larval size. Smaller size at a given age could under certain conditions and stages of development confer a survival advantage of individual members of a larval cohort when suitable small-sized prey is available.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000449132600005

Planktonic bully larvae first appeared in appreciable numbers in January. By February, they formed a scattering layer between depths of 12 to 24 m during the day, where they achieved a maximum density of 0.59 fish m(-3). Larger (> 18mm) fish migrated to the littoral zone and densities declined to < 0.01 fish m(-3) by July, when remaining larval fish occupied greater daytime depths. Their vertical distribution during the day appeared to be influenced mainly by light levels and water temperatures. Larvae grew more slowly (0.12 mm d(-1)) than in more productive North Island lakes, and were also present in lower densities for a more restricted period of time. Koaro larvae first appeared in November and December and were found in low numbers (< 0.01 fish m(-3)) in summer at depths of 10 to 26 m. Salmonid production in the limnetic zone is probably limited by the small size and relative scarcity of forage fish present.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0018-8158			WOS:000086541800004

Here, we show that exposure to elevated temperatures significantly affected the predator-prey interactions of a pair of common reef fish, the planktivorous damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi) and the piscivorous dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus). When predators exposed to elevated temperatures interacted with prey exposed in a similar manner, maximal attack speeds increased. This effect coupled with decreasing prey escape speeds and escape distances led to increased predation rates. Prey exposed to elevated temperatures also had decreased reaction distances and increased apparent looming threshold, suggesting that their sensory performance was affected. This occurred despite the increase in maximal attack speeds, which in other species has been shown to increase reaction distances. These results suggest that the escape performance of prey is sensitive to short-term increases in ambient temperature. As marine environments become more thermally variable in the future, our results demonstrate that some predators may become more successful, suggesting that there will be strong selection for the maintenance of maximal escape performance in prey. In the present era of rapid climate change, understanding how changes to individual performance influence the relationships between predators and their prey will be increasingly important in predicting the effects of climate change within ecosystems.									40	0	0	0	39	0	40			2051-1434			WOS:000375196000001	27293696	
J	CHAABANE, K; JOSENS, G; LOREAU, M								QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF CONSUMPTION BY ABAX ATER VILLERS (COLEOPTERA, CARABIDAE)								PEDOBIOLOGIA				37	5			291	302						SEP 1993	1993	Food ingestion by Abax ater was measured in the laboratory under fluctuating summer conditions: day/night = 16 h/8 h, 18 C/15 degrees C, humidity at saturation. During their 7 months' development, larvae ingested 2340 mg (FW) of pre-digested earthworm flesh before their pupal moulting. Adult consumption was partly measured and partly estimated. Young emerging imagoes fed on ground beef meat consumed about 5740 mg (FW) during their first year (7 months) of activity. Older hibernated imagoes consumed 3850 to 5350 mg (FW) during the same time lapse. When fed on earthworms, their consumption was about twice higher. Adult consumption was zero at temperatures below 6 degrees C and reached its maximum value at 15 degrees C. At this temperature, gut clearance required 4-8 days but more than 50% of gut emptying was attained after 48 hours. These data are a first step towards an energy budget for Abax ater. Although the daily consumption rates (7 - 10% of individual weight) are by far lower than those quoted in the literature for other carabids, they are probably higher than the actual natural consumption rates.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0031-4056			WOS:A1993MD65200004

At the investigation site of Olpenitz, salinities varied between 11 and 15 parts per thousand, and water temperatures between 5 and 18-degrees-C during the period of in-situ experiments in 1981 and 1982. Common gobies sometimes attained a density of more than 100 individuals per square metre, nine-spined sticklebacks as much as 18 individuals per square meter. Their food changed depending on the supply of plankton or benthos. Regarding numbers, their food consisted mainly of harpacticoids, in springtimes of calanoids; with regard to weight, amphipods, polychaetes or chironomid larvae often prevailed. The total food ingestion, measured by means of its relation to fish weights (fullness index), was highest in spring and summer: 2.3% in P. microps and 2.6% in P. pungitius. Low fullness indices of 0.8% in P. microps and 0.3% in P. pungitius were found during times of low water temperatures. 24-h field investigations revealed that the adult P. microps presented of clear diurnal rhythms with highest fullness indices after dawn and a further maximum at dusk. Only young gobies ingested some benthos at night. P. pungitius displayed similar rhythms in which maximum fullness indices varied during the day. This species seems to forage every four hours. At dusk, both species preferred benthos to plankton. The results are discussed with respect to the implications of diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in prey choice by small-sized fish populations.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0174-3597			WOS:A1991HG61700002

These types of studies are, however, lacking for many protected species. Here, we conducted a novel study on the physiology of juvenile white sharks Carcharodon carcharias (139-325 cm fork length), a globally protected and ecologically important predator, in response to a standard fishery interaction using shark-management-alert-in-real-time (SMART) drumlines as part of a bather protection program. Specifically, we assessed the influence of short-term capture duration (average: similar to 30 min; range: 10-75 min) and other biological (size) and environmental (temperature) variables on blood plasma amino acids and fatty acids, which play essential roles as energy substrates as well as in maintaining physiological functions. None of the assessed amino acids or fatty acids were affected by capture duration, but some were influenced by shark size and water temperature. Our results support the notion that white shark physiology is robust to capture at short capture durations, which has important implications for the fate of released individuals.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1863-5407	1613-4796		WOS:000521740900008

Understanding effects of environmental stressors on wildlife is important to predict individual and population-level responses to stressors associated with climate change. Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, are a regionally threatened fish species that experience high predation rates during larval stages. To investigate effects of a high temperature stressor, we exposed lake sturgeon eggs from four families to 10 degrees C (low-stress) or 18 degrees C (high-stress) rearing temperatures. At egg, free embryo and larval stages, we quantified stress levels for individuals from each treatment using whole-body cortisol analysis at baseline and after an acute stressor. At the larval stage, we video-recorded behaviour trials to quantify swimming activity, and we conducted predation trials to quantify survival outcomes for individuals from high-stress and low-stress temperature treatments. Free embryos reared at 18 degrees C had a significantly smaller cortisol response after exposure to an acute stressor, indicating that chronic high temperature stress may reduce stress reactivity in lake sturgeon. In addition, larvae reared at 18 degrees C had significantly higher activity levels during behaviour trials and significantly higher survival rates when exposed to crayfish predation, indicating that behavioural alterations induced by early life stress may be adaptive in high-stress contexts such as predation. These findings illustrate the need to experimentally evaluate fitness effects of stressors within ecologically relevant contexts in order to predict population- and community-level outcomes of climate change.

Resident marine flounders (Platichthys flesus) and expansive freshwater roach (Rutilus rutilus) are dominant consumers in the Baltic Sea sublittoral where they occur in partial sympatry. By comparing patterns of resource use by flounders and roach along a declining resource gradient of blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) our aim was to explore predator functional responses and the degree of trophic overlap. Understanding the nature of density-dependent prey acquisition has important implications for predicting population dynamics of both predators and their shared prey. Results showed a highly specialized diet for both species, high reliance on blue mussels throughout the range, similar prey size preference and high trophic overlap. Highest overlap occurred where blue mussels were abundant but overlap was also high where they were scarce. Our results highlight the importance of a single food item - the blue mussel - for both species, likely promoting high population size and range expansion of roach. Findings also suggest that range expansion of roach may have a top-down structuring force on mussels that differ in severity and location from that originating from resident flounders.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000432531400002	29785034

Small changes in temperature can change the flow of carbon and the community structure of planktonic ecosystems, and climatological models predict a rise in temperature of 2 to 5 degrees C toward the end of the century in the NW Mediterranean. Laboratory culture experiments have shown that warming can increase the transfer of carbon between bacteria and protists and alter the community composition of microbial top predators (i.e. ciliates and dinoflagellates) by increasing the abundance of bacterivores and producing the extinction of herbivores. Here, we tested whether a small rise in temperature would produce these effects in the coastal Mediterranean. Between March 2003 and February 2004, we established 12 microcosm experiments with water from the Bay of Blanes. The samples were incubated for 48 h at ambient and warmer temperatures (similar to 2.7 degrees C higher than in situ values), and the net and gross growth rates of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were measured using unfiltered and 0.8 mu m filtered treatments. Warming increased the rates of bacterial gross production and bacterial losses to grazing with a clear seasonality; the largest increments in the rates were observed during the cooler months of the year. Warming did not change the net growth rates of dinoflagellates. It decreased the net production of HNF and the net growth rates of ciliates but did not promote the extinction of herbivorous protists. Temperature changed the microbial food web function in NW Mediterranean waters, with small alterations in the community composition of microbial top predators.									19	2	0	0	16	0	21			0948-3055	1616-1564		WOS:000310006400002

Strobilation. indicated by the presence of 1 mm ephyrae, occurred from the end Of January to the middle of March. Maximum abundances of up to 8.71 m-3 occurred soon after ephyrae release, after which numbers declined steadily until the end of June, when the population was absent from Southampton Water. The residence time of 3-4 months is somewhat less than that reported in many other areas, including Kiel Bight and Gullmarfjord. The carbon biomass of A.aurita accounted for 92-97% of the predominant gelatinous biomass (A. aurita, Pleurobrachia pileus and Phialidium hemisphericum) in the upper estuary, and this reached a maximum of 30.2 mg C m-3 in May 1990 and 27.6 mg C m-3 in June 1991. Coincident with increased water temperature and mesozooplankton abundance during May. growth rates increased from 0.02-0.30 mm day-1 to a peak of 4.8 mm day-1, with a maximum bell diameter of 120-140 mm reached in late May/early June. Size to maturity was variable, although the smallest medusa observed to be 'ripe', i.e. containing dividing eggs and planula larvae in the brood sacs on the oral arms. were 64-71 mm. Aurelia aurita is believed to be endemic to Southampton Water, but because of the double high water in the area, short flushing rates of between 4.5 and 20 days may be responsible for such short residence times of Aurelia medusae. The effects of strong NE winds were considered as factors governing the distribution of medusae in years of atypical temporal abundance.									48	5	0	0	37	0	53			0142-7873			WOS:A1994NZ20000009		
J	HUNTLEY, ME; LOPEZ, MDG								TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT PRODUCTION OF MARINE COPEPODS - A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS								AMERICAN NATURALIST				140	2			201	242		10.1086/285410				AUG 1992	1992	Estimating the production of marine copepods depends on measuring two key variables: biomass and growth rate. The major difficulty in estimating production of marine copepods and other zooplankton has been the inability to obtain precise, rapid measurements. In practice the variability in measurement of biomass greatly exceeds that in growth rate. It is shown here that individual growth rates of copepods can be accurately estimated from data on generation times and the weights of eggs and adults. Analysis of 181 separately published estimates of generation time for 33 species of copepods at environmental temperatures ranging from -1.7-degrees to 30.7-degrees-C shows that temperature alone explains more than 90% of the variance in growth rate. Temperature dependence of growth rate transcends species differences. Weight-specific growth rate appears to be independent of body size. We hypothesize that food may not be limiting to growth in nature; the impression that food is limiting may be due to sampling at the wrong scales. Another possible cause of the apparent maximum growth rates of copepods in nature is predation mortality, which could selectively remove slower-growing individuals from the population. The temperature-dependent model developed here predicts the phenomenon of decreasing body size with increasing environmental temperature, often observed for single species of copepods. A method is suggested for making more accurate estimates of secondary production by using modern instrumentation to make quasi-synoptic measurements of biomass and temperature and using the temperature-dependent model to estimate individual growth rates.									522	4	3	0	397	4	541			0003-0147			WOS:A1992JE84900002	19426057

Although the effects of bleaching-induced coral mortality on reef fishes have been well demonstrated, corals can remain bleached for several weeks prior to recovery or death and little is known about how bleaching affects resident fishes during this time period. This study compared growth rates of two species of juvenile butterflyfishes (Chaetodon aureofasciatus and Chaetodon lunulatus) that were restricted to feeding upon either bleached or healthy coral tissue of Acropora spathulata or Pocillopora damicornis. Coral condition (bleached vs. unbleached) had no significant effects on changes in total length or weight over a 23-day period. Likewise, in a habitat choice experiment, juvenile butterflyfishes did not discriminate between healthy and bleached corals, but actively avoided using recently dead colonies. These results indicate that juvenile coral-feeding fishes are relatively robust to short term effects of bleaching events, provided that the corals do recover.

The growth rate of trout in Corsica was analysed on samples from of six coastal rivers: the Tavignano, the Fium Orbo and the Golo on the west coast, the Prunelli, the Taravo and the Rizzanese on the east coast. Mesological data - conductivity, temperature, calcium content and altitude and biological data - biomass and linear growth rate of the trout, and density of benthic invertebrates - were collected at each of the sampling station.Analysis of variance of the size of three year old trout revealed three groups of rivers. The first includes the Tavignano, the Rizzanese and the Taravo, where the highest linear growth rates were recorded; the second consists of the Golo and the Prunelli, and the third, of the Fium Orbo. Principal component analysis gave two main axes on the basis of temperature and benthic invertebrate density for the first, and trout biomass for the second. Linear regression showed that benthic invertebrate density accounted for 75% of size variance of three year old trout. Evidence of the limiting role of the trophic factor is provided.									6	3	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158			WOS:A1996VR83900007

However, recent modeling studies have shown that the population's growth rate increased gradually during the 1980s, but began declining in the early 1990s, when female mortality rates increased substantially. Demographic projections predict that, assuming birth and mortality rates remain comparable to those observed in the early 1990s, the population will become extinct in less than 200 years. Further extrapolations suggest that reducing mortality rates by a few female deaths per year through conservation efforts would be sufficient to support a slow recovery of the population. However, the effects of climate variability and change on calving rates may make the North Atlantic right whale even more vulnerable than previous projections have suggested. Failure to incorporate the effects of climate in demographic projections may lead us to underestimate the conservation efforts required to ensure recovery of this whale population.									59	0	0	0	50	0	63			1540-9295	1540-9309		WOS:000221791800019

In addition to bacteria and algae, heterotrophic protists and small metazoans can also occur in high abundances in biofilms. By grazing on planktonic prey, biofilm-dwelling grazers can act as a trophic link between planktonic and benthic food webs, parallel to filter-feeding benthic macroinvertebrates. Here we introduce a flow cell method for the quantification of grazing rates of semi-natural biofilms on suspended bacteria, parallel to microscopic biofilm community analysis. This technique was used to measure the temperature response of the grazing rates of complex biofilm communities (established in a bypass system to the River Rhine, Germany) on planktonic bacteria. Results showed that 14 d old biofilms (dominated by ciliates) clear planktonic bacteria at rates between 29 (in winter) and 99 1 m(-2) biofilm d(-1) (in summer) at ambient temperature, These rates increased with test temperature, even at temperatures (> 30 degrees C) at which the grazing rates of filter-feeding macrofauna in moderate climates are negatively influenced. The acclimation temperatures under which the biofilm developed can have a significant effect on community clearance rates, largely due to a temperature effect on the abundance and structure of the grazer community, whereas no indication of an acclimation effect on individual grazing rates could be found. In the function of bentho-pelagic couplers, biofilm-dwelling consumer communities can react to temperature changes substantially faster than macrofaunal filter feeders.									52	2	0	0	47	0	53			0948-3055	1616-1564		WOS:000266124700006

Information on population structure of invaders and their new niche is needed in order to understand their biological impact. Over one year, we assessed temporal changes in relative abundance, size-class and sex ratio, as well as breeding season of H. takanoi in the Kiel Fjord (Western Baltic Sea). In addition, prey size preference and consumption rates on mussels (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758) were experimentally assessed in spring, summer and autumn. A total of 596 individuals were collected with highest and lowest abundances in June and February, respectively. Females were dominant over males (sex ratio 1.4:1), but males grew to larger sizes. H. takanoi reproduced between June and August with ovigerous females representing 30% of the entire female abundance registered over the entire year. Males were able to open larger mussels (due to larger claws) and consumed twice as many mussels when compared to females of similar size. Consumption rates for males were 6 and 2 times higher in summer (seawater temperature of 19 degrees C) compared to spring (8 degrees C) and autumn (13 degrees C), respectively. Females consumed 3 times more mussels in autumn than in spring. H. takanoi is an active predator, capable of reproduction in stressful brackish water conditions. Due to large abundances and high feeding pressure, this recently introduced species could play a key role in structuring post-settlement population dynamics of the dominant habitat builder M. edulis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1798-6540	1818-5487		WOS:000548002800006

Keeley, Ernest/AAD-7789-2019	Keeley, Ernest/0000-0003-2633-1361			Prey size, prey abundance, and temperature as correlates of growth in stream populations of cutthroat trout								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				97	5	SI		599	614		10.1007/s10641-014-0219-x				MAY 2014	2014	Growth and maximum size of stream fishes can be highly variable across populations. For salmonid fishes in streams, individuals from populations confined to headwater streams often exhibit small size at maturity in comparison to populations with access to main-stem rivers. Differences in prey size, prey availability, and metabolic constraints based on temperature may explain patterns of maximum size and growth. In this study, cutthroat trout from headwater stream populations that were isolated above a waterfall were compared to individuals from populations in similar sized streams without a movement barrier and from large main-stem rivers. Cutthroat trout from smaller streams with or without a movement barrier were significantly smaller at a given age than fish from main-stem rivers, where individuals were able to achieve a much larger maximum size. Comparisons of invertebrate drift abundance and size in the three types of streams revealed that drift size did not differ between stream categories, but was highest per volume of water in large main-stem rivers. Across all stream types, prey abundance declined from summer to fall. Temperature declined over the course of the season in a similar manner across all stream types, but remained relatively high later in the season in main-stem river habitats. Prey availability and temperature conditions in main-stem rivers may provide more optimal growing conditions for fish as individuals increase in size and become constrained by prey availability and temperature conditions in small streams. Maintaining connectivity between small spawning and rearing tributary streams and main-stem river habitats may be critical in maintaining large-bodied populations of stream salmonids.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000334126100014

In total four flatfish species were caught, three common Bothidae species: the eyed flounder Bothus ocellatus, the mottled or maculated flounder B. maculiferus and the peacock flounder B. lunatus, and in small numbers- the channel flounder Syacium micrurwn. B. ocellatus and S. micrurwn only occurred in sandy moats on the shallow reef terrace and fore reef and between coral patches on the terrace and fore reef slope. The other species could also be found on coral patches. The depth distribution of the various species overlapped: all species were caught over a depth range from a few meters up to 20 m. All Bothus species were carnivores, preying on a variety of mobile benthic animals such as fishes and crustaceans. Reproduction seemed to occur year round in all three Bothus species. Growth between the species varied considerably with a maximum age found in B. maculiferus and B. lunatus of a little over 1 year, and in B. ocellatus of about 2 years. Growth was lowest in B. ocellatus and highest in B. lunatus: after one year B. ocellatus was about 10 cm in size, B. maculiferus 25 cm and B. lunatus about 35 cm. After correction for differences in water temperature, the Bothus species showed a similar variability and range in growth rate as some temperate and subtropical flatfish species. These observations do not fit the hypothesis postulated by Pauly (1994) of an increasing importance of food-limitation in juvenile flatfish with decreasing latitude, despite the low densities and biomass of benthic in- and epifauna in the soft sediments in mangroves, seagrass beds and the reefs of Curacao.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1385-1101	1873-1414		WOS:000451103400014

In aquatic environments, salinity adds costs for ion transportation to the energetic budgets of osmoregulating animals, such as teleost fishes. These additional costs may limit the available energy for important ecological traits of fishes, including maximal and optimal swimming performance, which are required for successful foraging and migration in the wild. Here, we hypothesize that swimming performance, and its related costs, will be optimized at near-isoosmotic salinity, and decline under more saline conditions. Using the euryhaline shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata) as a model for coastal fishes, we determined critical swimming speeds and oxygen consumption rates during swimming at salinities of 12 g kg(-1) (near-isoosmotic, brackish, S12) and 31 g kg(-1) (hyperosmotic, marine, S31). Most tested metrics were unaffected by salinity, including aerobic scope, active metabolic rate and optimal swimming speed. Likewise, critical swimming speed (in body lengths per second, BL s(-1)) was not significantly different between fishes acclimated to S12 (4.8 +/- 0.6 BL s(-1)) or S31 (5.1 +/- 0.5 BL s(-1), means +/- SD, n = 5) suggesting that the fish could swim and hunt for prey equally well regardless of salinity. However, S31 conditions did cause comparatively higher oxygen consumption rates at swimming speeds from 0.5 to 1.5 BL s(-1), and a 20% increase in the extrapolated standard metabolic rate (i.e. cost of maintaining bodily functions). Our results confirm that there is an added energetic cost of salinity, but highlight that the cost of osmoregulation appears minimal relative to the energetic demands of swimming, and consequently has no effect on the maximal swimming performance of adult shiner perch. Given the strong salinity gradients naturally encountered in many coastal ecosystems, these data provide an explanation for the capacity of a coastal roaming species to move in an out of coastal habitat zones without significantly compromising their ability to hunt prey, avoid predation and migrate. As climate change locally affects environmental salinity, our results offer valuable insight towards the effects of environmental perturbations on fishes in coastal marine and estuarine habitats.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000432770300004

Rarely has the importance of these factors been tested concurrently in the field. Our study spanned three spatial scales in estuarine waters of Washington state (Region: north vs. south; Within-region: fresher vs. saline; Within-site: mid- vs. low-tidal elevation). Predator access and sediment conditions were manipulated in a crossed experimental design, with juvenile (3-mm and 6-mm) Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinanan) outplanted in open- or closed-top mesh tubes. We found differences between treatments that appeared only at sites with cancrid crabs, suggesting that predators, rather than emigration, likely reduced numbers of clams in open tubes. We had hypothesized that clams at lower tidal elevations, which experience longer immersion times, would show improved growth but reduced survivorship because of greater exposure to marine predators. However, these patterns were evident at only one of three sites (lower-elevation treatments were lost at the fourth). The larger size class of clams was more tolerant of abiotic stressors at all sites, but the magnitude of difference in survival between size classes was sometimes dependent on other treatments. The maximum predator effect on survival was 74% (north, high salinity, low-intertidal site), whereas the maximum abiotic effect appeared as 62% lower survival and 59% slower growth for 3-mm clams at another site (north, fresher). In laboratory trials, high water temperatures (28-32 degrees C) and low salinity (5-15) acted synergistically to cause juvenile clam (6-12 mm) mortality, whereas clams tolerated each of these stressors alone. Context-dependence in the relative importance of predation and abiotic stressors was apparent in our results, but contrary to expectations, abiotic stressors did not characterize southern or fresher sites. Instead, extreme high temperatures occurred at the site with the wide tidal flat rather than in the south, and the within-region salinity differences appeared not to exceed tolerances of juvenile clams.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0272-7714	1096-0015		WOS:000462100000020

Reproduction and molting incur high energetic demands that are sustained at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) by both inshore (phytoplankton blooms; "island mass effect"; autochthonous) and offshore (allochthonous) productivity. As the relative contributions of these sustenance pathways are, in turn, affected by oceanographic conditions around the PEIs, we address the consequences of climatically driven changes in the physical environment on this island ecosystem. We show that there has been a measurable long-term shift in the carbon isotope signatures of the benthos inhabiting the shallow shelf region of the PEIs, most likely reflecting a long-term decline in enhanced phytoplankton productivity at the islands in response to a climate-driven shift in the position of the sub-Antarctic Front. Our results indicate that regional climate change has affected the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous productivity at the PEIs. Over the last three decades, inshore-feeding top predators at the islands have shown a marked decrease in their population sizes. Conversely, population sizes of off-shore-feeding predators that forage over great distances from the islands have remained stable or increased, with one exception. Population decline of predators that rely heavily on organisms inhabiting the inshore region strongly suggest changes in prey availability, which are likely driven by factors such as fisheries impacts on some prey populations and shifts in competitive interactions among predators. In addition to these local factors, our analysis indicates that changes in prey availability may also result indirectly through regional climate change effects on the islands' marine ecosystem. Most importantly, our results indicate that a fundamental shift in the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous trophic pathways within this island ecosystem may be detected throughout the food web, demonstrating that the most powerful effects of climate change on marine systems may be indirect.									33	0	0	0	23	2	34			2045-7758			WOS:000324046400018	24101989

In order to quantify habitat quality, several authors have combined bioenergetic and foraging models to generate spatially explicit estimates of fish growth rate potential (GRP). However, the capacity of GRP to reflect the spatial distributions of fishes over large areas has not been fully evaluated. We generated landscape scale estimates of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) GRP throughout Lake Michigan for 1994-1996, and used these estimates to test the hypotheses that GRP is a good predictor of spatial patterns of steelhead catch rates. We used surface temperatures (measured with AVHRR satellite imagery) and acoustically measured steelhead prey densities (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus) as inputs for the GRP model. Our analyses demonstrate that potential steelhead growth rates in Lake Michigan are highly variable in both space and time. Steelhead GRP tended to increase with latitude, and mean GRP was much higher during September 1995, compared to 1994 and 1996. In addition, our study suggests that landscape scale measures of GRP are not good predictors of steelhead catch rates throughout Lake Michigan, but may provide an index of interannual variation in system-wide habitat quality.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0380-1330			WOS:000226952000008

The invasion ecology and, in particular, the population dynamics of the species in this country are, however, poorly understood. In this study the relative abundance and population dynamics of G. affinis were quantified in 5 interconnected irrigation impoundments within the Sundays River Valley, Eastern Cape. Four fish surveys were conducted from early summer (February 2012) to early winter (June 2012). Repeated-measures ANOVA analyses on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of G. affinis between sampling events and dams revealed significant differences in population dynamics among dams, although an overall trend of rapid increase followed by plateau in summer, with a rapid decline in winter was seen in most dams. A general linear model assessing the role of biotic and abiotic factors on G. affinis CPUE found that water temperature and the presence of the native fish Glossogobius callidus had significant effects on the CPUE of G. affinis. While winter drops in temperature are likely to have caused mortality in G. affinis populations, and may act as the primary regulator of G. affinis establishment success in South African impoundments, the negative effect of G. callidus densities on G. affinis suggests competitive or predator-prey interactions with the native species.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0378-4738	1816-7950		WOS:000323607300006

Daphnia magna of 1.25 mm average length served as prey. The following were measured: amount of prey ingested, larval weight gain, duration of fourth instar, body weight of the adults, and egg number per female. At a given temperature, the body weight, egg-number and developmental rate increased with food consumption. At a given food consumption, higher temperatures caused a decrease in body weight and egg number, and an increase in developmental rate. Gross production efficiencies for fourth-instar larvae were highest at temperatures around 17-degrees-C. The results clearly indicate that from an energetic point of view higher temperatures are disadvantageous. In C. crystal-linus vertical migration is evidently a way of lowering the temperature to which the animals are exposed and hence optimizing food conversion into biomass and offspring production, especially if prey densities are below the saturation level.									32	0	0	0	33	0	35			0029-8549			WOS:A1991GU19000003	28312615

After incubation of the samples at 20-degrees-C for three weeks, a flagellate was detected as the most dominant mycophagous protozoan. Conidia of several fungi, with minimum diameters between 2 and 16-mu-m, supported growth of this flagellate, irrespective of pigmentation. Bacteria however could not be used for growth, although bacteria and also latex beads of the same size were ingested. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of an obligate mycophagous soil-borne flagellate. The flagellate was able to grow at the expense of the conidia of D. coniospora in liquid culture, with a specific growth rate of about 0.1 h-1; the optimum temperature was 20-24-degrees-C. Approximately 10 D. coniospora conidia were required for one flagellate division. In sterilized soil, enriched with 10(8) D. coniospora conidia per g dry soil, the specific growth rate was 0.014 h-1, when the soil was at 50 or 65% of its water-holding capacity (WHC). In drier soil, i.e. 25% WHC, no growth took place. During growth of the flagellate in soil, the number of D. coniospora was reduced by about 20%, which was in the same order of magnitude as expected on the basis of the requirement of 10 D. coniospora conidia for one flagellate division. Since many conidia remained in the soil after growth of the flagellate, we concluded that although the flagellate is an interesting organism, it does not play a very important role in the survival of D. coniospora conidia in the soil.									16	0	0	0	16	0	17			0168-6496			WOS:A1992HB41100009

Ecosystem approach to fisheries: Exploring environmental and trophic effects on Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) reference point estimates								PLOS ONE				12	9					e018557	10.1371/journal.pone.0185575				SEP 28 2017	2017	We present a comprehensive analysis of estimation of fisheries Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) reference points using an ecosystem model built for Mille Lacs Lake, the second largest lake within Minnesota, USA. Data from single-species modelling output, extensive annual sampling for species abundances, annual catch-survey, stomach-content analysis for predatory-prey interactions, and expert opinions were brought together within the framework of an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) ecosystem model. An increase in the lake water temperature was observed in the last few decades; therefore, we also incorporated a temperature forcing function in the EwE model to capture the influences of changing temperature on the species composition and food web. The EwE model was fitted to abundance and catch time-series for the period 1985 to 2006. Using the ecosystem model, we estimated reference points for most of the fished species in the lake at single-species as well as ecosystem levels with and without considering the influence of temperature change; therefore, our analysis investigated the trophic and temperature effects on the reference points. The paper concludes that reference points such as MSY are not stationary, but change when (1) environmental conditions alter species productivity and (2) fishing on predators alters the compensatory response of their prey. Thus, it is necessary for the management to re-estimate or re-evaluate the reference points when changes in environmental conditions and/or major shifts in species abundance or community structure are observed.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000411985200088		
J	VANDYKHUIZEN, G; MOLLET, HF								GROWTH, AGE ESTIMATION AND FEEDING OF CAPTIVE SEVENGILL SHARKS, NOTORYNCHUS-CEPEDIANUS, AT THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				43	1			297	318						1992	1992	Five methods, all based on the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) model, were used with captive sevengills to characterize growth and to estimate both age and age at sexual maturity. Fabens' method (MI) gave a high k = 0.25 +/- 0.04 year-1 and a low L(infinity) = 202 +/- 13 cm and W(infinity) = 41 +/- 11 kg. Determination of the third VBGF parameter, L0 or W0, requires age to be known.Reported estimates of size at birth were used to estimate ages of individual sharks. For the 'individual VBGF fit' method (M2), the age axis was fixed by using size at birth. For the 'derivative' method (M3), a growth rate was calculated from observed size when the sharks were received and size at birth. The results of either method confirmed that two sharks were first-year class and three sharks were second-year class when they were received. Both M2 and M3 required the use of a combination of total length (TL) and weight data via the 'TL-scaled cube root weight' method (M4) to obtain adequate statistics for individual sharks.The 'exponential regression' method (M5) was used to predict the sizes and ages of larger and older sharks. Age at sexual maturity for males was estimated by using L(infinity) = 225-250 cm and k = 0- 174 to 0 - 132 year-1, which gave 4 - 3 to 5 years, in good agreement with the age estimated from clasper-length measurements from a single male. Age at sexual maturity for females was estimated by using L(infinity) = 275-300 cm and k = 0.107 to 0-090 year-1, which gave 11-21 years.Feeding habits have been monitored for captive sevengill sharks since 1985. Pups consumed up to 2% of their body weight (BW) per day, juveniles about 0.6% BW day-1, and adults about 0.2% BW day-1. Food consumption and, more importantly, total efficiency changed with age. The observed large food consumption and the observed high total efficiency of pups could be substantiated on the basis of a theoretical calculation of food intake based on von Bertalanffy growth. Adult sevengills showed a 'feast or famine' feeding pattern that followed a cycle of 5-7 days and that may have been influenced by water temperature and previous meal size.We conclude that growth rates in captivity and in the field are similar, based on the available growth data and feeding behaviour of sevengills in captivity and in the field.									34	0	0	0	33	0	37			0067-1940			WOS:A1992HX19300024

Yet only little is known about the effects of fresh SGD on the fitness of higher trophic levels such as teleost fish. Otolith analysis revealed that somatic growth rates were significantly higher and settlement to reef habitat took place significantly earlier in juvenile gray demoiselle Chrysiptera glauca exposed to fresh SGD as compared to strictly marine conditions. Contrary to expectations, feeding conditions were comparable in both habitats. We propose that physiologically beneficial environmental conditions brought about by the submarine influx of cold acidic freshwater enabled juvenile fish to exhibit elevated growth rates, thereby increasing their survival potential. This effect would directly link changes in groundwater on land to variations in marine primary and secondary consumer biomass at the coast.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4				2296-7745		WOS:000490151300001

While many species will be exposed to pesticides and warming both in the parental and offspring generations, transgenerational effects of pesticides under warming are still poorly studied, particularly for behaviour. We therefore studied the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and warming both within and across generations on antipredator behaviour of larvae of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens, Within each generation pesticide exposure and warming reduced the escape diving time, making the larvae more susceptible to predation. Pesticide exposure of the parents did not affect offspring anti predator behaviour. Yet, parental exposure to warming determined how warming and the pesticide interacted in the offspring generation. When parents were reared at 24 degrees C, warming no longer reduced offspring diving times in the solvent control, suggesting an adaptive transgenerational effect to prepare the offspring to better deal with a higher predation risk under warming. Related to this, the CPF-induced reduction in diving time was stronger at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, except in the offspring whose parents had been exposed to 24 degrees C. This dependency of the widespread interaction between warming and pesticide exposure on an adaptive transgenerational effect of warming is an important finding at the interface of global change ecology and ecotoxicology.

J	Gilman, Sarah E.								Predicting Indirect Effects of Predator-Prey Interactions								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				57	1			148	158		10.1093/icb/icx031				JUL 2017	2017	Predicting the effects of climate change on species and communities remains a pre-eminent challenge for biologists. Critical among this is understanding the indirect effects of climate change, which arise when the direct, physiological effects of climate on one species change the outcome of its interaction with a second species, altering the success of the second species. A diverse array of approaches to predicting indirect effects exists from mechanistic models, which attempt to build-up from physiological changes to ecological consequences, to ecological models that focus solely on the ecological scale. Here I review studies of the indirect effects of temperature on two predator-prey systems in rocky intertidal habitats. Laboratory and field studies have shown that temperature can indirectly affect interactions through both physiological and behavioral changes in predator and prey, but no model yet captures the full range of these effects. The three main categories of changes are metabolic rate effects, stress effects, and behavioral avoidance. Mechanistic models best capture the first two of these three dynamics, while ecological models have focused mainly on the last two. The challenge remains to correctly identify a species' vulnerability to climate change, which differs from its physiological sensitivity. The best approach may be to use detailed physiological-scale studies of indirect effect in a few systems to ground truth simpler models that can be applied more broadly. Model development and testing is also hampered by the small number of field studies of indirect effects in natural systems, particularly studies that examine natural temporal or spatial variation in climate.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000406594300013	28655194

To understand how such differences in coral cover influence obligate corallivores, we examined the densities and foraging behavior of Melon butterflyfish Chaetodon trifasciatus across three reefs in the Lakshadweep archipelago. These reefs suffered differential bleaching mortality after the 2010 El Nino Southern Oscillation, resulting in wide variation in coral cover and community composition. Despite these differences, C.trifasciatus were able to persist at similar densities across reefs. However, our analysis of high-resolution video recordings of multiple focal fish revealed that time budgets, bite rates, and diet selectivity differed significantly. Fish in resource-poor reefs spent more time moving between coral patches and less time foraging than ones in relatively resource-rich reefs. We also found that fish in resource-poor reefs had higher bite rates and were less selective in their foraging. Our results provide novel insights into how obligate corallivores cope with even large differences in resource availability. At a time when we are rapidly losing corals to repeated climate-induced bleaching events, this flexibility may represent a critical mechanism that enables persistence of obligate corallivores in resource-poor reefs, even if it does not guarantee longer-term survival.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0179-1613	1439-0310		WOS:000430003100004

We tested the hypothesis that interspecific difference in the capacity for thermal acclimation modulates predator-prey interactions. Acclimation of locomotor performance in a predator (Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata) was qualitatively different to that of its prey (eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki). Warm (25 degrees C) acclimated bass made more attacks than cold (15 degrees C) acclimated fish regardless of acute test temperatures (10-30 degrees C), and greater frequency of attacks was associated with increased prey capture success. However, the number of attacks declined at the highest test temperature (30 degrees C). Interestingly, escape speeds of mosquitofish during predation trials were greater than burst speeds measured in a swimming arena, whereas attack speeds of bass were lower than burst speeds. As a result, escape speeds of mosquitofish were greater at warm temperatures (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) than attack speeds of bass. The decline in the number of attacks and the increase in escape speed of prey means that predation pressure decreases at high temperatures. We show that differential thermal responses affect species interactions even at temperatures that are within thermal tolerance ranges. This thermal sensitivity of predator-prey interactions can be a mechanism by which global warming affects ecological communities.									83	2	0	0	78	0	84			0962-8452			WOS:000308239500022	22859598

Possible population dynamic mechanisms that lead to such dominance are investigated by considering how a charmingly simple published multispecies model of the North Sea would react if the system operated at a lower temperature. The existing model equations were modified to describe temperature effects on growth, fecundity and recruitment and the model was rerun based on typical temperatures for the North Sea and a colder system. The results suggest that total fish biomass in the colder system increases but the community is more vulnerable to a given rate of fishing mortality. In the colder system, within species density dependence is reduced but relative predation rates are higher. Consequently, intermediate-sized species are vulnerable to relatively high levels of predation throughout their life history and tend to be excluded, leading to a system dominated by small and large species. The model helps to explain how temperature may govern coexistence and competitive exclusion in fish communities and accounts for the observed dominance of small and large species in Boreal/Arctic ecosystems.

This characteristic is typically regarded as enabling young to be born when conditions are optimal. The birth of T. fasciata occurs in April/May, when water temperatures are still high and conducive to rapid growth. Furthermore, because gut fullness in this and subsequent months was similar to other times of the year, the prey of neonates, i.e. mysids, carids, pinnotherids, amphipods and isopods, were presumably abundant in that period. Ovulation occurs in April/May and embryos grow rapidly between December and birth in April/May. Females grew to greater lengths than males, i.e. 1460 v. 890 mm, and matured (L-50) at larger lengths, i.e. 892 v. 678 mm respectively. As body size increased, teleosts, pilumnid and portunid crabs and molluscs became important dietary components. Overall, the diet consisted predominantly of crustaceans, fish, polychaetes and molluscs, with volumetric contributions of 73.4, 17.2, 5.3 and 2.8% respectively. Dietary composition underwent a cyclical seasonal change and differed among locations, indicating some degree of opportunistic feeding. Interspecific comparisons indicate that benthic food resources are partitioned among and within the main batoid species in south-western Australian waters.									38	0	0	0	36	0	38			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000243839400012

Bioenergetics models were used to evaluate the growth rate potential of a cool-water fish, the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and a warm-water fish, the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), across thermal fronts of different temperatures and prey concentrations. The distributions of growth rate potentials across these fronts depended on fish physiology, the temperatures encompassed by the front, and prey distributions across the front. When food was distributed uniformly across the front, the growth rates of both species were highest at their optimal temperatures, if sufficient prey was available. Lower temperatures were better for growth if prey availability was low. Increased food availability at the front enhanced fish growth rate potential at the front. Actual growth rates depended on whether the fish behaviorally selected habitats by temperature, food, or growth rate potential. Results illustrate that prey patchiness and the nonlinearities inherent in the relationship of fish growth to temperature and prey availability must be considered in order to evaluate how a population of fish might respond to a front and how the front might affect fish growth and production.									63	0	0	0	48	1	68			0160-8347			WOS:A1993LJ17500012

To understand the mechanisms regulating fish recruitment intensity in these estuaries and evaluate the consequences of freshwater shortages on juvenile habitat quality, a growth study was conducted in the Saloum hypersaline estuary (Senegal). The Mugilidae fish family, highly representative of estuarine environments, was targeted and several species sampled (Chelon dumerili, Mugil bananensis and M. cf. curema sp. M). Juveniles were sampled monthly all the year round in three areas of the estuary exhibiting strongly contrasted habitat conditions. Otolith sections were used to estimate the ages, reconstruct growth trajectories, estimate the duration of the oceanic larval phase, and evaluate juvenile growth variability along the salinity gradient. Analyses revealed that the temporal recruitment variability of C. dumerili, with 2 annual cohorts, was not mainly induced by growth-selection mechanisms, but probably more by predation pressures. Juveniles exhibited significantly faster growth rates in the lower salinity suggesting that benthic food availability was a strong factor controlling habitat quality of early juveniles. Salinity had also a clear impact when reducing the growth in hypersaline conditions and/or selecting slower growing individuals. Moderate freshwater inputs positively affected the nursery function of the estuary for mugilids by enhancing the productivity of the first trophic levels. In a long term, the global change could have an impact of the mugilid fishery and its management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Both Arctic charr and brown trout predominantly used the littoral zone during winter time. Despite very cold winter conditions (water temperature < 1A degrees C) and poor light conditions, both fish species fed continuously during the ice-covered period, although at a much lower rate than during the summer season. No somatic growth could be detected during the ice-covered winter period and the condition factor of both species significantly declined, suggesting that the winter feeding rates were similar to or below the maintenance requirements. Also, the species richness and diversity of ingested prey largely decreased from summer to winter for both fish species. The winter diet of Arctic charr < 20 cm was dominated by benthic insect larvae, chironomids in particular, and Gammarus lacustris, but zooplankton was also important in December. G. lacustris was the dominant prey of charr > 20 cm. The winter diet of brown trout < 20 cm was dominated by insect larvae, whereas large-sized trout mainly was piscivorous, feeding on juvenile Arctic charr. Piscivorous feeding behaviour of trout was in contrast rarely seen during the summer months when their encounter with potential fish prey was rare as the small-sized charr mainly inhabited the profundal. The study demonstrated large differences in the ecology and interactions of Arctic charr and brown trout between the winter and summer seasons.					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008MAY 24-28, 2008	Univ Jyvaskyla; Univ Joensuu; Univ HelsinkiUniv Jyvaskyla; Univ Joensuu; Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLANDKilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	47	0	0	0	47	0	48			1386-2588	1573-5125		WOS:000269837500017

Several outbreaks have occurred with losses estimated at millions of dollars. Insects are affected by climate factors, and climate change may affect geographical range, growth rate, abundance, survival, mortality, number of generations per year and other characteristics. These effects are difficult to project due to the complex interactions among insects, hosts and predators. The aim of the current research is to project the impact of climate change on future suitability for the expansion and final range of FAW as well as highlight the risk of damage due to the pest under current and future conditions. The modelling was carried out using two general circulation models (GCMs), CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H, for 2050 and 2100 under the A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), using the known distribution of the species and the CliMond meteorological database. The possible number of generations was estimated to exceed five in the south-eastern USA by 2100. A unique modelling approach linking environmental suitability and number of generations was developed to project the risks of FAW damage. The results show changes in suitability and risk across America, with an increase in the northern hemisphere and decreases or extinction in the southern hemisphere, except for southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and northern Argentina, which indicate high future levels of risk. The current study highlights the possible extinction of a tropical pest in areas near the Equator. The two GCMs both projected increases in the low-risk category of 40% by 2050 and 23% by 2100, with the medium- and high-risk categories decreasing by >50% by 2050 and >39% by 2100, compared with the current risk. In general, agricultural pest management may become more challenging under future climate change and variation, and thus, understanding and quantifying the possible impacts of FAW under future climate conditions is essential for the future economic production of crops.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0021-8596	1469-5146		WOS:000439880600003		
J	Legrand, Erwann; Martin, Sophie; Leroux, Cedric; Riera, Pascal								Effect of temperature on an alga-grazer trophic transfer: A dual stable isotope (C-13, N-15) labeling experiment								MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE				39	2					e12495	10.1111/maec.12495				APR 2018	2018	In this study, we examined the impact of temperature on the carbon and nitrogen trophic transfers from a macroalga to a macro-grazer by the use of dual C-13- and N-15-labeling. Using an experimental approach in mesocosms, individuals of the urchin Psammechinus miliaris were maintained for 1month at 17 degrees C (mean summer temperature in the Bay of Brest) and at 20 degrees C (maximum summer temperature) and fed with C-13- and N-15-labeled Solieria chordalis. The results showed that the urchins' C-13 uptake was 0.30 mu g(13)Cg dry weight (DW)(-1) at 17 degrees C and 0.14 mu g(13)Cg DW-1 at 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment. The lower uptake at the higher temperature may be attributed to a decrease in metabolic activity at 20 degrees C, involving lower feeding and/or respiration rates. Conversely, no significant effect of temperature was detected on N-15 uptake. At the end of the experiment, the urchins' N-15 uptake was 0.04 mu g(15)Ng DW-1 at 17 degrees C and 0.03 mu g(15)Ng DW-1 at 20 degrees C. This suggests that temperature may affect carbon and nitrogen trophic fluxes differently. The use of dual isotope labeling offers interesting prospects and needs to be further extended in order to better understand trophic interactions in marine communities and the consequences of current environmental changes, such as global warming.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0173-9565	1439-0485		WOS:000436113400005

These processes are often nonlinear and occur at rates strongly influenced by the physical habitat. The spatial patchiness of both fish density and habitat has hampered our ability to separate the effects of density and habitat on production. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fish growth rate potential. Growth rate potential integrates physiologically-based models of fish growth rate with high-resolution spatial data on prey sizes, prey density, and the physical environment. By combining the strengths of bioenergetics models to simulate fish growth and of bioacoustics to measure fish density and size in a spatially-explicit framework, the approach overcomes some of the difficulties inherent in a spatially-patchy environment. The result is a two-dimensional, nonlinear model of fish growth and system production. Predator behavior and foraging algorithms provide additional model refinement. An example from Chesapeake Bay striped bass demonstrates that the spatial distributions and statistics of fish growth rate differ from those of the underlying physical and biological properties of the system. The integration of the two types of technologies improves predictions of how changes in spatial patterning and absolute scaling of the environment might affect individual and population growth rates and system production.									125	0	0	0	112	2	129			0363-2415			WOS:A1992HL15900006		
J	Beamish, RJ; Mahnken, C								A critical size and period hypothesis to explain natural regulation of salmon abundance and the linkage to climate and climate change								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				49	1-4	SI		423	437		10.1016/S0079-6611(01)00034-9				2001	2001	We hypothesise that salmon year class strength is determined in two stages during the first year in the ocean. There is an early natural mortality that is mostly related to predation, which is followed by a physiologically-based mortality. Juvenile salmon that fail to reach a critical size by the end of their first marine summer do not survive the following winter. In this study we describe our initial tests of this critical size and critical period hypothesis using data from ocean surveys of juvenile salmon and from experimental feeding studies on coho. Conservative swept volume abundance estimates for juvenile coho, and possibly chinook, indicate that there is high mortality in fall and winter during their first year in the sea. Studies of otolith weight show that the length and otolith-weight relationship for young coho changes in the early fall of their first ocean year. Studies of growth and associated hormone levels in feeding studies show that slow growing juvenile coho are stunted and deficient in an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Juvenile coho sampled in September had low IGF-I values, indicative of poor growth. The results of these studies provide evidence for the general hypothesis that growth-related mortality occurs late in the first marine year and may be important in determining the strength of the year class (brood year). The link between total mortality and climate could be operating via the availability of nutrients regulating the food supply and hence competition for food (i.e. bottom-up regulation).

J	Knudson, Timothy W.; Lovvorn, James R.; Lawonn, M. James; Corcoran, Robin M.; Roby, Daniel D.; Piatt, John F.; Pyle, William H.								Can oceanic prey effects on growth and time to fledging mediate terrestrial predator limitation of an at-risk seabird?								ECOSPHERE				11	10					e03229	10.1002/ecs2.3229				OCT 2020	2020	Most seabird species nest colonially on cliffs or islands with limited terrestrial predation, so that oceanic effects on the quality or quantity of prey fed to chicks more often determine nest success. However, when predator access increases, impacts can be dramatic, especially when exposure to predators is extended due to slow growth from inadequate food. Kittlitz's Murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris), a rare seabird having experienced serious declines, nests solitarily on the ground in barren, often alpine areas where exposure to predators is generally low. Nestling growth rates are exceptionally high and nestling periods very short relative to other Alcidae. This strategy reduces duration of exposure to predators, but demands adequate deliveries of high-energy prey. In an area where foxes can access nests, we investigated whether varying energy content of prey fed to chicks could alter growth rates and resulting duration of predator exposure, and whether prolonged exposure appreciably reduced nest success. From 2009 to 2016, we monitored 139 nests; 49% were depredated (almost all by foxes) and 25% fledged. Prey fed to nestlings were 80% Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes personatus) and 19% capelin (Mallotus villosus), with capelin having 2.3x higher energy content per fish. In a year of slow chick growth, increased sand lance energy density of 31% (4.29-5.64 kJ/g, within published values), or increased proportion of capelin in the diet from 5.6% to 27.2%, would have allowed maximum chick growth. Maximum growth rates were attainable by delivering only 1.9 capelin/d versus 5.5 sand lance/d. Slow growth increased time to fledging by up to 5 d, decreasing survival by 7.7% (0.142-0.131). Breeding propensity of Kittlitz's Murrelet averages only 20%, so even small changes in nest success could affect populations. Although nest success was limited mainly by predation, oceanic effects on prey quantity and quality had overriding impacts in one year (2015 heat wave), and small but substantive effects in other years by mediating exposure to predation. Climate warming that decreases availability of high-energy forage fish, or increases expansion of predators into nesting habitats, may disproportionately affect this sensitive species and others with predator-accessible nests and demands for energy-rich prey.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2150-8925			WOS:000588068600013

J	Huryn, AD								River-floodplain linkage determines production dynamics of detritivorous and predacious mayflies (Ephemeroptera) in a sedge-meadow wetland								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				155	3			455	480						OCT 2002	2002	The macroinvertebrate communities of riparian sedge-meadows in Maine (U.S.A.) are unusual, compared to other types of freshwater wetlands, because they are dominated by mayflies during a 1-2 mo period of spring flooding, and because one mayfly species, Siphlonisca aerodromia, is a predator of the other mayflies. The objectives of this study were to determine temporal patterns of production for mayflies inhabiting a sedge meadow along Tomah Stream in sub-boreal Maine, and to identify key factors influencing their production in this wetland. During spring flooding, mayflies contributed 80-86% of the total macroinvertebrate biomass. Leptophlebia cupida and L. johnsoni together contributed approximately 50% of total biomass. Arthroplea bipunctata, Eurylophella cf. prudentalis, Siphlonurus mirus, S. rapidus and S. aerodromia were also important contributors. More than 80% of the growth of Leptophlebia, S. aerodromia and Siphlonurus occurred on the floodplain. These taxa use the stream channel primarily as a nontrophic refuge for the remainder of the year. Depending upon the year, mayfly production ranges from 1.6 to 2.3 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM)/m(2) of mean inundated wetland area over a 44 to 53 d period. When weighted by the length of the boundary between the sedge meadow and stream, this is equivalent to 7.5-14.0 g AFDM/m(2) of stream channel. Estimates of production for similar streams indicate that this is within the range expected for total annual production by macroin-vertebrates in the stream channel. Depending upon year, estimates of prey consumption by S. aerodromia ranged from 36% to essentially all prey production. Water temperature and predation by S. aerodromia appeared to be key factors influencing the temporal patterns of mayfly production in the Tomah Stream wetland. The physical linkage of the stream and floodplain by the natural flow regime, however, is the fundamental factor determining the productivity of this unusual river-floodplain community.									10	0	0	0	12	0	12			0003-9136			WOS:000179384900007

Most comparisons, however, focus either on output efficiency such as yields or on impacts of different nutrient management strategies on the sustainability of the agrosystems, and the impacts of each on the agricultural food webs and beneficial insects responsible for pest control - or outbreaks - has been often overlooked. While standard cropping models can explain if, why and how organic nutrient and crop management work and how they should be adapted to climate change, the lack of mechanistic models of agroecology prevents us from explaining why and how passive and active biocontrol and integrated pest management function, when they do not function, and what optimal management strategies could be employed.In this research, we show that agroecological food web models calibrated with field population dynamics data can be used to demonstrate the mechanisms behind food web dynamics that have been previously observed in the field. Results of scenario simulations show that chemical control provides immediate relief from pest pressures, but at high risk of later pest resurgence if control is not repeated; on the contrary, biological control requires more time to reduce pest populations to acceptable levels but with minimal risk of causing resurgence. In all cases, success of pest control measures is highly dependent on the date of action. In addition, the use of modelling tools to optimise biological control application dates led to much better control than either fixed date or pest population threshold-based applications. These analyses and resulting integrated pest management intervention recommendations are only possible with agroecological food web population dynamics models.We encourage future studies to examine more complex food webs from a variety of agroecosystems to test whether functional responses differ significantly, and hope that this approach will succeed in bringing agroecological food web predictive modelling to the level where it can routinely be used as a decision-making support tool, as hydrological and crop models are employed today.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000525396700001

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that water depth is an important factor in determining the spatial distribution of Diaphanosoma brachyurum Lievin, 1848 in response to fish predation. Quarterly monitoring was implemented at three water layers (i.e., water surface and middle and bottom layers) in 21 reservoirs located in the southeastern part of South Korea. D. brachyurum individuals were frequently observed at the study sites and exhibited different spatial patterns of distribution in accordance with the maximum depth of the reservoirs. In the reservoirs with a maximum depth of more than 6 m, high densities of D. brachyurum were observed in the bottom layers; however, in the shallower reservoirs (maximum depth < 6 m), D. brachyurum were concentrated in the surface layer. Moreover, during additional surveys, we observed a trend in which D. brachyurum densities increased as the maximum depth or macrophyte biomass increased. Gut contents analysis revealed that predatory fishes in each reservoir frequently consumed D. brachyurum; however, the consumption rate abruptly decreased in reservoirs where the maximum depth was more than 11 m or in the shallow reservoirs supporting a macrophyte bed. Interestingly, the reservoirs more than 11-m depth supported high densities of D. brachyurum in the bottom layer and in the surface macrophyte bed. Based on these results, reservoirs with a maximum depth of more than 11 m or those with a macrophyte bed may provide a refuge for D. brachyurum to avoid fish predation. Compared with other cladoceran species, D. brachyurum readily exploits various types of refugia (in this study, the deep layer or surface macrophyte bed), which may help explain why this species is abundant in various types of reservoirs									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1129-5767	1723-8633		WOS:000355151500019

Three categories of burrows (inactive, active and sealed) were sampled to examine possible relationships between burrow type and presence of R. marmoratus. Forty percent of the guts examined contained no food items, while the remaining 60% contained items of both terrestrial and aquatic origin. Capture rates among burrow categories did not vary significantly, and most collections consisted of 1 or 2 individuals per burrow. Mean standard length of fish within a burrow declined when more than 3 specimens were captured from a burrow. Supplemental observations on reproductive status and burrow water temperature are noted.									28	0	0	0	24	4	30			0378-1909			WOS:A1992HR82300008

Both warming and biotic interactions have been identified to magnify the effects of toxicants. Moreover, while biotic interactions may change the impact of toxicants, toxicants may also change the impact of biotic interactions. However, studies looking at the impact of biotic interactions on the toxicity of pesticides and vice versa under warming are very scarce. Therefore, we tested how warming (+4 degrees C), intraspecific competition (density treatment) and exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos, both in isolation and in combination, affected mortality, cannibalism, growth and heat tolerance of low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Moreover, we addressed whether toxicant exposure, potentially in interaction with competition and warming, increased the frequency of autotomy, a widespread antipredator mechanism. Competition increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos and made it become lethal. Cannibalism was not affected by chlorpyrifos but increased at high density and under warming. Chlorpyrifos reduced heat tolerance but only when competition was high. This is the first demonstration that a biotic interaction can be a major determinant of 'toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity'. Competition enhanced the impact of chlorpyrifos under warming for high-latitude larvae, leading to an increase in autotomy which reduces fitness in the long term. This points to a novel' pathway how transient pesticide pulses may cause delayed effects on populations in a warming world. Our results highlight that the interplay between biotic interactions and toxicants have a strong relevance for ecological risk assessment in a warming polluted world. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Early piscivory already was observed in age-0 zander of approximately 20 mm total length, but occurred only in the largest (> 40 mm TL) perch specimens during early summer. The onset of piscivory was triggered by high water temperatures in late spring which enhanced the growth rates of the predators relative to their prey, and by the drastic decline in zooplankton abundances during that time. Due to the lack of other prey fish, cannibalism and mutual intraguild predation dominated in piscivorous zander and perch. Early piscivory in both species was additionally favoured by the biomanipulation experiment in Bautzen reservoir due to (1) an abundant Daphnia population in spring which increased the growth rates of the predators, and (2) the coexistence of perch and zander in high densities which is uncommon in naturally-structured waters.					2nd International Percid Fish Symposium (PERCID II)2nd International Percid Fish Symposium (PERCID II)	AUG 21-25, 1995AUG 21-25, 1995	Finnish Game & Fisheries Res InstFinnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst	VAASA, FINLANDVAASA, FINLAND	44	0	0	0	44	0	46			0003-455X			WOS:A1996WB44500009

The first experiment was two-phased: (a) larvae stocked at densities of 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 larvae L-1 fed with Artemia nauplii and reared for 15days; (b) in phase 2, densities of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 40 juveniles L-1 were evaluated during feed training (20days). Mean water temperature in both phases was 28 degrees C. In the first phase of experiment 1, the different stocking densities did not affect fish growth or survival. In phase 2, growth was similar in all densities; however, survival was lower at higher densities. The increased density provided a rise in biomass and number of individuals produced in both phases. In the second experiment, two size-classes of feed-trained juveniles (30.22 +/- 1.84 and 34.66 +/- 2.41mm) were given pellets of two different diameters (1.2 and 2.6mm) for 20days. The largest juveniles fed the 1.2mm inert diet had higher final weights and lengths. Larviculture and feed training of L.alexandri can thus be performed successfully at high stocking densities of 300 larvae L-1 during the first 15days of feeding, and at densities of up to 40 juveniles L-1 during the 20days of feed training, respectively.									12	0	0	0	8	2	12			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000369998000008

In addition to natural challenges that force exercise (foraging, avoiding predators, etc.), sportfish species are also subjected to exercise when they are hooked by anglers, leading to metabolic energy costs that may impact fitness. While several studies have examined the physiological response of fish to capture in warm conditions, little work has examined this response under cold winter conditions when fish are targeted by ice-anglers. To fill this gap, we examined the metabolic impacts of exercise duration and air exposure on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, at a temperature typical for ice angling. Thirty-two bluegill were subjected to a simulated angling session which included either a light (30s) or exhaustive exercise procedure, followed by either 30s or 4min of air exposure. Fish were then assessed at 5 degrees C for the following metabolic metrics using intermittent-flow respirometry: standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope (AS), recovery time, and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Fish exercised to exhaustion had higher EPOC compared to lightly exercised fish, however EPOC was not affected by air exposure time. No other metrics were impacted by air exposure or exercise duration. These results are directly applicable to physiological outcomes for fish captured by ice-anglers during the winter and suggest that both low temperatures and low durations of exercise serve to keep metabolic costs low for fish angled during the winter months.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000449887400002

Integrating hypotheses of species, fishing, and climate relationships using ecosystem modeling								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				68	9			1553	1578		10.1139/F2011-080				SEP 2011	2011	We use a dynamic ecosystem model to evaluate the relative effects of fishing history, climate change, and predator prey interactions in determining biomass trajectories for 12 species groups ranging from marine mammals through commercially exploited fish and invertebrates in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Ecosystem model fits under six alternative hypotheses relating fishing, climate, and predation were evaluated. Fishing alone explained few GOA biomass trajectories; it was necessary to both estimate specific predator prey relationships and provide some mechanism for increased production. No single control hypothesis explained all species dynamics simultaneously, suggesting that in the GOA, there is no single main driver of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the alternative control hypotheses implied contrasting sets of predator prey relationships (estimated functional response parameters). Therefore, a single set of "best fit" parameters for a given control hypothesis is unlikely to be useful in forecasting. Future modeling efforts supporting ecosystem-based fishery management could retain multiple working models to accommodate complex forcing (fishing, keystone species production, and environmental) differentially affecting components of the ecosystem.									34	0	0	0	26	0	35			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000296169300004

Larval fishes that co-occur with these ''blooms'' should be at a growth and survival advantage compared with larvae that occur before or after the bloom, although this has been difficult to observe in many systems. We tested this potential advantage for larval (< 10 mm notochord length) striped bass Morone saxatilis and white perch M. americana in the Hudson River by examining consumption and feeding selectivities with respect to zooplankton blooms. The cladoceran Bosmina longirostris and large copepodite and adult copepods together composed 97.4% and 90.9% of larval striped bass and white perch diets, respectively. Peak consumption rates of Bosmina coincided with the bloom, whereas copepod consumption rates continued to increase throughout the sampling period. Selectivity for copepods was inversely related to selectivity for Bosmina and was high, except at those sites and times when Bosmina densities exceeded 14 animals/L. Per capita energy consumption was highest (0.75 and 0.39 J/individual for striped bass and white perch, respectively) after the bloom period, but specific consumption (energy consumed/mg wet weight fish) during and after the bloom were similar (2.39 versus 2.35 J/mg dry weight during the bloom versus after the bloom for striped bass and 2.58 versus 2.63 J/mg for white perch). Our energetics analyses indicate that different-sized fish experience different benefit-cost (consumption benefit: respiration cost) ratios, but strong trends exist with respect to the zooplankton bloom. Prebloom cohorts have the least available food and lowest metabolic costs (respiration). Postbloom cohorts have both high consumption and respiration rates due to increased temperatures. Cohorts coincident with the bloom have moderately high specific consumption rates and lower metabolic costs relative to late cohorts. We conclude that larval cohorts coincident with the bloom possess an energetic advantage relative to early cohorts but not relative to late cohorts.									41	0	0	0	42	0	43			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:A1997XU26600005

A half century assessment of hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, growth in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				31	4			755	766		10.1007/s12237-008-9060-9				SEP 2008	2008	During the last several decades, the waters of mid Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island have increased in temperature and decreased in chlorophyll concentration, and it is possible that these changes affected the growth and success of a common benthic filter feeder, the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria. We determined recent hard clam growth rates through a sclerochronological analysis and compared them to the rich historical record of Narragansett Bay growth rates in order to understand how these opposing changes influenced hard clam growth. We found no significant differences in short-term growth between 1985 and 2000. Long-term juvenile growth showed a significant decrease between the 1960s and 1990s, while long-term adult (mature) growth showed a significant increase over this same time period. While it is not clear why the changes in juvenile and adult growth rates differ, it appears as though the decrease in chlorophyll concentration, together with a change in phytoplankton community composition, increasing water temperature, and an increase in predator abundance, may all have influenced hard clam growth between the 1960s and the 1990s.									15	0	0	0	12	1	15			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000258153200013

We characterised the net impact of recent environmental changes on hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios), an apex predator found in continental slope habitats (>200 m depth) by using dendrochronology techniques to develop a multi-decadal record of growth from otoliths. Fish were sampled off temperate south-western Australia, a region strongly influenced by the Leeuwin Current, a poleward-flowing, eastern boundary current. The common variance among individual growth records was relatively low (3.4%), but the otolith chronology was positively correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.02) with sea level at Fremantle, a proxy for the strength of the Leeuwin Current. The Leeuwin Current influences the primary productivity of shelf ecosystems, with a strong current favouring growth in hapuku. Leeuwin Current strength is predicted to decline under climate change models and this study provides evidence that associated productivity changes may flow through to higher trophic levels even in deep water habitats.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			2045-2322			WOS:000351144900021	25761975

Exposure from hatch to short daylengths induced 4th instar diapause in over 50% of wild T. rutilus from southern Florida. Short daylengths and lower temperatures significantly reduced prey consumption rates. At a low frequency, diapausing larvae killed prey without consuming, which behavior increased with time in the 4th instar and was distinct from killing by prepupae. Termination of diapause by transfer of 4th instars to long daylengths was accompanied by an increase in prey consumption rate prior to pupation. Mean pupal masses were significantly affected by photoperiod and temperature treatments, confirming a correlation between heavier pupae and colder temperatures in the field. At 25 degrees C and 21 degrees C, female pupae were significantly larger than males, in contrast to no sexual size difference observed for continuous development at 27 degrees C. The composite index of performance (r'), an analog of the the per capita rate of increase, for diapausing cohorts was one-half to two-thirds of that estimated for non-diapausing cohorts, but temperature alone did not affect r' between 25 and 21 degrees C. Low rates of prey consumption during winter diapause may contribute to the relatively modest, albeit significant, effect of T. rutilus predation on mosquito abundance as estimated from long-term censuses of treeholes.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000074002600009

Japanese sea bass (JSB), Lateolabrax japonicus, is a coastal marine fish distributed in East Asian coastal waters, and is regarded as highly important for commercial and recreational fisheries, for marine and brackish water aquaculture as well as for stock enhancement. JSB is a typical estuarine dependent temperate fish, which spawns in shelf areas and coastal embayments and the larvae and juveniles are dispersed and transported into shallow nearshore habitats and estuaries where they spend the early life. In this paper, we provide insight into the early life history and ecology of JSB through a revision of the available information and using the data we obtained from a relatively long-term research. We review and discuss the distribution and habitat use, food and feeding, age and growth, mortality and recruitment of larval and juvenile JSB in coastal waters around Japan. We extend our discussions in all available dimensions: habitat-specific, ontogenetic, and spatio-temporal, and highlight the importance of nursery habitats. We also discuss the implications of early life history for recruitment of JSB as well as the possible effects of climate change. At the end, we point out potential areas for future research.									9	0	0	0	9	0	10			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000293297300003

Feeding and control of blue-green algal blooms by tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)								HYDROBIOLOGIA				568				111	120		10.1007/s10750-006-0023-5				SEP 2006	2006	Outbreak of blue-green algal blooms, with associated unsightly scum and unpleasant odor, occurs frequently in eutrophic lakes. We conducted feeding experiments to study ingestion and digestion of Microcystis aeruginosa by tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) under laboratory conditions and field testing to reduce Microcystis blooms by stocking tilapia in Lake Yuehu and other eutrophic waters in Ningbo, China between 2000 and 2003. Our results show that tilapia was capable of ingesting and digesting a large quantity of Microcystis. Digestion efficiency ranged from 58.6 to 78.1% at water temperature of 25 degrees C. Ingestion rate increased with increasing fish weight and water temperature. Intensive blooms occurred in Lake Yuehu in both 1999 and 2000. The lake was stocked with silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead (Aristichthys nobilis) and a freshwater mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii) at a total biomass of 9.8 g m(-3) in early 2001, and tilapia at 3-5 g m(-3) in April of 2002. From June to October, average phytoplankton density decreased from 897.6x10(6) cells l(-1) in 2000 to 291.7x10(6) cells l(-1) in 2001 and 183.0x10(6) cells l(-1) in 2002. Compared to 2000, the annual average phytoplankton biomass in 2001 and 2002 decreased by 48.6% and 63.8%, respectively. The blue-green algal biomass which made up 70% of the total phytoplankton biomass in 2000 was reduced to 22.1% in 2001 and 11.2% in 2002. Meanwhile, Secchi depth increased from 20-50 cm to 55-137 cm during the same time period. Similar results were observed in some other eutrophic waters. For example, algal bloom disappeared about 20 days after tilapia fingerlings were stocked (8-15 g m(-3)) to a pond in Zhenhai Park. Chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton production declined dramatically whereas water transparency increased substantially. However, the impacts of tilapia on nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in natural lakes need further investigation. Our studies revealed that stocking tilapia is an effective way to control algal blooms in eutrophic waters, especially in lakes where nutrient loading cannot be reduced sufficiently, and where grazing by zooplankton cannot control phytoplankton production effectively.									36	12	1	0	34	3	51			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000239393800009

The impact of aphids as pests is well characterized by their population growth rate, a parameter integrating their age-specific development, survivorship, and fecundity. These population parameters were measured at five constants temperatures on potted prune trees. Development rates increased with temperature up to an optimum. The relationship between development rate and temperature was described by linear and nonlinear models. Developmental threshold temperature was greater for the nonlinear model than for the linear model. Thermal requirement for development and maximum lethal temperature determined by these models were similar to those for other aphids. The greatest proportional survivorship of nymphs occurred at 26 degrees C. Mean daily fecundity was lowest at 14 degrees C and highest at 22 degrees C. Adult longevity decreased with temperature. Population growth rates for H. pruni were estimated from measurements of fecundity and development time and were highest at 22 degrees C. This is the first study to document the temperature dependence of the life history parameters for H. pruni and the first to generate a degree-day model for the prediction of phenological events.									1	0	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000298281700013	22299346

Such manipulation might be expected to lead to a seasonal variation in abundance and composition of fish and predation pressure on zooplankton, and consequently a seasonal change in the Cladocera populations. In this study, we examined the seasonal dynamics of cladocerans in a subtropical plateau lake in southwestern China, Lake Erh, in which a fishing moratorium was implemented in spring and early summer. Cladocerans showed a bimodal seasonal distribution linked to variations in predation pressure induced by the seasonal fishing moratorium. When predation was low in winter because of cool water temperatures and decreasing fish density, Daphnia galeata appeared in the water column and increased towards spring. The cladoceran peaked in the middle of the fishing moratorium, coinciding with a clear water phase. The feeding rate increased with temperature in the late moratorium, allowing planktivorous fish to strongly suppress large daphnids. Small cladocerans benefited from the reduced competition with large daphnids by increasing their numbers rapidly, which resulted in a second peak of cladocerans in the fishing season.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0018-8158			WOS:000318170200007

An informative parallel approach is to develop size-based methods. These capture the properties of food webs that describe energy flux and production at a particular size, independent of species' ecology. We couple a physical-biogeochemical model with a dynamic, size-based food web model to predict the future effects of climate change on fish biomass and production in 11 large regional shelf seas, with and without fishing effects. Changes in potential fish production are shown to most strongly mirror changes in phytoplankton production. We project declines of 30-60% in potential fish production across some important areas of tropical shelf and upwelling seas, most notably in the eastern Indo-Pacific, the northern Humboldt and the North Canary Current. Conversely, in some areas of the high latitude shelf seas, the production of pelagic predators was projected to increase by 28-89%.									186	0	0	0	132	0	191			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000309253400009	23007086

In Florida, CAS was first reported in Miami in 1996 and is now present in 43 Florida counties. Chemical control of CAS can be effective, but it is expensive, and insecticides must be frequently and regularly applied. Recent surveys of natural enemies in Thailand identified a new potential biological control agent of CAS. The objective of this study was to examine the temperature requirements and consumption rates of Phaenochilus kashaya Giorgi and Vandenberg (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Survival, developmental time and number of scales consumed by P. kashaya were measured at four constant temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C). In addition, adult longevity and consumption were recorded at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Phaenochilus kashaya completed development to adulthood at temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees C. The highest survival rate (48%) was obtained at 25 degrees C, and the accumulated degree-days for this species was 714. Phaenochilus kashaya is a voracious predator of CAS, consuming 380 scales during the larval stage and an estimated 4700 scales during the adult stage. Adult longevity varied from 59 days at 30 degrees C to 220 days at 20 degrees C for females, and 31 days at 30 degrees C to 148 days at 20 degrees C for males. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0.34 at 20 degrees C, which is high compared with other coccinellid species. According to this study, P. kashaya has the potential to be an effective biological control agent of the CAS in Florida.									2	1	0	0	3	0	3			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000315204600001		
J	Adrian, R; Wickham, SA; Butler, NM								Trophic interactions between zooplankton and the microbial community in contrasting food webs: the epilimnion and deep chlorophyll maximum of a mesotrophic lake								AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				24	1			83	97		10.3354/ame024083				MAR 28 2001	2001	Trophic interactions between the mesozooplankton and the microbial web (bacteria, protozoa) were studied in 2 in situ grazing experiments in the epilimnion and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) of a mesotrophic lake. We combined the Landry-Hassett dilution technique, whereby growth and grazing rates can be determined simultaneously, with the presence or absence of mesozooplanktun and additional nutrients. The epilimnion was cladoceran-dominated, and had relatively high ciliate, and low heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) abundance, while the DCM was rotifer-dominated, with fewer ciliates, but higher HNF abundance. Temperature differed by 13 degreesC (22 degreesC in the epilimnion; 9 degreesC in the DCM). The community differences between the epilimnion and DCM and the experimental manipulations had their greatest effects on ciliates, lesser effects on HNF, and essentially no net effect on bacteria. Bacteria growth rates and grazing losses did not differ between the epilimnion and DCM, despite the large differences in chlorophyll a and abiotic parameters, and were independent of nutrient addition or mesozooplankton removal. In contrast, the experimental manipulations produced relatively moderate changes in HNF growth rates and grazing losses in both the epilimnion and DCM. Although HNF densities were 3 times higher in the DCM than the epilimnion, epilimnetic HNF growth rates were approximately twice the rate found in the DCM. This was consistent with both higher temperature and a release from predation through indirect predatory effects on alternative HNF predators like ciliates. In the DCM, crustacean zooplankton were less abundant and therefore had smaller direct and indirect effects on the HNF, while the metazoan microzooplankton (mainly rotifers) were more important. Ciliate growth rates were lower in the epilimnion than in the DCM, but only in the epilimnion were ciliate growth rates enhanced by the addition of nutrients. The cladoceran-dominated community of the epilimnion was able to reduce ciliate growth rates to negative values, while in the rotifer-dominated DCM, ciliate growth rates were always positive along a predator density gradient. These results demonstrate that while ciliates, and to a lesser extent heterotrophic flagellates, respond quickly to changes in predator community composition, there are so many other direct and indirect pressures on bacteria that changes in the mesozooplankton community composition have no net effect on their adundance.									40	0	0	0	38	0	43			0948-3055			WOS:000168208300009

A number of short-and long-term experiments were conducted using waste sludge as the support material. The results demonstrated that improper aeration, temperature and worm density can remarkably affect worm growth and sludge reduction. Adult worms were more susceptible to variable environmental conditions. Continuous individual growth and development of the worms were observed under optimal process conditions: intermittent aeration with light intensity, a water temperature of 25 degrees C and an initial worm density in the range of 11-12 g/L. As calculated in a stage-structured population model, the asymptotic population growth rate of the worms was approximately 1 during a period of 117 days, which indicates a stable population size in the sludge predation system. The worm population exhibited a total sludge reduction rate of 297.0 +/- 10.1 mg-TSS/L/d. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

J	Murdoch, A.; Power, M.								The effect of lake morphometry on thermal habitat use and growth in Arctic charr populations: implications for understanding climate-change impacts								ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH				22	3			453	466		10.1111/eff.12039				JUL 2013	2013	Oxygen stable isotope temperature reconstruction methods were used to estimate mean experienced summer temperatures from growth zones within individual Arctic charr otoliths sampled from lakes with contrasting morphologies but proximate locations. For either lake, otolith-estimated temperatures were not significantly related to back-calculated growth. Fish in the smaller lake evidenced an increase in growth with age related to increasing use of cooler thermal habitats, with the use of thermal habitat possibly governed by predation risks. No relationships between age, growth or temperature were observed in the larger lake. Significant negative effects on back-calculated growth were observed due to increasing air temperatures in the smaller and shallower lake, possibly owing to warmer surface and littoral waters and a limited amount of preferred cool-water habitat. A similar relationship was not observed in the larger and deeper lake and indicated that resident Arctic charr were not as vulnerable to the impacts of temperature warming, possibly because of better behavioural thermoregulation opportunities in the cooler, deeper lake. Results provide evidence for differing climate-influenced growth outcomes among proximately located populations, with outcomes likely to depend on the differences among habitats, including lake size and morphometry which may act to influence fish densities in available preferred thermal habitats.									17	0	0	0	17	1	19			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000319872900011

The total development period (egg to adult) decreased linearly with increasing temperature (0.012 x T - 0.093: R-2 = 0.950). The total development threshold obtained from regression analysis was estimated to be 7.8 degrees C. Neoseiulas californicus required, on average, 83.3 DD to complete its development from egg to adult. Mean total and daily fecundity were highest at 25 degrees C, and were statistically different from those obtained at 20 and 30 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest at 25 degrees C (42.92 female/female). The longest mean generation period (T-0) occurred at 20 degrees C (12.96 days) and the shortest occurred at 30 degrees C (10. 12 days). The highest intrinsic Fate of increase (Gamma(r)) for N. californicus was observed at 25 degrees C (0.3373 female/female/day) and the lowest was at 20 degrees C (0.2467 female/female/day). The numbers of T. cinnabarinus eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adult males eaten by N. californictis were significantly different between prey densities. Regardless of prey density, N. californicus consumed more eggs and larvae than nymphs and adult males. The functional response data of N. californicus fit reasonably well to a type-II functional response of the Holling model. The number of eggs laid by female N. californicus was the highest when T. cinnabarinus eggs were offered as prey.									11	7	0	0	11	1	19			1300-011X	1303-6173		WOS:000264777300003

We examined the effects of two potential predators, two megalopal densities and two levels of habitat complexity on mortality of blue crab megalopae in laboratory experiments. Sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa Say consumed > 99% of megalopae in each of two 40-h trials. Grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio Holthuis consumed 37% of megalopae in the first trial, but only 5% in the second trial. No effect of habitat (sand or sand with artificial seagrass) or prey density on predation rates for either predator species was found. We then tested the hypothesis that megalopae undergoing metamorphosis to the first juvenile instar suffer higher mortality to grass shrimp predation than megalopae not in the process of metamorphosis. This hypothesis was rejected because predation rates did not differ between treatments with 0 or 95% metamorphosis. Higher predation rates (77.4%) by grass shrimp in the second set of experiments was associated with warmer water temperature, though temperature was not included formally as a factor in the design. These shrimps are seasonally abundant in Chesapeake Bay grass beds and capable predators of blue crab megalopae in the laboratory; field studies will be necessary to determine their impact on blue crab recruitment success.									38	1	0	0	39	2	41			0022-0981			WOS:A1991GL78900003

As a result of larvivorous activity for predation rate and temperature difference along kinds of native fishes, predation rate of Aphyocypris chinensis was the highest and predation rate of Misgurnus mizolepis was the lowest under the 23℃. Contrastively, predation rate of Aphyocypris chinensis and Odontobutis interrupta was the highest in least time. Predation rate of Misgurnus mizolepis was the lowest under the all temperature among six species fishes. Aphyocypris chinensis and Pseudorasbora parva in low, Carassius auratus, Misgurnus mizolepis and Odontobutis interrupta in bottom appeared high predation rate along the water depth. And predation rate of Oryzias sinensis was high as 95% at surface. As a result of measuring time taken to predate 50 mosquito larvae by 3 species fishes, two Aphyocypris chinensis took 10minutes, two Oryzias sinensis took 21min., two Misgurnus mizolepis took 45min. But one Aphyocypris chinensis and Misgurnus mizolepis took 8min., one Misgurnus mizolepis and Oryzias sinensis took 17min.				토종어류를 이용한 효율적인 생태학적 모기 방제 방법을 제안하기 위해 서산지역에 서식하는 토종어류를 이용하여 모기를 제어할 수 있는 최적 조건을 알아보았다. 어류 종류별에 따른 모기유충 포식률과 온도차에 따른 포식활동의 변화를알아본 결과, 32℃의 환경에서는 왜몰개가 가장 높은 포식률을 보였고 미꾸라지가 가장 낮은 포식률을 보였다. 반면 낮은온도의 환경에서는 왜몰개와 얼룩동사리가 가장 빠른 시간에 높은 포식률을 보인 반면, 미꾸라지는 온도와 상관없이 어류 6종 중에 모기유충 포식률이 가장 낮았다. 수심에 따른 어류 종류별 모기유충 포식률은 왜몰개와 참붕어가 수조의 아랫부분에서, 붕어와 얼룩동사리는 수조 바닥부분에서 높은 포식률을 보였고, 미꾸라지는 수조 바닥부분에서 모기유충을섭식하였다. 그리고 대륙송사리는 수표면에서 95%의 높은 포식률을 보였다. 서로 다른 위치에서 먹이활동을 하는 어류 3종을 선정하여 모기유충 50마리를 포식하는데 걸리는 시간을 측정한 결과, 왜몰개 2마리는 10분, 대륙송사리 2마리는 21분 그리고 미꾸라지 2마리는 45분이 걸렸다. 반면 미꾸라지와 왜몰개를 각각 1마리씩 넣었을 때는 8분, 미꾸라지와 대륙송사리를 넣었을 때는 17분이 걸렸다.					1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1229-6031			KJD:ART001746796

The length-weight relationship was given by TW = 0.0089 * TL3.163 (where TW = total weight in g: TL = total length in mm. Age at length data were inferred by modal analysis of the monthly length-frequency distributions. The parameters of the fitted Von Bertalanffy growth equation (with seasonal component, birth date on the 1st of January) were L-infinity = 13.8 cm, K = 0.73 yr(-1) t(o) = -0.22 yr, C = 0.95: W = 0.07. This growth rate is much higher than that described for northern Europe populations (where K is about 0.3 yr(-1)) and is probably associated with a shorter life span. Macroscopic examination of the gonads, and analysis of the monthly values of the gonadosomatic index, indicated that reproduction occurs in winter and early spring, with a maximum in February and March, when water temperatures are lowest. Individuals become sexually mature around 6-7 cm TL, a size that can be reached in less than 1 year. By contrast, individuals of this goby in the British Isles mature in their second or third year. Stomach contents were mainly small benthic invertebrates, predominantly crustaceans.					34th European Marine Biology Symposium34th European Marine Biology Symposium	SEP 13-17, 1999SEP 13-17, 1999	Univ AzoresUniv Azores	PONTA DELGADA, PORTUGALPONTA DELGADA, PORTUGAL	29	0	0	0	25	2	29			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000167736300013

Diet had no significant effect on defensive behavior of the caterpillars. The length of time that the caterpillars had fed (1 vs. 24 h) only influenced the frequency of caterpillars knocking the attacking stinkbugs away, with caterpillars knocking the stinkbugs away more often after 24 h of feeding. A second experiment tested the effects of diet (prey fed various concentrations of rutin), temperature (18-degrees-C and 28-degrees-C) and gender on consumption and growth parameters of fifth instar stinkbugs. At the cooler temperature, the bugs ate more, gained more weight but took twice as long to complete the stadium and consequently had reduced relative consumption and relative growth rates. Diet had no significant effect on biomass gained or stadium duration, but rutin-fed caterpillars did depress the stinkbugs' relative consumption rates. The effect of food quality on relative growth rate (RGR) was temperature dependent; rutin had no significant effect at the cooler temperature, but a high dose of rutin reduced RGR at the warmer temperature. Rutin had a greater negative impact on the females than the males. The effect of rutin on these predators was different than the effect on their prey (this study compared to Stamp (1990, 1992)): the negative effects of rutin seem to impact on the stinkbug's growth rather than on molting.									37	0	0	0	37	2	39			0029-8549			WOS:A1991GM33100021	28312145

Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were spawned in a hatchery and the spat were allowed to settle on small oyster shell fragments and on whole oyster shell. Two-month-old juveniles (15-18 mm) were deployed in polyethylene oyster bags on bottom and on underwater shell pads 20 cm and 40 cm above bottom. Oysters on whole shells were deployed outside bags in order to evaluate predation. Remote sensing data loggers were deployed near bottom and 40 cm above bottom to measure temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration. Growth (increase in height), survival, and condition of oysters in bags at the three experimental depths were compared. Temperature and salinity varied between 11.8 degreesC-32.8 degreesC and 4.4 pot-29.7 ppt, respectively. Periodic anoxic events, which lasted from a few hours to 6 days, were documented. Oysters at the three experimental levels grew to approximately 55 mm during the first year. Total mortality was observed at all three levels during the second summer when oxygen levels dropped to 0 mg L-1 for five consecutive days while water temperature was 28 degreesC. If the 17 months monitored during this study are typical, restoration of Fish River Reef will be difficult due to periodic anoxic events.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0730-8000			WOS:000166380100015

Individual foraging rate, predation risk. and physiologic stress vary along these gradients, resulting in growth-mortality trade-offs with depth. In the summer, Cancer borealis commonly forage in the shallow subtidal in the Gulf of Maine. C. borealis are the favored invertebrate prey of the Herring Gull and the Great Black-backed Gull, which consume 25%-50% of available C borealis (those in <1 m water) during each daytime low tide. We investigated three possible explanations for the presence of C. borealis in the risky gull-predation zone. First, we tested whether predation risk in the gull-predation zone was matched at deeper depths by subtidal predators; we found predation risk decreases with depth. Second, we tested whether water temperatures were warmer in the gull-predation zone and whether these warmer temperatures resulted in increased growth rates. We found that, while waters were warmer in the gull-predation zone, crabs grew at similar rates above and below the thermocline when fed similar diets. Finally, we tested for differences in food availability with depth and whether these differences influenced C. borealis growth rates. Our results suggest a growth-mortality trade-off, where increased food availability provides sufficient growth benefit to outweigh the risk of foraging at shallower depths.

Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X			Predation of freshwater fish in environments with elevated carbon dioxide								MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				68	9			1585	1592		10.1071/MF16156				2017	2017	Carbon dioxide (CO2) in fresh-water environments is poorly understood, yet in marine environments CO2 can affect fish behaviour, including predator-prey relationships. To examine changes in predator success in elevated CO2, we experimented with predatory Micropterus salmoides and Pimephales promelas prey. We used a two-factor fully crossed experimental design; one factor was 4-day (acclimation) CO2 concentration and the second factor CO2 concentration during 20-min predation experiments. Both factors had three treatment levels, including ambient partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2); 0-1000 mu atm), low pCO(2) (4000-5000 mu atm) and high pCO(2) (8000-10 000 mu atm). Micropterus salmoides was exposed to both factors, whereas P. promelas was not exposed to the acclimation factor. In total, 83 of the 96 P. promelas were consumed (n = 96 trials) and we saw no discernible effect of CO2 on predator success or time to predation. Failed strikes and time between failed strikes were too infrequent to model. Compared with marine systems, our findings are unique in that we not only saw no changes in prey capture success with increasing CO2, but we also used CO2 treatments that were substantially higher than those in past experiments. Our work demonstrated a pronounced resiliency of freshwater predators to elevated CO2 exposure, and a starting point for future work in this area.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000408576800002

The bioenergetics of a key forage fish in eastern Australia, yellowtail scad Trachurus novaezelandiae, was measured using static respirometry and bomb calorimetry to assess their trophic contribution as both predator and prey. The temperature-dependent standard metabolic rate (SMR) of yellowtail scad was 0.62 mgO(2) g (0.79) h(-1) and Q(10) of 1.98. The SMR was used with dietary information to calculate a minimum annual prey consumption of 17.8 g g(-0.79) y(-1) (at 20 degrees C), which is equivalent to an SMR-specific consumption:biomass ratio (Q:B-SMR) of 6.77 (100 g adult). This was incorporated into a standard energy balance model to estimate a total Q:B of at least 10.6 at 20 degrees C (or 7.2 at 14 degrees C), which is 2 to 3-fold larger than most values used to represent this species in ecosystem models. Implications of underestimating forage fish consumption could include errors in estimated prey biomass, ecotrophic efficiencies, or strength of top-down and bottom-up control. Yellowtail scad were a moderate-high value prey, with a mean energy density of 6 kJ g(-1) (+/- 0.97 s.d.). Energy density declined with body size and showed considerable inter-individual and spatial-temporal variation, indicating the potential to influence predator consumption rates at seasonal and fine spatial scales. This research highlights the value of measuring species-specific bioenergetics information for improving our understanding of trophic dynamics in marine ecosystems and models.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0967-0645	1879-0100		WOS:000554017400008

Factors affecting recruitment of young Colorado pikeminnow: Synthesis of predation experiments, field studies, and individual-based modeling								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				135	6			1722	1742		10.1577/T05-171.1				NOV 2006	2006	Predation experiments, field studies, and individual-based-model (IBM) simulations revealed factors that affected the survival and recruitment of early life stages of endangered Colorado pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius in the Green River basin, Utah and Colorado. Small-bodied. normative red shiners Cyprinella lutrensis attacked Colorado pikerninnow larvae an average of once per minute, and predation success approached 30% in laboratory aquaria. Attack rate was also high in mesocosm experiments; turbidity and alternative prey reduced predation success. Distributions of hatching dates derived from otolith daily increment analysis showed that large cohorts of Colorado pikerninnow larvae that hatched in the Green River in early summer had low survival to autumn and that the few survivors were fast growing. Larvae hatched in midsummer or later had higher survival. Autumn juveniles grew 12-73% faster than summer juveniles, which suggested differential mortality of slow-growing fish. The IBM simulations integrated size-dependent predator-prey relationships, Colorado pikeminnow life history information, temperature-dependent pikeminnow growth, Green River predator size-structure dynamics, seasonally variable Green River water temperatures, and turbidity and alternative prey availability effects; the simulations showed that red shiner predation interacting with environmental variables may significantly reduce age-0 pikeminnow recruitment in autumn. Recruitment and growth patterns from simulations and field observations were consistent and suggested that the IBM is useful in evaluating management scenarios. Experiments, field studies, and predictive modeling provided consistent evidence that interacting effects of predation and environmental variables, including flow fluctuations, may structure intra-annual growth and recruitment patterns of age-0 Colorado pikeminnow. Flow management to benefit growth and survival of young pikeminnow, particularly early hatching ones, and reduced normative predator abundance in Green River backwaters may enhance the Colorado pikerninnow populations.									46	0	0	0	43	0	46			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000243345500024

The model currently comprises differential and algebraic equations describing processes and forcing functions most important for a freshwater ecosystem. These include seasonal changes of solar radiation and water temperature, processes of algal and cyanobacterial population dynamics and nutrient uptake, water and chemical budgeting, stratification of the water column and sedimentation of suspended particles, and dynamics of detritus and its chemical constituents. Although it was shown previously for some years that a reasonable simulation of changes in most state variables could be achieved without accounting for fish and zooplankton, in other years, consideration of these compartments improved the fit between observations and model simulations dramatically. This was particularly true for the year 1998, when the high zooplankton numbers in spring appeared to prevent any significant development of the diatom population. The latter, however, bloomed during the first part of the summer (following a decrease in zooplankton counts) causing an unusually delayed major drop in ambient Si levels. As biogoechemical cycles of Si. P and N are interconnected through the dynamics of the primary producers, such a delay has serious implications for the functioning of an aquatic ecosystem model. Since changes in zooplankton dynamics are heavily dependent on the variability in fish recruitment, simultaneous consideration of the two components is helpful both for modelling overall dynamics of the lake ecosystem and for implementation of the biogeochemical regulation proposed previously.

J	Touchon, Justin Charles; Warkentin, Karen Michelle					Warkentin, Karen/0000-0002-7804-800X			Thermally contingent plasticity: temperature alters expression of predator-induced colour and morphology in a Neotropical treefrog tadpole								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				80	1			79	88		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01765.x				JAN 2011	2011	P>1. Behavioural, morphological and coloration plasticity are common responses of prey to predation risk. Theory predicts that prey should respond to the relative magnitude of risk, rather than a single level of response to any risk level. In addition to conspecific and predator densities, prey growth and differentiation rates affect the duration of vulnerability to size- and stage-limited predators and therefore the relative value of defences.2. We reared tadpoles of the Neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus with or without cues from a predator (Belostoma sp.) in ecologically relevant warm or cool temperatures. To track phenotypic changes, we measured morphology, tail coloration and developmental stage at three points during the larval period.3. Cues from predators interacted with growth conditions causing tadpoles to alter their phenotype, changing only tail colour in response to predators in warm water, but both morphology and colour in cool growth conditions. Tadpoles with predators in warm water altered coloration early but converged on the morphology of predator-free controls. Water temperature alone had no effect on tadpole phenotype.4. We demonstrate that seemingly small variation in abiotic environmental conditions can alter the expression of phenotypic plasticity, consistent with predictions about how growth rate affects risk. Predator-induced tadpole phenotypes depended on temperature, with strong expression only in temperatures that slow development. Thermal modulation of plastic responses to predators may be broadly relevant to poikilotherm development. It is important to include a range of realistic growth conditions in experiments to more fully understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of plasticity.									22	1	0	0	20	1	23			0021-8790			WOS:000285110600008	20964684	
J	Michimae, H; Wakahara, M								A tadpole-induced polyphenism in the salamander Hynobius retardatus								EVOLUTION				56	10			2029	2038						OCT 2002	2002	Larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus have two distinct morphs: normal and broad-headed, cannibal morphs. We performed three experiments to differentiate among the following hypotheses: The broad-headed morph is induced to allow: (1) feeding on nutritious conspecifics; (2) exclusion of strong competitors for food or space; or (3) feeding on large, tough prey when smaller prey items are unavailable. When newly hatched larvae were reared with a heterospecific, Rana pirica (an anuran amphibian) tadpoles, the broad-headed morph was induced more frequently compared with those reared with conspecifics. The phenotype expressed depended on the size of the tadpoles: The broad-headed morph occurred more frequently with small and the normal morph with large tadpoles. Metamorphosis occurred sooner in larvae fed conspecifics compared with those fed heterospecific tadpoles, and the mean growth rate of larvae fed conspecifics was significantly faster than that of those fed tadpoles, suggesting that the heterospecific tadpoles were less nutritive than the conspecifics. These results do not support the hypotheses that the broad-headed morph evolved for consuming conspecifics because of their better balance of nutrients or for excluding strong competitors for food or space. We tentatively conclude that the morph evolved to eat large, tough prey, including both conspecifics and heterospecific tadpoles. Because H. retardatus usually spawns very early in the spring in small ponds partially covered with ice and snow, newly hatched larvae may starve from the lack of proper food owing to extremely low water temperatures. Thus, the broad-headed morph of H. retardatus may represent a cold-habitat adaptation to overcome the severe circumstance when the only food items available are relatively large conspecifics or heterospecific tadpoles.									55	0	0	0	56	0	59			0014-3820			WOS:000179241700015	12449490

J	Raimondo, Sandy								Incorporating temperature-driven seasonal variation in survival, growth, and reproduction into population models for small fish								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				469				101	112		10.3354/meps09988				2012	2012	Seasonal variation in survival and reproduction can be a large source of prediction uncertainty in models used for conservation and management. A seasonally varying population model is developed that incorporates temperature-driven differences in mortality and reproduction for the small fish species the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus. A temperature-dependent growth rate function is developed for the von Bertalanffy constant, K, measured at various temperatures and fit to a logistic curve. The value of K at each temperature estimates the duration of mobile life stages. Stage-specific mortality is modeled as a power function of size that includes a temperature-dependent modification for extraneous ecological factors such as predation. Seasonal reproduction is described through temperature-dependent functions of embryo survival and stage duration. Model sensitivity analysis indicates that the largest influence on the population growth rate is K. Cessation of reproduction at lower temperatures is also a critical driver of population growth rate. Population projections used either seasonal or constant parameters for 16 hypothetical populations and demonstrated the potential for long-term error propagation in population projection using constant rates. Models used for conservation and management should employ realistic temporal resolution that will allow for seasonal effects of temperature on growth, reproduction, and survival to be incorporated into population projections.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000311553600008

The three sites represent different hydrodynamic regimes and are thus representative of a wider area. The model consists of a hydro-biogeochemical model (GOTM-ERSEM-BFM) coupled one way upwards to a size-structured model representing pelagic predators and detritivores (Blanchard et al., 2009). Thus, bottom-up pressures like changing abiotic environment (climate change, chemical cycling) will have an impact on fish biomass across the size spectrum. Here, we studied three different impacts of future conditions on fish yield: climatic impacts (medium emission scenario), abiotic ocean acidification impacts (reduced pelagic nitrification), and biotic ocean acidification impacts (reduced detritivore growth rate). The three impacts were studied separately and combined, and results showed that sites within different hydrodynamic regimes can respond very differently. The seasonally stratified site showed an increase in fish yields (occurring in winter and spring), with acidification effects of the same order of magnitude as climatic effects. The permanently mixed site also showed an increase in fish yield (increase in summer, decrease in winter), due to climatic effects moderated by acidification impacts. The third site, which is characterised by large interannual variability in thermal stratification duration, showed a decline in fish yields (occurring in winter) due to decline in the benthic system which forms an important carbon pathway at this site. All sites displayed a shift towards a more pelagic-oriented system.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000369524500007

Populations of M. edulis veliger larvae were investigated during two intensive periods in 1994 and 1995 in the embayment Knebel Vig, Denmark. The abundance of veligers varied from 1.7-40.4 ind. 1(-1) (1994) and 2.7-99.0 ind. 1(-1) (1995), generally declining throughout the sampling periods. Exponential disappearance rates for the M. edulis larvae were estimated as 0.06 d(-1) and 0.23 d(-1) for the two years, presumably caused by predation and settlement. In situ water temperature in the embayment was between 21-23 degrees C both years of investigation. In the laboratory, larvae were fed three different food rations: filtered sea water, natural sea water and natural sea water enriched with added algal culture (Isochrysis galbana) ad libitum. All laboratory experiments were conducted at 22+1 degrees C. Larval mean+/-s.e. shell lengths increased at significantly different rates (5% significance level) (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons) of 4.3+/-0.4 mu m d(-1) in filtered sea water, 9.1+/-0.2 mu m d(-1) in natural sea water, and 13.1+/-2.8 mu m d(-1) in enriched sea water, respectively. Under in situ conditions mean+/-s.e. shell growth rates were estimated as 5.6+/-0.3 mu m d(-1) and 7.6+/-1.3 mu m d(-1) in 1994 and 1995, respectively, the latter not significantly different from the laboratory growth rate performed with natural sea water. During the sampling periods, the chlorophyll a content of the bay water was 0.5-4.5 mu g 1(-1) (mean 2.8 mu g 1(-1)) which is well within the summer range of Danish coastal waters. In order to calculate the specific growth rates of the larvae, a shell length-carbon content regression was carried out with in situ larvae from 1994 giving W(mu gC)= 3.06 X 10(-8) X L(mu m)(2.88) (L = 175-450 mu m), where W is individual carbon content and L is shell length. Specific growth rates in situ were 0.062 d(-1) in 1994 and 0.064 d(-1) in 1995. In the laboratory, the specific growth rates were estimated to be 0.04 d(-1), 0.08 d(-1) and 0.11 d(-1) in filtered, natural and enriched sea water, respectively. The investigations lead us to suggest that growth of M. edulis veligers is commonly limited by food supply in the embayment during the summer. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science BN.

Understanding how development and environmental factors combine to influence swimming performance in aquatic organisms is particularly important during the transition from viscous to inertial environments. We measured the growth, development and ontogenetic changes in critical swimming speed (U-crit) in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae reared at three temperatures (7, 11, 15 degrees C). Temperature had a significant effect on growth rates (from 0.21 at 7 degrees C to 034 rnm.d(-1) at 15 degrees C), and larval morphology-at-length (increased dry weight (DW), body height and developmental rate at warmer temperatures). Temperature-dependent differences in morphology influenced swimming performance (e.g. the exponential increase in U-crit with increasing body size was faster at warmer temperatures). Larvae entered the transition to an inertial environment (Reynolds numbers >= 300) at body lengths between 15 (15 degrees C) and 17 mm (7 degrees C). Inter-individual differences in Ucrit were not related to nutritional condition (RNA.DNA(-1) or DNA.DW-1), but were negatively correlated to length-at-age, suggesting a trade-off between growth rate and locomotor activity. The Ucrit data from this and previously published studies suggest that Atlantic herring pass through four activity phases: 1) yolk-sac (<0.6 cm.s(-1)), 2) pre-flexion (0.6-3.0 cm.s(-1), temperature effect changes with body size), 3) post-flexion (up to 6-8 cm.s(-1), Q(10) similar to 1.8-2.0), 4) juvenile-adult period (20-170 cm.s(-1)).
