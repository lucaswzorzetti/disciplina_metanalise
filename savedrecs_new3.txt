Winter flounder (WF) and summer flounder (SF) abundance and growth were measured from May to October (2009-2013) and served as indicators for the use and quality of shallow-water habitats (water depth < 1.5-3.0 m). These bioindicators were then analyzed with respect to physiochemical conditions to determine the mechanisms underlying intraspecific habitat selection. WF and SF abundances were greatest in late May and June (maximum monthly mean = 4.9 and 0.55 flounder/m(2) for WF and SF, respectively) and were significantly higher in the tidal rivers relative to the bay and lagoons. Habitat-related patterns in WF and SF abundance were primarily governed by their preferences for oligohaline (0.1-5 ppt) and mesohaline (6-18 ppt) waters, but also their respective avoidance of hypoxic conditions (< 4 mg DO/L) and warm water temperatures (> 25 A degrees C). Flounder habitat usage was also positively related to sediment organic content, which may be due to these substrates having sufficiently high prey densities. WF growth rates (mean = 0.25 +/- 0.14 mm/day) were negatively correlated with the abundance of conspecifics, whereas SF growth (mean = 1.39 +/- 0.46 mm/day) was positively related to temperature and salinity. Also, contrary to expectations, flounder occupied habitats that offered no ostensible advantage in intraspecific growth rates. WF and SF exposed to low salinities in certain rivers likely experienced increased osmoregulatory costs, thereby reducing energy for somatic growth. Low-salinity habitats, however, may benefit flounder by providing refugia from predation or reduced competition with other estuarine fishes and macroinvertebrates. Examining WF and SF abundance and growth across each species' broader geographic distribution revealed that southern New England habitats may constitute functionally significant nurseries. These results also indicated that juvenile SF have a geographic range extending further north than previously recognized.									13	0	0	0	12	0	13			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000380268400015	27746705

Blanchard, Julia/0000-0003-0532-4824			Shifts in plankton size spectra modulate growth and coexistence of anchovy and sardine in upwelling systems								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				73	4			611	621		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0181				APR 2016	2016	Fluctuations in the abundance of anchovy (Engraulis spp.) and sardine (Sardinops scigax) are widespread in marine ecosystems, but the causes still remain uncertain. Differences between the planktonic prey availability, selectivity, and predation between anchovy and sardine have been suggested as factors influencing their dynamics. Using a dynamical multispecies size -spectrum model, we explore the consequences of changes in plankton size composition, together with intraguild predation and cannibalism, on the coexistence of these species. The shift towards smaller plankton has led to a reduction in the growth rate of both species. The effect was more deleterious on anchovy growth because it is unable to filter small particles. In model scenarios that included the effects of cannibalism and predation, anchovy typically collapsed under conditions favouring smaller sized plankton. The two species coexisted under conditions of larger sized plankton, although strong predation in conjunction with weak cannibalism led to the loss of sardine. The model provides new testable predictions for the consequences of plankton size structure on anchovy and sardine fluctuations. Further empirical work is needed to test these predictions in the context of climate change.

Development time of different immature stages decreased with increasing temperature, total egg-to-adult development time varied from 5.0 +/- A 0.13 to 17.5 +/- A 0.29 days. The lower thermal threshold for development was 9.7 +/- A 2.48A degrees C and the thermal constant from egg to adult was 111.1 +/- A 12.34 degree-days. Pre- and post-oviposition period and female longevity all shortened as temperature increased. The longest oviposition period was observed at 24A degrees C with 20.4 +/- A 1.13 days. At 20, 24, 28 and 32A degrees C, mated females laid on average 0.7 +/- A 0.08, 1.5 +/- A 0.04, 1.6 +/- A 0.11 and 1.5 +/- A 0.11 eggs per day, respectively, but no eggs were laid at 16A degrees C. Both the maximum fecundity (30.9 eggs per female) and the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r (m) = 0.166) were obtained at 28A degrees C. The results of this study indicated that a mass rearing of N. barkeri with A. ovatus as prey is feasible at the appropriate temperature.									24	0	0	0	25	0	28			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000297629000004	21792653

(Lepidoptera Erebidae) egg masses may have a significant role in the gypsy moth population regulation; therefore the understanding of this process is a key issue to prevent large scale damage. In this paper, we aimed to quantify the winter predation of egg masses by birds and to reveal what factors affect its efficiency in three types of Central European hardwood forests. We detected a predation frequency of 20%, i.e. every fifth egg masses was destroyed at some extent by birds, while the mean percentage of removed surface per attacked egg masses was 35%. We measured the size of egg masses, their location on the trunk and environmental variables. Factors affecting predation frequency as well as the removed surface differed among forest stands characterized by different tree species composition. In beech dominated forest, egg masses located on the north and northeast side of trees were more frequently attacked than egg masses located in any other directions. In hornbeam forests, the predation frequency increased with the height on the trunk, while in Turkey oak forests, only the size of egg masses had a significant positive effect on egg mass predation rate. Egg mass size also affected the percentage of removed surface. Tree species, tree diameter and shrub cover had no significant effect on egg mass predation. Thus, we can conclude that egg mass predation is influenced rather by egg mass location or size than by other habitat characteristics.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1721-8861			WOS:000413145200006		
J	Solomon, Joshua A.; Donnelly, Melinda J.; Walters, Linda J.								Effects of Sea Level Rise on the Intertidal Oyster Crassostrea Virginica by Field Experiments								JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH						68		57	64		10.2112/SI68-008.1				FAL 2014	2014	Sea level rise predictions for the next century range from 20 to 200 cm. Coupled with climate change-related increases in storm activity and associated alterations to sediment transport, estuaries and the organisms that live in them may be impacted. Along the eastern seaboard and gulf coast of the United States, Crassostrea virginica is an economically and ecologically important estuarine shellfish species. In an effort to understand potential effects of climate change on intertidal Crassostrea virginica, a novel method for manipulating inundation time of intertidal oysters was developed to examine effects of altering daily inundation time on sedimentation, predation, and competition. Called the oyster ladder, this method consists of suspending oyster shell as recruitment substrate at different elevations within the intertidal zone between mean low and mean high water. A six-week experiment was deployed during the peak of the 2011 oyster recruitment season at two sites within Apalachicola Bay, Florida. Data was collected on oyster recruitment, shell length, presence of sessile competitors, and sedimentation. Mean oyster shell length peaked at 95% time inundated, while recruitment peaked at 80% time inundation. Maximum sedimentation occurred at the highest inundation times (95% time inundation). The oyster ladder proved to be an effective tool for manipulating inundation times for C. virginica and suggests that sea level rise will have an effect on abundance, growth and survival of this of intertidal species.									8	0	0	0	5	0	8			0749-0208	1551-5036		WOS:000347145600009		
J	SOGARD, SM								VARIABILITY IN GROWTH-RATES OF JUVENILE FISHES IN DIFFERENT ESTUARINE HABITATS								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				85	1-2			35	53		10.3354/meps085035				AUG 1992	1992	Estuaries are vital nursery grounds for many marine fishes. During initial estuarine residence, juvenile fishes presumably benefit greatly from rapid growth, which can diminish susceptibility to size-selective predators. To measure the degree of variability in growth rates across different estuarine sites and habitats, I conducted caging experiments with 3 species (Pseudopleuronectes americanus, Tautoga onitis, and Gobiosoma bosci) at 4 sites in New Jersey, USA, estuaries. Two sites were in an estuary with dense eelgrass Zostera marina beds (Little Egg Harbor) and 2 were in an estuary lacking eelgrass but supporting patchy accumulations of the macroalgae Ova lactuca (Great Bay). Experiments were conducted in vegetated (either Zostera or Ulva) and unvegetated habitats at each site. Relative differences in growth rates among the 4 sites and between the 2 habitats were generally maintained across experiments within species, suggesting a consistency in foraging value. For all 3 species, growth was highest at a Great Bay site and generally lowest at a Little Egg Harbor site. The presence of vegetation (either Zostera or Ulva) was beneficial to growth only for T. onitis. Observed patterns in water temperature, sediment structure, and food availability were potential factors effecting the observed differences in growth rates. Natural densities of the 3 fish species were quantified and compared to the results of growth experiments to determine if there were trade-offs between rapid growth and other attributes of habitat quality. P. americanus and T. onitis were more abundant in areas supporting faster growth, but the complete absence of tautog from unvegetated substrates suggested some degree of habitat avoidance. A clear trade-off between habitat selection and foraging quality occurred for G. bosci; gobies were most abundant inside eelgrass beds, which supported the poorest growth rates.									186	1	0	0	161	0	188			0171-8630			WOS:A1992JP18400004

During the 3 week study, the mesocosm was manipulated periodically by the addition of nutrient (ammonium and phosphate) and fish predators (stickleback fry). During the experimental period, the mesocosm was sampled five times to measure metazooplankton grazing, using 5 mu m pre-filtered and C-14-labelled natural nanoplankton as food. In spite of the presence of fish, Meso biomass increased throughout the experimental period. The biomass of Meso was composed mostly of different copepodite stages of Eurytemora affinis and the cladoceran Bosmina longispina maritima, and that of Micro by biomass of copepod nauplii NIII-NVI. Owing to its larger biomass, Meso could exert a greater grazing pressure on the nanophytoplankton than could Micro. The biomass specific clearance rate (BSCR) was generally the same for both groups, occasionally higher in Micro. The BSCR increased during the first half of the study period, after which the clearance rates were depressed, coinciding with a sudden decrease in water temperature. The daily ingestion rate on nanophytoplankton (% of biomass as carbon) varied between 3 and 96% for Meso, and between 4 and 130% for Micro. When integrated over the study period, grazing on nanophytoplankton was estimated to provide about 60% of the carbon requirements of metazooplankton, respectively; thus, protists were probably important food. The overall gross growth efficiency for the whole metazooplankton community was estimated to be 32%. Meso and Micro grazing was estimated to account for 8 and 2% of primary production, indicating that they were not able to control phytoplankton primary production enriched by nutrient additions.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:A1997XE19900001		
J	Hampton, Paul M.								Ecology of the Lesser Siren, Siren intermedia, in an Isolated Eastern Texas Pond								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				43	4			704	709		10.1670/08-168.1				DEC 2009	2009	The Lesser Siren (Siren intermedia) is a fully aquatic salamander with functionally limited overland dispersal. Details of the ecology of this species throughout its geographic range and diversity of habitats are limited. In this study, I investigated the ecology of a presumably isolated population of S. intermedia in eastern Texas. The conservative estimated population density was 0.33 sirens/m(2) with a standing crop biomass of 9.66 g/m(2). Growth rates averaged 0.022 mm/day in total length, slightly slower than other populations. Growth rate was not significantly different between males and females, nor was it correlated with size. The diet of the study population included at least 10 different taxa, of which tadpoles and snails (Order Basommatophora) were the most important prey. Like other populations, activity was highest during late winter and early spring, which coincides with the breeding season. The abundance of siren captures was weakly influenced by water temperature but not correlated with precipitation. Bite marks are hypothesized to be a result of siren courtship behavior. The abundance of males and females captured with fresh bite marks was significantly correlated with the number of gravid females. Because sirens are predatory generalists and represent a significant proportion of biomass in many aquatic environments, it is important to understand siren ecology throughout its geographic range and broad use of habitat types.									7	0	0	0	8	0	8			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000273444800019

Mobile stages of L. salmonis in the pen with wrasse remained low (1-8 per fish) with no requirement for chemical treatment compared with a heavy infestation (up to 50) on the control pen. Wrasse selectively preyed on the larger lice stages, mainly adults and female pre-adult Stage II, and this was measured and statistically tested using Pearre's selection index. The mean number of mobile L. salmonis consumed daily by an individual wrasse varied from 26-46 at water temperatures of 10(-12)-degrees-C and daily food consumption was 1. 18-2.72% of body weight.									26	0	0	0	24	0	27			0044-8486			WOS:A1994NM17100001

Furthermore, ectotherms acclimate to prevailing thermal conditions by adjusting physiological parameters, which often implies costs to other fitness-related parameters. Both predators and prey may therefore pay thermal acclimation costs following exposure to suboptimal temperatures. However, these costs may be asymmetrical between predator and prey, and between the predator and different species of concurrent prey. We investigated whether thermal pre-exposure affected subsequent kill rate and predator fitness when foraging on prey that differ in ease of capture, and whether changes were primarily caused by predator or by prey pre-exposure effects. Specifically, we were interested in whether there were interactions between predator pre-exposed temperature and specific prey. Using the mesostigmatid mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer as a generalist predator and the collembolans Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata as prey, we measured the impact of present temperature, predator pre-exposure temperature, prey pre-exposure temperature (all 10 or 20 degrees C), prey species, and all interactions on prey numbers killed, predator eggs produced, and exploitation of killed prey in a full factorial design. Mites killed P. fimata in equal numbers independent of the presence of F. candida, but killed F. candida when P. fimata was absent. Mite kill rate and reproduction were significantly affected by mite pre-exposure temperature and test temperature, but not by prey pre-exposure temperature. Significantly more of the slower prey was killed than of the quicker prey. Importantly, we found significant synergistic negative interaction effects between predator cold pre-exposure and hunting prey of higher agility on predator kill rate and reproduction. Our findings show that the negative effects of cold and cold pre-exposure on kill rate and reproduction may be more severe when predators forage on quick prey. The study implies that predator cold exposure has consequences for specific prey survival following cold due to altered predation pressures, which in nature should influence the specific prey population dynamics and apparent competition outcomes. The findings exemplify how not only current but also preceding conditions affect ecological interactions, and that effect strength depends on the species involved.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000458963200007	30303532

Recent applications of spatially-explicit models have used an arbitrary spatial scale and have assumed a fixed foraging efficiency. We evaluated the effects of spatial scale, predator foraging efficiency (combined probabilities of prey recognition, attack, capture, and ingestion), and predator spatial distribution on estimates of mean growth rate potential of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. We used actual data on prey densities and water temperatures taken from Lake Ontario during the summer, as well as, simulated data assuming binomial distribution of prey. Results show that a predator can compensate for low foraging efficiency by inhabiting the most profitable environments (regions of high growth rate potential). Differences exist in predictions of growth rate potential across spatial scales of observation and a single scale may not be adequate for interpreting model results across seasons. Continued refinements of this modeling approach must focus on the assumptions of stationary distributions of predator and prey populations and predator foraging tactics.									32	3	0	0	33	0	35			0378-1909			WOS:A1996TZ51600009

A mechanistic framework could better predict these different temperature-disease outcomes. However, such a framework remains challenging to develop, due to the nonlinear and (sometimes) opposing thermal responses of different host and parasite traits and due to the difficulty of validating model predictions with observations and experiments. We address these challenges in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) system. We test the hypothesis that warmer temperatures promote disease spread and produce larger epidemics. In lakes, epidemics that start earlier and warmer in autumn grow much larger. In a mesocosm experiment, warmer temperatures produced larger epidemics. A mechanistic model parameterized with trait assays revealed that this pattern arose primarily from the temperature dependence of transmission rate (), governed by the increasing foraging (and, hence, parasite exposure) rate of hosts (f). In the trait assays, parasite production seemed sufficiently responsive to shape epidemics as well; however, this trait proved too thermally insensitive in the mesocosm experiment and lake survey to matter much. Thus, in warmer environments, increased foraging of hosts raised transmission rate, yielding bigger epidemics through a potentially general, exposure-based mechanism for ectotherms. This mechanistic approach highlights how a trait-based framework will enhance predictive insight into responses of infectious disease to a warmer world.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000428287200004	29570399

The allopatric brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in the tarn Royrtjonna (27 ha) fed mainly on organisms at the lake surface, crustacean plankton, Trichoptera and Chironomidae. Only 5% of the trout reached an age of 6 years and a length of 25 cm. Sexual maturation started at age 3 and a length of 14 cm. Through mark - recapture technique the number of trout >10 cm was estimated to 115 ha(-1). Growth, fish length frequencies and sexual maturation of the sympatric brown trout and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in Lake Storgronningen (530 ha) were not much different. The Storgronningen charr fed chiefly on zooplankton which by volume represented 33% for the trout. The food consumption of Storgronningen trout was at maximum in July with 2.06 mg food (d.w.) per g live fish and for charr in September with 1.26 mg food. The maximum size-independent growth rate of trout was 5.2% day(-1) in late June, and for charr 4.1% day(-1) in late July. Seventy percent of their seasonal growth took place before 15 August. The charr stayed mainly deeper than 3-4 m, at water temperatures <15 degrees C. Brown trout stayed mainly the littoral zone and in near surface water of the pelagic. The number of pelagic charr was estimated hydroacustically to 50 ind. ha(-1). The charr spawn in the lake. Mean numbers of juvenile trout in the two largest tributaries were 26 and 48 per 100 m(2). Their annual length increment was 2.8-3.4 cm. No indication of acidification or other human induced impacts were found. The lakes and their tributaries represent complex aquatic systems, representative for pristine oligotrophic Norwegian lowland lakes.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:A1997XV67900010

When fed bacteria without food limitation, both isolates were able to grow at temperatures from -1.8 to 20-degrees-C, with maximum growth rates of 3.28 day-1 at 15-degrees-C and 2.28 day-1 at 12.3-degrees-C for the Newfoundland and the Arctic isolates, respectively. Ingestion rates increased with temperature from 14 to 62 bacteria flagellate-1 h-1 for the Newfoundland isolate and from 30 to 99 bacteria flagellate-1 h-1 for the Arctic isolate. While temperature did not affect cell yields (number of protozoa produced divided by number of bacteria consumed), it affected flagellate sizes. This differential effect of temperature on cell yield and cell size resulted in a changing gross growth efficiency (GGE) in terms of biovolume; colder temperatures favored higher GGEs. The comparison of Q10 values for growth rates and ingestion rates between the isolates shows that the Arctic isolate is better adapted to extremely cold temperature than the Newfoundland isolate. At seawater-freezing temperature (-1.8-degrees-C), the estimated maximum growth rates and maximum ingestion rates are 0.81 day-1 and 30 bacteria flagellate-1 h-1 for the Arctic isolate and 0.54 day-1 and 12 bacteria flagellate-1 h-1 for the Newfoundland isolate. Our findings about psychrophilic nanoflagellates fit the general characteristics of cold-water-dwelling organisms: reduced physiological rates and higher GGEs at lower temperatures. Because of the large and persistent differences between the isolates, we conclude that they are ecotypes adapted to specific environmental conditions.									65	1	0	0	59	0	68			0099-2240			WOS:A1992HC49400024	16348647

The highest abundance of this species was observed in March, when densities varied widely, from 20 to 600 ind. m(-3). Population parameters were calculated, such as birth rate (from 0.25 to 0.90 ind.(-1).day(-1)), growth rate (from -1.30 to 2.09 day(-1) and death rate (from -1.6 to 1.9 day(-1)) Start of population could be attributed to the increase of temperature and to the hatching of resting eggs. The population collapsed in fall-winter, as result from the combined effects of different factors: decrease of water temperature (from 27degreesC to 21degreesC) influencing egg development time (from 2.27 to 3.28 days); predation pressure by chaetognaths (Max. 100 ind. m(-3)) and switch of population from parthenogenic to sexual reproduction. Horizontal transport of water by tidal currents contributed partially to the reduction of population density.									8	0	0	0	11	3	12			1516-8913	1678-4324		WOS:000225349100006

Here we identify direct and indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data from the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage to the next (eggs-larvae-juveniles-recruits), we find evidence for both bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring, leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early growth and survival through several mechanisms, only some of the identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate impacts are barely propagated to later life stages when density dependence is strong.									37	0	0	0	31	0	37			0962-8452			WOS:000283448800005	20538646

Here we evaluate experimentally two alternative hypotheses suggested to explain life history shifts induced by raised temperature using parthenogenetic clones from two Daphnia species. Explanation 1 proposes that the life history shifts could be adaptive if increased temperature is used as an indirect cue to indicate increased risk from size-selective predators. Explanation 2 proposes that at larger body size energy becomes more limiting as temperature increases because of a less favourable assimilation: metabolism balance. In a factorial laboratory experiment we examine the effects of three rearing temperatures on the growth and reproductive traits of Daphnia raised in water with fish kairomone, Chaoborus kairomone, or in uncontaminated water. None of the three predictions of explanation 1 were met by the data. In both D. pulex and D. curvirostris, and some other published studies, data suggested that at larger body sizes the sum of growth and reproduction was lower at high temperature, supporting our prediction from explanation 2. However, we propose a novel third explanation based on new evidence of temperature-dependence in both reproductive effort and cost in D. pulex.									37	1	0	0	33	0	38			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000188987800001

The highest densities of D. labrax were recorded in shallow areas. Dicentrarchus labrax density was also significantly related to water temperature and salinity, but the variation pattern was not linear. The 0-group individuals of this species first occurred on the nursery ground in May and the highest densities were recorded in June. Diet of 0-group D. labrax was mainly composed of crustaceans, the most important food items being Decapoda, Mysidacea and Isopoda. Feeding activity increased during summer. Short-term variations were related to the period of the day and tidal cycle. The growth rate determined for 0-group D. labrax was higher than those reported for the UK and northern France, and was similar to those obtained in eastern Mediterranean.									54	0	0	0	45	0	54			0025-3154			WOS:000171408300015

Recent studies have suggested that experimental ocean acidification (OA) can alter the feeding performance of marine calcifying invertebrates, but results have been inconsistent. While several reviews pertaining to the biological effects of OA exist, none provide a synthesis of OA effects on feeding performance. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of published experiments testing for effects of elevated CO2 on feeding rates of marine calcifying invertebrates. Results revealed that suspension-feeding molluscs and predatory and grazing echinoderms experienced depressed feeding rates under elevated CO2, while arthropods appeared unaffected; larval and juvenile animals were more susceptible to CO2 effects than adults. Feeding strategy did not appear to influence the overall taxonomic trend, nor did habitat, although exposure time did have an effect. AIC model selection revealed that Phylum best predicted effect size; life stage and exposure time were also included in candidate models. Based on these results, we synthesize potential physiological attributes of different taxa that may drive OA sensitivities in feeding rates, which could potentially result in community-level impacts. We also discuss CO2 effects on calcifier feeding in the context of elevated temperature and other global marine change stressors, and highlight other areas for future research.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000437439300001

The day and night acoustic surveys revealed majority of pelagic fish present in the upper 5 m of the water column. The highest gillnet catches of planktivorous fish in epipelagic waters were obtained in May and August. The lowest fish catches were recorded in April and October which resulted in significant positive correlation between the gillnet catch per unit effort and water temperature. The majority of captured fish were adults of three cyprinid species: roach Rutilus rutilus, bleak Alburnus alburnus and bream Abramis brama. In the early spring the food of the three species was diversified: bream consumed primarily cyclopoid copepods, bleak fed on terrestrial insects and gut content of pelagic roach consisted mainly of littoral food components algae and detritus. In the late spring and summer however, the diets of all three cyprinids were predominated by large cladocerans, thus proving the use of open water habitat abundant in this prey.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0139-7893			WOS:000259599200017

Ciliates from 111 taxa were detected, including new records of 24 species for the Baltic Sea. The ciliate taxa were grouped into size-categories and trophic guilds and their species composition, abundance and biomass were monitored in different seasons. Two distinct associations replaced each other during seasonal succession at water temperatures 512C. During the warm season (late AprilOctober) ciliate communities were composed essentially of pico- and nano-filterers (mostly algivorous) that became less important in the cold season (Octoberearly April). The predator, Monodinium balbiani, and bactivorous peritrichs were characteristic of the warm season, while in the cold season, other predatory (Lacrymaria coronata group) and bactivorous (Cyclidium spp., Aspidisca sp., Chilodonella sp.) ciliates occurred. The most abundant size groups were small ciliates (2030 m) and nanociliates (20 m). A proportion of large ciliates (60 m) increased in the cold season due to the appearance of benthic species in the plankton. Total ciliate abundance and biomass ranged 0.1210.3 10(3) ind L-1 and 0.353.3 g C L-1, respectively. An unusual winter peak of the ciliate Trithigmostoma sp. was observed (32.8 g C L-1) although generally the overall ciliate numbers decreased in the cold season.									21	0	2	0	23	2	27			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000300228000003		
J	Fritsches, KA; Brill, RW; Warrant, EJ								Warm eyes provide superior vision in swordfishes								CURRENT BIOLOGY				15	1			55	58		10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.064				JAN 11 2005	2005	Large and powerful ocean predators such as swordfishes, some tunas, and several shark species are unique among fishes in that they are capable of maintaining elevated body temperatures (endothermy) when hunting for prey in deep and cold water [1-3]. In these animals, warming the central nervous system and the eyes is the one common feature of this energetically costly adaptation [4]. In the swordfish (Xiphias gladius), a highly specialized heating system located in an extraocular muscle specifically warms the eyes and brain up to 10degreesC-15degreesC above ambient water temperatures [2, 5]. Although the function of neural warming in fishes has been the subject of considerable speculation [1, 6, 7], the biological significance of this unusual ability has until now remained unknown. We show here that warming the retina significantly improves temporal resolution, and hence the detection of rapid motion, in fast-swimming predatory fishes such as the swordfish. Depending on diving depth, temporal resolution can be more than ten times greater in these fishes than in fishes with eyes at the same temperature as the surrounding water. The enhanced temporal resolution allowed by heated eyes provides warm-blooded and highly visual oceanic predators, such as swordfishes, tunas, and sharks, with a crucial advantage over their agile, cold-blooded prey.									114	3	0	0	106	0	121			0960-9822	1879-0445		WOS:000226715000025	15649365

Both abiotic stress and species interactions can limit populations and potentially set range boundaries, but we have a poor understanding of when and where each is most critical. A commonly cited hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, posits that abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) are stronger determinants of range boundaries in apparently abiotically stressful areas ("stress" indicates abiotic factors that reduce population growth), including desert, polar, or high-elevation environments, whereas species interactions (e.g., herbivory, competition) play a stronger role in apparently less stressful environments. We tested a core tenet of this hypothesis-that population growth rate is more strongly affected by species interactions in less stressful areas-using experimental manipulations of species interactions affecting a common herbaceous plant, Hibiscus meyeri (Malvaceae), across an aridity gradient in a semiarid African savanna. Population growth was more strongly affected by four distinct species interactions (competition with herbaceous and shrubby neighbors, herbivory, and pollination) in less stressful mesic areas than in more stressful arid sites. However, contrary to common assumptions, this effect did not arise because of greater density or diversity of interacting species in less stressful areas, but rather because aridity reduced sensitivity of population growth to these interactions. Our work supports classic predictions about the relative strength of factors regulating population growth across stress gradients, but suggests that this pattern results from a previously unappreciated mechanism that may apply to many species worldwide.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0027-8424			WOS:000423091400049	29284748

Climate variation is filtered differently among lakes to influence growth of juvenile sockeye salmon in an Alaskan watershed								OIKOS				123	6			687	698		10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00801.x				JUN 2014	2014	The physical landscape filters regional climate variation such that the environmental conditions an organism experiences are unique to the characteristics of local habitat features. While it has become apparent that populations may show watershed-specific responses to changing climate within a geographic region, the population dynamics of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. suggest that within watershed climate filtering is also important. Growth provides an integrated measure of habitat quality capturing the overall response of individuals to climate as filtered by their habitat and their response to the biological interactions in the ecosystem. We used two different long-term datasets, scales from returning adults and juvenile length measurements, to assess the response of sockeye salmon O. nerka growth during their juvenile life phase to single and integrated measures of climate within a watershed between 1950 and 2010. Scale growth showed evidence for differences among stocks rearing in different lake habitats within the same Alaska Peninsula watershed. These lakes have substantially different morphometry and showed opposite responses to changes in spring and fall air temperatures. Juvenile length data were also available for one of these stocks and indicated that density effects were relatively weak in contrast to the effects of temperature. While direct measures of juvenile length and measures derived from adult scales showed some similarity in their trends over time, they indicated opposite effects of air temperature. Throughout the range of Pacific salmon, climate change is altering freshwater ecosystems through changes to temperature, precipitation and associated variables. These data suggest that sockeye salmon populations are experiencing climate filtering at a sub-watershed scale. Maintaining connected, heterogeneous landscapes will therefore likely be important for providing productive habitat for sockeye salmon across a range of climate conditions that they are going to experience under new climate regimes.									7	0	0	0	7	0	10			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000335721400005

We assessed how changes in mean and standard deviation of sea surface temperature (SST), frequency and magnitude of warm SST extreme climatic events (ECE) influenced the stochastic population growth rate log(lambda(s)) and age structure of a black-browed albatross population. For changes in SST around historical levels observed since 1982, changes in standard deviation had a larger (threefold) and negative impact on log(lambda s) compared to changes in mean. By contrast, the mean had a positive impact on log(lambda s). The historical SST mean was lower than the optimal SST value for which log(lambda s) was maximized. Thus, a larger environmental mean increased the occurrence of SST close to this optimum that buffered the negative effect of ECE. This 'climate safety margin' (i.e. difference between optimal and historical climatic conditions) and the specific shape of the population growth rate response to climate for a species determine how ECE affect the population. For a wider range in SST, both the mean and standard deviation had negative impact on log(lambda s), with changes in the mean having a greater effect than the standard deviation. Furthermore, around SST historical levels increases in either mean or standard deviation of the SST distribution led to a younger population, with potentially important conservation implications for black-browed albatrosses.This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000400921300009	28483873

Because environmental stress depends on both intensity and duration, understanding the consequences of stress requires experiments that simultaneously manipulate both dimensions. In Apalachicola Bay, Florida (U.S.A.) the southern oyster drill (Stramonita haemastoma) is a major predator of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Drill predation appears to be salinity-dependent: in a recent field study, predation rates were positively correlated with salinity. Salinity in the bay is typically high (> 20) during the dry summer months, conditions that favor both oysters and the drill. However, periodic freshets can dramatically reduce salinity, which inhibits (or kills) drills, but not oysters. In this study, we used field measurements of salinity and drill densities to inform mesocosm experiments. We investigated the specific combinations of intensity and duration of low-salinity stress that inhibit drill predation. In these experiments, more intense salinity reductions reduced feeding both during and after the low-salinity stress event. During the event, longer durations (15 d) were necessary for mild salinity reductions (-5) to reduce the feeding rate by the same amount as a short (5 d) exposure of more intense (-10 or -15) salinity reduction. Both conditions may create a predation refuge for oysters, consistent with field observations. Given that the recent collapse of the Apalachicola Bay oyster population was preceded by several years without low-salinity events to inhibit predation, our results provide a mechanism by which a predator may have contributed to the loss of a historically productive and sustainable fishery.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000456720900007

The implications of this rapid change for lake ecosystem function remain poorly understood. To assess how freshwater communities respond to such profound changes in their habitat and resource availability, we conducted a space-for-time analysis of food-web structure in 30 lakes situated across a temperature-productivity gradient equivalent to the predicted future climate of subarctic Europe (temperature +3 degrees C, precipitation +30% and nutrient +45 mu g L-1 total phosphorus). Along this gradient, we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon from 25 to 75% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. This shift was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic detritus by benthic primary consumers and was not accompanied by increased pelagic foraging by higher trophic level consumers. Our data also revealed a convergence of the carbon isotope ratios of pelagic and benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most productive lakes indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon into aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies. These results, reflecting changes along a gradient characteristic of the predicted future environment throughout the subarctic, indicate that climate and land use driven eutrophication and browning are radically altering the function and fuelling of aquatic food webs in this biome.									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000466402100005	30793453

Foraging and predation risk for larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Lake Superior: A modelling synthesis of empirical survey data								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				294				71	83		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.09.009				DEC 24 2014	2014	The relative importance of predation and food availability as contributors to larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) mortality in Lake Superior were investigated using a visual foraging model to evaluate potential predation pressure by rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and a bioenergetic model to evaluate potential starvation risk. The models were informed by observations of rainbow smelt, larval cisco, and zooplankton abundance at three Lake Superior locations during the period of spring larval cisco emergence and surface-oriented foraging. Predation risk was highest at Black Bay, ON, where average rainbow smelt densities in the uppermost 10 m of the water column were >1000 ha(-1). Turbid conditions at the Twin Ports, WI-MN, affected larval cisco predation risk because rainbow smelt remained suspended in the upper water column during daylight, placing them alongside larval cisco during both day and night hours. Predation risk was low at Cornucopia, WI, owing to low smelt densities (<400 ha(-1)) and deep light penetration, which kept rainbow smelt near the lakebed and far from larvae during daylight. In situ zooplankton density estimates were low compared to the values used to develop the larval coregonid bioenergetics model, leading to predictions of negative growth rates for 10 mm larvae at all three locations. The model predicted that 15 mm larvae were capable of attaining positive growth at Cornucopia and the Twin Ports where low water temperatures (2-6 degrees C) decreased their metabolic costs. Larval prey resources were highest at Black Bay but warmer water temperatures there offset the benefit of increased prey availability. A sensitivity analysis performed on the rainbow smelt visual foraging model showed that it was relatively insensitive, while the coregonid bioenergetics model showed that the absolute growth rate predictions were highly sensitive to input parameters (i.e., 20% parameter perturbation led to order of magnitude differences in model estimates). Our modelling indicated that rainbow smelt predation may limit larval cisco survival at Black Bay and to a lesser extent at Twin Ports, and that starvation may be a major source of mortality at all three locations. The framework we describe has the potential to further our understanding of the relative importance of starvation and predation on larval fish survivorship, provided information on prey resources available to larvae are measured at sufficiently fine spatial scales and the models provide a realistic depiction of the dynamic processes that the larvae experience.

We combined field observations and feeding experiments to quantitatively evaluate the potential feeding capability of the black scraper Thamnaconus modestus on giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai in a jellyfish-abundant area. Underwater observations revealed that shoals of T. modestus fed voraciously on jellyfish when the jellyfish were close to the fish's seaweed habitat. Gut contents of field-collected T. modestus almost exclusively consisted of jellyfish. In tank trials, feeding activity of black scraper was high when light intensity was between about 1.1 lx and 50 x 10(3) lx. The estimated feeding speed of T. modestus on the jellyfish in the Sea of Japan when the jellyfish bloom occurred was 10.0 +/- 2.0 times fish body weight per day. The results support the prediction that T. modestus and probably other coastal medusivorous fishes have a substantial capability to eliminate jellyfish blooms. Considering that they are highly dependent on seaweed bed, protection of such habitats for these medusivores may be the most cost-efficient control method for jellyfish blooms.									4	1	0	0	4	0	5			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000412840700007		
J	Munk, Peter								Cross-frontal variation in growth rate and prey availability of larval North Sea cod Gadus morhua								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				334				225	235		10.3354/meps334225				2007	2007	Fish larvae are often concentrated in areas of hydrographic fronts and frontal processes are likely to affect larval growth and survival. The potential influence could be direct through impact from specific physical parameters, or it could be indirect through enhancement of prey availability in the frontal zone. The present paper examines the physical-biological linkages for cod larvae distributed across hydrographic fronts in the NE North Sea, hypothesising that larval growth rate and prey availability are promoted in the central frontal zone. Cod larvae and zooplankton were sampled along a series of cross-frontal transects in May of 1992, 1993 and 1994. Growth rate was ascertained from age-at-length, using otolith examination, while prey availability was estimated from copepod abundance and prey preference curves. Larval growth rate was significantly promoted at the front, and significant along-frontal and interannual differences were also found. Prey availability was enhanced in the frontal areas, but there was no significant relationship between availability and corresponding estimates of larval growth rate. The findings stress the need to consider environmental variability when ascertaining growth rates of larval fishes and point to the influence of hydrographic fronts in the survival and recruitment processes of fishes.									17	0	0	0	13	0	18			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000245862000021		
J	Bertram, DF; Mackas, DL; McKinnell, SM								The seasonal cycle revisited: interannual variation and ecosystem consequences								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				49	1-4	SI		283	307		10.1016/S0079-6611(01)00027-1				2001	2001	The annual seasonal cycle accounts for much of the total temporal variability of mid- and high-latitude marine ecosystems. Although the general pattern of the seasons repeats each year, climatic variability of the atmosphere and the ocean produce detectable changes in intensity and onset timing. We use a combination of time series data from oceanographic, zooplankton and seabird breeding data to ask if and how these variations in the timing of the spring growing season affect marine populations. For the physical environment, we develop an annual index of spring timing by fitting a non-linear 2-parameter periodic function to the average weekly SST data observed in British Columbia from I January to the end of August each year. For each year, the phase parameter describes the timing of seasonal warming (the timing index) and the amplitude parameter describes the magnitude of the temperature increase between the fitted winter minimum and summer maximum. For the zooplankton, which have annual and strongly synchronous cycles of biomass, productivity, and developmental sequence, we use copepodite stage composition to index the timing of the annual maximum. For seabirds, we examine (1975-1999) the timing of hatching, nestling growth performance, and diet for four species of alcids at Triangle Island, British Columbia's largest seabird colony and the world's largest population of the planktivorous Cassin's auklet. Temperature, zooplankton, and seabirds have all shown recent decadal trends toward 'earlier spring', but the magnitudes of the timing perturbations have differed from variable to variable and from year to year. Recent (1996-1999) extreme interannual variation in spring timing and April SST helped to facilitate a mechanistic investigation of oceanographic features that affect the reproductive performance of seabirds. Our results demonstrate a significant negative relationship between the annual spring timing index (and April mean SST) and nestling growth rates for both Cassin's auklet and rhinoceros auklet. Nestling growth rates were significantly lower in early, warm years. We demonstrate that low growth rates of Cassin's auklet occurred when copepod composition in nestling diet was low overall and copepods were scarce or absent in samples collected later in the season. We propose that when spring is early and warm, the duration of overlap of seabird breeding and copepod availability in surface waters becomes reduced, effectively creating a seasonal mismatch of prey and predator populations. Such a mismatch could explain the reduced reproductive performance of seabirds compared to years when spring was later and colder. The relationships we develop here can be used as simple predictive models to examine the effects of ocean climate change on seabird reproductive performance within our region.

To better understand how modest climate differences affect lizard energetics, we compared daily feeding and metabolism rates of individual Sceloporus occidentalis in two populations during mid-summer. Chuckanut Beach (CB) was a cool, maritime climate in northern Washington State, and Sondino Ranch (SR) was a warmer, drier climate in southern, inland Washington. We found no difference between populations in daily energy expenditure (DEE), as calculated from doubly labeled water estimates. The CB population, however, had significantly higher prey availability and rate of daily energy intake (DEI) as estimated from fecal pellet masses. Consequently, CB lizards had higher size adjusted body masses than lizards from SR. Within CB, during midsummer, DEE was similar to DEI. Within the SR population, DEE trended higher than DEI during midsummer, but was not significantly different. We found no population differences in lizard activity, active body temperature, or preferred body temperature. Hence, we infer the longer activity season for the SR population may compensate for the low food availability and high daily energy cost of midsummer. Moreover, for the CB population, we infer that cooler temperatures and higher food availability allow the lizards to compensate for the shorter activity. We also suggest the CB population may benefit from the predicted warmer temperatures associated with climate change given the similar activity-period body temperatures and DEE between these lizard populations assuming food availability is sufficient.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0045-8511	1938-5110		WOS:000446747700008		
J	Kepler, Megan V.; Wagner, Tyler; Sweka, John A.								Comparative Bioenergetics Modeling of Two Lake Trout Morphotypes								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				143	6			1592	1604		10.1080/00028487.2014.954051				2014	2014	Efforts to restore Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Laurentian Great Lakes have been hampered for decades by several factors, including overfishing and invasive species (e. g., parasitism by Sea Lampreys Petromyzon marinus and reproductive deficiencies associated with consumption of Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus). Restoration efforts are complicated by the presence of multiple body forms (i. e., morphotypes) of Lake Trout that differ in habitat utilization, prey consumption, lipid storage, and spawning preferences. Bioenergetics models constitute one tool that is used to help inform management and restoration decisions; however, bioenergetic differences among morphotypes have not been evaluated. The goal of this research was to investigate bioenergetic differences between two actively stocked morphotypes: lean and humper Lake Trout. We measured consumption and respiration rates across a wide range of temperatures (4-22 degrees C) and size-classes (5-100 g) to develop bioenergetics models for juvenile Lake Trout. Bayesian estimation was used so that uncertainty could be propagated through final growth predictions. Differences between morphotypes were minimal, but when present, the differences were temperature and weight dependent. Basal respiration did not differ between morphotypes at any temperature or size-class. When growth and consumption differed between morphotypes, the differences were not consistent across the size ranges tested. Management scenarios utilizing the temperatures presently found in the Great Lakes (e. g., predicted growth at an average temperature of 11.7 degrees C and 14.4 degrees C during a 30-d period) demonstrated no difference in growth between the two morphotypes. Due to a lack of consistent differences between lean and humper Lake Trout, we developed a model that combined data from both morphotypes. The combined model yielded results similar to those of the morphotype-specific models, suggesting that accounting for morphotype differences may not be necessary in bioenergetics modeling of lean and humper Lake Trout.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000345706800018

No direct mortality from catch- and-release angling was recorded, even though water temperatures were as high as 27-30 degreesC during capture. Indirect catch-and-release mortality could be increased risk of being predated upon before recovering from capture and release, as the transmitter from one threespot tilapia was found under a typical African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) tree, indicating that it was captured by a fish eagle. Excessive movements the first days after release compared to later in the season could indicate a behavioural reaction to capture and release. It is concluded that catch-and-release angling may be a successful management strategy to sustain recreational fisheries of cichlids in declining populations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Reproductive parameters were estimated for individual newly emerged thrips, which had spent their immature stages at different temperatures. The highest rate of gross fecundity was at 30 degrees C (113.7 eggs/female), whereas the lowest value of this parameter was at 15 degrees C (25.1 eggs/female). The gross fertility rate was highest at 30 degrees C (98.9 eggs/female) and lowest at 37 degrees C (14.6 eggs/female). The net fecundity rate varied from 80.2 eggs/female (at 30 degrees C) to 10.04 eggs/female (at 37 degrees C). The net fertility rate was highest at 30 degrees C (69.7 eggs/female) and lowest at 37 degrees C (5.2 eggs/female). The daily number of eggs laid per female ranged from 0.8 to 3.93 eggs, with a minimum at 15 degrees C and a maximum at 35 degrees C. Our results demonstrated that 30 degrees C was the optimum temperature for reproductive of the studied population of S. longicornis.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0164-7954			WOS:000309123900004

However, joint effects of predation risk and additional environmental factors on species interaction strengths in multitrophic systems remain largely unexplored, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the links between local environmental characteristics and food web properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the effects of habitat complexity and predation risk by top predatory dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea) on feeding rates and energetic efficiency (i.e. the ratio of acquired and expended energy) of the larvae of three intermediate predatory odonate species (Libellula quadrimaculata, Sympetrum sanguineum, and Ischnura elegans) preying on cladocerans. We hypothesised that predation risk would decrease the feeding rate, especially in the structurally simple habitat, and increase the metabolic rate of all intermediate predators. We also expected higher feeding rates of intermediate predators using aquatic vegetation as a perching site (i.e. Sympetrum and Ischnura) in the structurally complex habitat. Finally, we expected to observe habitat- and predation risk-dependent energetic efficiencies of the intermediate predators driven by changes in feeding and metabolic rates. The effect of predation risk on feeding rates was species specific and differed between the structurally simple and complex habitat. Habitat complexity increased feeding rates but only in the absence of predation risk. Moreover, predation risk signalled by chemical cues significantly increased Sympetrum vulgatum feeding rates but did not influence the feeding rates of the two other intermediate predators. Metabolic rates varied among the three intermediate predators but were not affected by predation risk. Estimated energetic efficiency decreased with intermediate predator body mass and depended, to a lesser extent, on the interactive effect of habitat complexity and predation risk. Our results imply that the effects of habitat complexity and predation risk on trophic interactions are likely to be determined by traits related to foraging and defence of the intermediate predators and their habitat domains, and that energetic efficiency is mainly determined by predator mass. Given that habitat complexity and predation risk can vary substantially across habitats, we conclude that it is important to consider habitat complexity and predation risk to better understand and predict the effects of environmentally driven variations on trophic interaction strength and metabolic rates that underlie the energetic efficiency of individual consumers. This has important implications for population and community dynamics as well as ecosystem functioning.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000474661800010

ENERGY INTAKE RATE INFLUENCES SURVIVAL OF BLACK OYSTERCATCHER HAEMATOPUS BACHMANI BROODS								MARINE ORNITHOLOGY				47	2			277	283						OCT 2019	2019	The Black Oystercatcher Haematopus bachmani is a species of conservation concern that depends on marine intertidal prey resources. We examined diet, feeding rates, growth, and survival of Black Oystercatcher broods in southcentral Alaska, 2013-2014. To determine the importance of diet for brood survival, we modeled daily survival rates of broods as a function of energy intake rate and other ecological factors. We hypothesized that broods fed at higher energy intake rates would grow faster and fly earlier, and thus be less vulnerable to predators and have higher rates of survival. Consistent with our prediction, broods with higher energy intake rates bad higher rates of growth and daily survival. Our best-supported model indicated that brood survival varied by energy intake rate and brood age. To understand how adults meet the increasing nutritional needs of developing chicks, we examined delivery rates, prey type, and prey size as a function of brood age. Delivery rates differed by age, but composition and size classes of prey items did not, indicating that adults respond to the rising energetic needs of broods by increasing parental effort rather than by switching prey. These findings demonstrate the importance of diet and provisioning to broods and, given the consequences of reduced energy intake on survival, indicate that climate change-related shifts in intertidal invertebrates could significantly impact Black Oystercatcher populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1018-3337	2074-1235		WOS:000489572600020

The Biotest is a man-made enclosure within the Baltic Sea that has received warm water from a nuclear power plant since 1980, resulting in temperatures that are elevated 5-10 degrees C relative to the surrounding Baltic Sea. Sampled fish ranged from young-of-the-year to 14years. Geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistical analysis revealed significant morphological differences between individuals of P. fluviatilis from these two habitats. Most importantly, relative shape changed with size, with small individuals of P. fluviatilis from Biotest being characterized by a deeper body shape and a larger caudal peduncle than the smaller Baltic individuals. In large specimens, smaller differences were found with Biotest individuals being more slender than Baltic individuals. These results show that, in order to have a full understanding of the biological effects of elevated temperatures, studies that cover the entire size range of organisms will be important. Apart from the direct influence of temperature on growth rate and body shape, other ecological factors affected by temperature are discussed as possible contributors to the observed differences between the two populations.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000363590400008	26440307

Distribution and diet of larval and juvenile Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in the shallow Canadian Beaufort Sea								JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS				84	3-4			78	84		10.1016/j.jmarsys.2010.09.001				FEB 2011	2011	The distribution and diet of larval and juvenile Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) were studied during summer 2005 in the coastal Canadian Beaufort Sea. A total of 275 individuals were captured and the highest abundance was observed at station depths of 20-30 m. This corresponds well with the location of the frontal zone where the Mackenzie River plume water and open sea water meet. Diet examinations were performed on 220 Arctic cod, which were found undamaged from sampling. We observed a gradual decrease in prey number per fish and increase in prey size as larvae grew which corresponded to a shift from Rotifera and nauplii towards larger copepodid stages. However, at all sizes, the larvae remain generalists and feed on a broad range of organisms. Environmental changes due to climate warming could have a two-fold impact on fish larvae feeding in the studied region. First, the potential for increased primary production may lead to increased zooplankton production that may impact the feeding and nutrition positively. On the other hand, greater discharge of turbid water from the Mackenzie River may reduce light penetration in the water column that may negatively influence the ability of visual predators to successively forage.

Here we tested the effects of elevated CO2 on the predatory behaviours of two ecologically distinct cephalopod species, the pygmy squid, Idiosepius pygmaeus, and the bigfin reef squid, Sepioteuthis lessoniana. Both species exhibited an increased latency to attack and altered body pattern choice during the attack sequence at elevated CO2. I. pygmaeus also exhibited a 20% decrease in predation rate, an increased striking distance, and reduced preference for attacking the posterior end of prey at elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 increased activity levels of S. lessoniana comparable to those previously shown in I. pygmaeus, which could adversely affect their energy budget and increase their potential to be preyed upon. The effects of elevated CO2 on predatory behaviours, predation strategies and activity levels of cephalopods reported here could have farreaching consequences in marine ecosystems due to the ecological importance of cephalopods in the marine food web.									13	1	0	0	13	0	13			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000433717700029	29460508

The larvae, hatched from berried females from S. Euboikos Bay (Aegean Sea, Greece), were reared at 10 temperature-food density combinations (19 and 24 degrees C; 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 Artemia nauplii d(-1)). Enhanced starvation resistance was evident: 92 and 58% of starved zoeas I molted to zoea II, while metamorphosis to megalopa was achieved by 76 and 42% of the hatched zoeas at 19 and 24 degrees C, respectively. The duration of both zoeal stages was affected by temperature, food density and their interaction. Nevertheless, starvation showed different effects at the two temperatures: compared to the fed shrimp, the starved zoeae exhibited accelerated development at 19 degrees C (8.4 d) but delayed metamorphosis at 24 degrees C (5.9 d). On the other hand, both zoeal stages were able to consume food at an increased rate as food density and temperature increased. Predation efficiency also increased with temperature, but never exceeded 0.6. Facultative lecithotrophy, more pronounced during the first zoeal stage of C. tyrrhena, can be regarded as an adaptation of a species whose larvae can respond physiologically to the different temperature-food density combinations encountered in the wide geographical range of their natural habitat.									19	0	0	0	21	5	22			0025-3162			WOS:000080539500006

Corallivores often prey on corals repeatedly, and this predation induces wounds that require extensive cellular resources to heal. The effects of corallivory on coral growth, reproduction, and community dynamics are well-documented, and often result in reduced growth rates and fitness. Given the degree of anthropogenic pressures that threaten coral reefs, it is now imperative to focus on understanding how corallivory interacts with anthropogenic forces to alter coral health and community dynamics. For example, coral bleaching events that stem from global climate change often reduce preferred corals species for many corallivorous fishes. These reductions in preferred prey may result in declines in populations of more specialized corallivores while more generalist corallivores may increase. Corallivory may also make corals more susceptible to thermal stress and exacerbate bleaching. At local scales, overfishing depletes corallivorous fish stocks, reducing fish corallivory and bioerosion, whilst removing invertivorous fishes and allowing population increases in invertebrate corallivores (e.g., urchins, Drupella spp.). Interactive effects of local stressors, such as overfishing and nutrient pollution, can alter the effect of corallivory by increasing coral-algal competition and destabilizing the coral microbiome, subsequently leading to coral disease and mortality. Here, we synthesize recent literature of how global climate change and local stressors affect corallivore populations and shape the patterns and effect of corallivory. Our review indicates that the combined effects of corallivory and anthropogenic pressures may be underappreciated and that these interactions often drive changes in coral reefs on scales from ecosystems to microbes. Understanding the ecology of coral reefs in the Anthropocene will require an increased focus on how anthropogenic forcing alters biotic interactions, such as corallivory, and the resulting cascading effects on corals and reef ecosystems.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12				2296-7745		WOS:000464906300001

However, changes in climate, land-use and trophic structure of ecosystems increasingly jeopardise the persistence of such diverse assemblages. Body size has been used successfully to explain ungulate niche differentiation with regard to food requirements and predation sensitivity. But this single trait axis insufficiently captures interspecific differences in water requirements and thermoregulatory capacity and thus sensitivity to climate change. Here, we develop a two-dimensional trait space of body size and minimum dung moisture content that characterises the combined food and water requirements of large herbivores. From this, we predict that increased spatial homogeneity in water availability in drylands reduces the number of ungulate species that will coexist. But we also predict that extreme droughts will cause the larger, water-dependent grazers as wildebeest, zebra and buffalo-dominant species in savanna ecosystems - to be replaced by smaller, less water-dependent species. Subsequently, we explore how other constraints such as predation risk and thermoregulation are connected to this two-dimensional framework. Our novel framework integrates multiple simultaneous stressors for herbivores and yields an extensive set of testable hypotheses about the expected changes in large herbivore community composition following climate change.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000477113200001	31332945

To evaluate predatory impacts of sand shrimp, daily energy requirements (J ind.(-1) day(-1)) were calculated for this species from laboratory estimates of energy losses due to routine (R-R), active (R-A), and feeding (R-SDA) oxygen consumption rates (J ind.(-1) h(-1)), coupled with measurements of diel motile activity. Shrimp used in this study were collected biweekly from the Niantic River, Connecticut (41degrees33'N; 72degrees19'W) during late spring and summer of 2000 and 2001. The rates of shrimp energy loss due to R-R and R-A increased exponentially with increasing temperature, with the magnitude of increase greater between 6degreesC and 10degreesC (Q(10)=3.01) than between 10degreesC and 14degreesC (Q(10)=2.85). Rates of R-R doubled with a twofold increase in shrimp mass, and R-SDA was 0.130 J h(-1)+R-R, irrespective of shrimp body size. Shrimp motile activity was significantly greater during dark periods relative to light periods, indicating nocturnal behavior. Nocturnal activity also increased significantly at higher temperatures, and at 20degreesC shifted from a unimodal to a bimodal pattern. Laboratory estimates of daily metabolic expenditures (1.7-307.4 J ind.(-1) day(-1) for 0.05 and 1.5 g wet weight shrimp, respectively, between 0degreesC and 20degreesC) were combined with results from previous investigations to construct a bioenergetic model and make inferences regarding the trophic positioning of C. septemspinosa. Bioenergetic model estimates indicated that juvenile and adult shrimp could meet daily energy demands via opportunistic omnivory, selectively preying upon items of high energy content (e.g. invertebrate and fish tissue) and compensating for limited prey availability by ingesting readily accessible lower energy food (e.g. detritus and plant material).									21	0	0	0	22	0	22			0025-3162			WOS:000222369500017

Model scenarios incorporated observed decadal changes in larval diel vertical distribution and climate-driven abiotic and biotic environmental factors including variability in the abundance of different, key prey species (calanoid copepods) as well as seasonal changes, long-term trends, and spatial differences in water temperature. Climate forcing affected Baltic sprat larval survival both directly (via changes in temperature) and indirectly (via changes in prey populations). By incorporating observed changes in larval diel vertical migration, decadal changes in modeled and observed survival of Baltic sprat agreed well. Higher larval survival (spawning stock biomass) was predicted in the 1990s compared to the 1980s. After changing their foraging strategy by shifting from mid-depth, low prey environment to near-surface waters, first-feeding larvae encountered much higher rates of prey encounter and almost optimal feeding conditions and had a much higher growth potential. Consequently, larvae were predicted to experience optimal conditions to ensure higher survival throughout the later larval and early juvenile stages. However, this behavioral shift also increased the susceptibility of larvae to unfavorable wind-driven surface currents, contributing to the marked increase in interannual variability in recruitment observed during the past decade.									14	0	0	0	7	0	14			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000283657000003

Arcto-Norwegian cod (AN, 17-48 mm standard length, SL, 34-90 d post-hatch), were sampled in July 1988 with a capelin pelagic trawl, while south-west Nova cod (NAFO region 4X, 7-32 mm SL and 32-105 d post-hatch) were sampled in May-June 1985-1986 with a Tucker trawl. Growth over the previous 14 d, back-calculated from otolith daily growth increments was 0.71 mm d(-1) and 0.33 mm d(-1) for AN and 4X cod respectively. Within and between stocks, water temperature and zooplankton biomass were significantly correlated with the 14 d index (linear model, r(2)=0.42), but an ANCOVA model comparing the AN and 4X regions was highly significant (r(2)=0.71), indicating additional factors. Gear selection was not found to be responsible. While genetic factors could produce this result, there is 48% more time during May-July for visual feeding north of the 71 degrees N latitude off Norway compared with 43 degrees N off eastern Canada, using the light intensity threshold for larval cod feeding. Our hypothesis of light-limited feeding opportunity is consistent with a size- and temperature-dependent consumption model, and with aquaculture methods, as well as the necessity for fast growth in the short northern summer for over-winter survival.

The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) hypothesizes the temperature-invariance of secondary production, driven by matched and opposed forces that reduce biomass of heterotrophs while increasing their biomass turnover rate (production : biomass, or P:B) with warming. To test this prediction at the whole community level, we used a geothermal heat exchanger to experimentally warm a stream in southwest Iceland by 3.8 degrees C for two years. We quantified invertebrate community biomass, production, and P:B in the experimental stream and a reference stream for one year prior to warming and two years during warming. As predicted, warming had a neutral effect on community production, but this result was not driven by opposing effects on community biomass and P:B. Instead, warming had a positive effect on both the biomass and production of larger-bodied, slower-growing taxa (e.g., larval black flies, dipteran predators, snails) and a negative effect on small-bodied taxa with relatively high growth rates (e.g., ostracods, larval chironomids). We attribute these divergent responses to differences in thermal preference between small-vs. large-bodied taxa. Although metabolic demand vs. resource supply must ultimately constrain community production, our results highlight the potential for idiosyncratic community responses to warming, driven by variation in thermal preference and body size within regional species pools.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000404875100007	28402586

However, efficiency in food capture is strongly dependent on current velocity. Moreover, seawater temperature may also affect feeding success, since polyp contraction or nematocyst function could be slower at temperatures below the natural thermal range of a species. The non-reef forming CWC Dendrophyllia cornigera occurs in areas at temperatures from 11 to 17 degrees C, but is apparently absent from most CWC reefs at temperatures constantly below 11 degrees C. This study thus aimed to assess if a reduction in feeding capacity may contribute to understand the absence of this CWC from strictly cold environments. The efficiency of D. cornigera to capture meso- and macrozooplankton was assessed under different flow speeds (2,5 and 10 cm s(-1)) and temperatures (8, 12, and 16 degrees C). Flow speeds did not significantly affect the capture of mesozooplankton, whereas capture of macrozooplankton was significantly enhanced with increasing flow speed. Both meso- and macrozooplankton captures were not significantly affected by temperature in D. comigera. Overall, this CWC species is efficient in capturing zooplanIcton under a larger range of flow velocities than the widespread CWC Lophelia pertusa, whose capture efficiency significantly decreased from low to high flow speeds. Even if temperature does not directly affect the capture rates of D. comigera, it may still influence the feeding capacity of this CWC since the capture rates at 8 degrees C were always in the lowest range of the observed values at each flow speed, and corals maintained at 8 degrees C required a much longer time to fully expand their polyps once they were placed in the incubation chambers, than corals maintained at 12 and 16 degrees C.

J	Halfyard, Edmund A.; Webber, D.; Del Papa, J.; Leadley, T.; Kessel, S. T.; Colborne, S. F.; Fisk, A. T.								Evaluation of an acoustic telemetry transmitter designed to identify predation events								METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				8	9			1063	1071		10.1111/2041-210X.12726				SEP 2017	2017	1. The field of acoustic telemetry has evolved rapidly and now permits the remote sensing of animal behaviour, movement, physiology and survival in environments, and species not previously possible. However, an inability to detect when a telemetered animal is consumed by a predator can complicate accurate interpretation of the telemetry data. In this paper, we describe the efforts taken to test the two generations of a novel prototype acoustic telemetry transmitter designed specifically to detect predation.2. Testing involved either staged predation events where tagged prey (Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens) were fed to captive Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, or false-positive testing where prey fish were tagged and held without the risk of predation. Metrics of interest were (i) the rate of correctly identifying the predation events, (ii) signal lag (i.e. the time required to detect a predation event), (iii) tag retention time in the predator's gut, and (iv) the rate of false-positive triggering in both live and dead prey fishes.3. Staged predation events were successfully identified in 61/65 and 52/55 trials for generation 1 and 2 tags, respectively. Signal lag time was reduced in generation 1 tags (generally between 1 and 9 h) relative to generation 2 (3-29 h); although signal lag was highly variable. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) indicated strong evidence that signal lag and tag retention were both negatively correlated with water temperature, but were not affected by prey species and only slightly by individual predator traits. There was preliminary evidence that prey size may be an important determinant of both signal lag and tag retention. False-positives in live fish were absent after 120 days for generation 1 tags (n = 31), however, the false-positive rates were significantly higher (10/44) after only 66 days for generation 2 tags. False-positives in dead fish showed that 20% of the generation 2 predation tags would falsely trigger 2-3 days post-mortem.4. Testing of the novel predation tags was encouraging, however, further testing is recommended. Predation tags will be an important contribution to the field of acoustic telemetry, thus, permitting the improved data interpretation and less-subjective estimates of predation rates in biotelemetry studies.									26	0	0	0	23	0	26			2041-210X	2041-2096		WOS:000409994400004

Seven fish species of different energy density, smelt, herring, sprat, sandeel, goby, whiting, and Norway pout, and one crustacean, brown shrimp were tested as prey. A general evacuation model, including predator weight, temperature, and meal size as variables, was fitted to the data on wet weights by means of non-linear regression technique. Additionally the extensive stomach evacuation data on Barents Sea cod from the literature were reanalysed to test for differences in gastric evacuation between stocks from different ecosystems. It, vas shown that the exclusion of meal size as an explanatory variable caused only minor reductions in the explained variance (0-3.2%) with only one exception (capelin) where the explained variance was reduced by 6.1%. When meal size was excluded from the model, the estimates for the curvature parameter were generally close to 0.5 and since the model can be applied in this form only to estimate field consumption rates meal size was excluded in further analyses. The parameters for curvature, predator weight, and temperature effect were similar for the different prey types and both data sets. The mean curvature parameter was estimated at 0.534 and not significantly different from 0.5. This confirmed the work performed with other gadoid predators. The exponent of the predator weight effect was estimated as 0.306, and the exponent for the temperature effect as 0.110 which corresponds to a Q(10) = 3.0. The estimates for the prey-specific parameter ranged from 0.00424 (C. crangon) to 0.0141 (polychaetes). In case of fish prey a large part of the variation in these prey-specific evacuation parameters could be explained by differences in energy density of the prey. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In particular, acroporid and pocilloporid populations were dramatically reduced, while poritid and faviid corals were less impacted and now dominate coral assemblages. Subsequent to this perturbation, there have been changes in the abundance and distribution of the coral eating crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster cf. solaris (to densities of up to 320ha(-1)) that have had a further impact on coral communities selectively targeting the coral taxa most susceptible to bleaching, often referred to as climate change losers. The feeding selectivity of A. cf. solaris under post-bleaching conditions was studied to determine its likely impact on coral communities and coral recovery. We found that even when Acropora and Pocillopora were extremely rare, A. cf. solaris demonstrated a high level of selectivity for these genera, although they consumed non-preferred taxa such as poritid, faviid, and merulinid corals in greater numbers. The consumption of non-preferred genera and families of corals differed between sites and was influenced by their local abundance. This study demonstrates that where crown-of-thorns starfish populations greatly exceed outbreak threshold densities of 10-15ha(-1), they are likely to impact recovery of coral communities from bleaching events and exacerbate bleaching induced changes in assemblage structure.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000467561000002

Here, we used a 35-day experiment to evaluate how ocean warming and acidification may impact the nutritional qualities and physiological health of Dicathais orbita, a predatory muricid whelk common on the east coast of Australia, and discuss the broader ecological implications. Using an orthogonal experimental design with four treatments (current conditions [similar to 23 degrees C and similar to 380 ppm of pCO(2)], ocean warming treatment [similar to 25 and similar to 380 ppm of pCO(2)], ocean acidification treatment [CO2 similar to 23 degrees C and similar to 750 ppm of pCO(2)], and ocean warming and acidification treatment [CO2, similar to 25 C and similar to 750 ppm of pCO(2)]), we showed that changes in moisture and protein content were driven by significant interactions between ocean warming and acidification. Elevated ocean temperature significantly decreased protein in the whelk flesh and resulted in concurrent increases in moisture. Lipid, glycogen, potassium, sulfur, and phosphorus content also decreased under elevated temperature conditions, whereas sodium, boron and copper increased. Furthermore, elevated pCO(2) significantly decreased lipid, protein and lead content. Whelks from control conditions had levels of lead in excess of that considered safe for human consumption, although lead uptake appears to be lowered under future ocean conditions and will be site specific. In conclusion, while D. orbita has received research attention as a potential food product with nutritious value, ocean climate change may compromise its nutritional qualities and reduce sustainable harvests in the future. Furthermore, ocean climate change may have deleterious impacts on the longevity and reproductive potential of this important rocky shore predator. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The coral reefs across the international border between Kenya and Tanzania, Where historical differences in government policy and socio-economic conditions created two different management systems, were examined: a large permanent closed area and a collaborative fisheries management project that used gear management and small voluntarily and temporary closed areas, respectively. The diversity and ecology of the reefs in these two management systems were compared spanning a seven-year period to evaluate the effectiveness of the management and to assess the ecological response to a large-scale water-temperature anomaly in 1998.2. Comparisons of rates of predation on sea urchins and of herbivory, using a seagrass assay, were made along with measures of benthic cover and fish abundance and diversity.3. The collaborative fisheries management system was successful in increasing fish stocks, reducing erect algae, and maintaining ecological diversity and stability across the thermal anomaly. This management system, however, was not successful in protecting the expected full biodiversity of fish, predation rates on sea urchins, or the sensitive, branching coral species. Management of the fishery also increased fish stocks in the adjacent, large, permanently closed area, compared to Kenyan parks Without this management.4. The large, permanently closed area in the other system maintained high diversity, high predation rates on sea urchins and high herbivory rates, which maintained erect algae abundance and diversity at low levels. The temperature anomaly was destructive to a number of the dominant delicate branching coral species, but overall coral cover and diversity were maintained, although dominance switched from branching Porites spp. to Seriatopora spp. over this period. The large closed area system protected the undisturbed ecology of these reefs and associated ecological processes, and the full diversity of fish and coral, including sensitive species such as branching corals and slow-growing fish.5. Collaborative fisheries and large permanent closed area management have different attributes that, when combined, should achieve the Multiple purposes of sustainable fisheries, ecosystem functions and protection of fishing-sensitive species.

Waldo								USING IN SITU VIDEO ANALYSIS TO ASSESS JUVENILE FLATFISH BEHAVIOR ALONG THE OREGON CENTRAL COAST								CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS				55				158	168						DEC 2014	2014	We examined the feasibility of using a video beam trawl system to assess behavioral responses of juvenile flatfishes in relation to co-occurring habitat features, most notably dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Sixteen samples were collected along a cross shelf transect in the central Oregon coast during summer 2008. We found that juvenile fish reaction duration, defined as the time in seconds from first reaction to capture, decreased with decreased DO. However, other variables such as bottom water temperature, fish size, and fish species composition by site are potentially confounding factors of the analysis. The dominant flatfish species shifted from English sole (Parophyrs vetulus) to Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus) with increased depth. Escape behavior varied from "burying" in the shallows, to "hovering" at mid-depth stations, and "running" at the deepest site. Collectively, our results suggest that the video beam trawl effectively monitor behavioral metrics and community composition of nearshore flatfish assemblages.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0575-3317			WOS:000346192400011

As part of a study of the effect of Piona exigua on its prey populations we measured the effects of water temperature and prey density on the lifespan, age at first reproduction and per capita egg production of adult female mites. Mites were raised in the laboratory at five prey (Ceriodaphnia, Daphnia) densities (5, 15, 30, 60, 120/1) at 15-degrees-C and at four temperatures (10, 15, 18, 22-degrees-C) at c. 60 prey/1. In response to increased food level, mites increased the number of eggs laid to reach a maximum at 60 prey/1, the rate at which they were laid increased and the pre-reproductive period was shorter. Low temperatures prolonged the pre-reproductive period. At temperatures above 10-degrees-C, food level and temperature had more influence on the timing of reproductive events (growth rate, oviposition rate, age at first reproduction) than on size of females at first reproduction. When temperatures exceed 10-degrees-C and food levels exceed 5 prey/1 the major scope for reproductive plasticity in Piona lies in the timing and duration of egg production.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0029-8549			WOS:A1991GM33100011	28312135

Although a bark beetle outbreak was 1st noted at our study site in 1994, significant feeding on them by red squirrels was not observed until 2002, after which there was significant increase in the prevalence of autumn beetle foraging by squirrels into 2003. This increase corresponded with a decrease in spruce seed availability, the squirrels' preferred food source. Spruce bark beetles currently represent an important food source, with 73% of monitored squirrels engaged in beetle feeding in autumn 2003, providing 20% of daily energy requirements. In autumn 2002 and 2003, the density of beetle-infested trees on a squirrel's territory was a significant predictor of whether it fed on beetle larvae but not the proportion of its foraging bouts involving bark beetles. Feeding on larval spruce bark beetles by red squirrels represents a short-term solution to a climate-mediated beetle outbreak that will ultimately reduce local spruce seed production and habitat suitability for red squirrels.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0022-2372			WOS:000241569500011		
J	Hughes, NF				Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009				A model of habitat selection by drift-feeding stream salmonids at different scales								ECOLOGY				79	1			281	294		10.2307/176882				JAN 1998	1998	Whole-stream size gradients of drift-feeding stream salmonids have received practically no attention, perhaps because the smaller-fish-upstream pattern that is thought to prevail is consistent with knowledge of habitat selection by other stream fish at the local scale. However, a rather counterintuitive larger-fish-upstream pattern has recently been documented for Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in Alaska and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in New Zealand, and habitat selection theory cannot explain these observations. My goal in this paper is to improve this situation by developing a model that predicts the distribution of a population of fish both within single pools and over the length of the entire river, as well as the behavioral mechanism responsible. The model uses information on invertebrate drift density and water temperature to predict the growth rate of different sizes of fish at the positions available in the stream. Fish then distribute themselves so that each individual occupies the most profitable position it call defend, with the largest fish winning any disputes. The model suggests that streams can be classified into categories based on the way temperature and drift density vary with the passage downstream. Each of these categories favors a different combination of size gradient and behavioral mechanism. A larger-fish-upstream pattern due to size-dependent habitat preference is predicted for streams with cool temperatures and low drift densities, conditions found in Arctic grayling streams. A larger-fish-upstream pattern due to competition between fish of different size is predicted in warm streams, irrespective of drift density, conditions found in many New Zealand trout streams. A smaller-fish-upstream pattern due to competition between fish of different size is expected in cool streams with high drift abundance; currently no data are available to test this prediction.									88	0	0	0	86	0	92			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000071525500025

Influence of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic Ocean on a parasite, Echinorhynchus gadi (Acanthocephala) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occurring off coastal Labrador, Canada								JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY				82	3			203	209		10.1017/S0022149X0897615X				SEP 2008	2008	A study was conducted to determine the influence of environmental change on an endoparasite, Echinorhynchus gadi (Acanthocephala) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) over a 30-year period off the coast of Labrador in the north-western Atlantic, North Atlantic Fisheries Organization subareas 2J-3K. Cod, once all abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20 degrees C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic.									6	1	0	0	6	0	7			0022-149X	1475-2697		WOS:000258659600003	18452629

Influence of Abiotic Factors on Activity in a Larval Stream Salamander Assemblage								SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST				10	1			109	120		10.1656/058.010.0109				MAR 2011	2011	Larval stream salamanders are the numerically dominant predators in many headwater stream systems. Nonetheless, little is known about their activity patterns or the extent to which their movements are influenced by prevailing environmental conditions. In this study, we used capture rates from passive trapping as an index of activity level and sought to identify the environmental variables most responsible for fluctuations in larval stream salamander activity. Over the course of two months, we captured stream salamanders in aquatic funnel traps during both day- and night-trapping sessions at a first-order stream in the North Carolina Piedmont. Using an information-theoretic approach, we constructed models to elucidate the effects of (1) water temperature, (2) cloud cover, (3) days since last rainfall, and (4) time of day on larval salamander activity. We found that the model incorporating time of day and cloud cover was the best predictor of larval salamander activity. In our study, larval salamander activity was highest at night and also demonstrated a weak positive correlation with increasing cloud cover. Using model-averaging, we further determined that our time of day and cloud cover variables demonstrated a significant correlation with observed activity levels. This pattern of peak activity under low light conditions could be a behavioral adaptation that limits predation risk for larval salamanders.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1528-7092			WOS:000306600900009

Although the majority of angled bonefish are released following capture, little is known about their behavior or post-release survival. Using ultrasonic transmitters and small visual floats, we assessed behavior and mortality of bonefish following catch-and-release angling at spring water temperatures (25.5-27.3 degreesC) in two regions of the Bahamas with differing shark abundances. All observed mortality occurred within 30 min of release and was a direct result of predation by sharks. In the low shark abundance areas, all released bonefish survived, whereas in the high shark abundance areas, some mortality (39%) was observed. Exhaustively angled fish exposed to air had problems maintaining equilibrium following release. These fish typically spent substantial periods of the first 30 min post-release remaining stationary, then moved in rapid bursts. The results of this study, highlight the benefits of angling and releasing bonefish quickly, minimizing handling and particularly air exposure. Furthermore, when shark predation threat is high, anglers should avoid releasing bonefish in the immediate area. The conservation of exploited recreational bonefish fisheries will depend upon the development and dissemination of science-based catch-and-release strategies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Modelling spatially dependent predation mortality of eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock, and its implications for stock dynamics under future climate scenarios								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				73	5			1330	1342		10.1093/icesjms/fsw040				MAY-JUN 2016	2016	Arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) are an important predator of juvenile walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogramus) in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf and have increased 3-fold in biomass from 1977 to 2014. Arrowtooth flounder avoid the summer "cold pool" (bottom water <= 2 degrees C) and variability in cold pool size and location has affected their spatial overlap with juvenile walleye pollock. Developing a method to account for the relationship between climate change and pollock mortality can highlight ecosystem dynamics and contribute to better assessments for fisheries management. Consequently, spatially resolved predation mortality rateswere estimated within an age-structured wall eye pollock stock assessment population model (based on spatial information on diet and abundance from trawl surveys), along with the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on pollock recruitment. Projections of SST and cold pool area to 2050 were obtained (or statistically downscaled) from nine global climate models and used within an age-structure population model to project pollock abundance given estimated relationships between environmental variables and predator and prey spatial distributions, pollock recruitment, and maximum rate of arrowtooth flounder consumption. The climate projections show a wide range of variability but an overall trend of increasing SST and decreasing cold pool area. Projected pollock biomass decreased largely due to the negative effect of increased SST on pollock recruitment. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the decline in projected pollock biomass would be exacerbated if arrowtooth flounder increased their relative distribution in the EBS northwest middle shelf (an area of relatively high density of juvenile pollock) in warm years.					3rd International Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change on the World's Oceans3rd International Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change on the World's Oceans	MAR, 2015MAR, 2015	ICES; IOC; IO USPICES; IOC; IO USP	PICES, Santos, BRAZILPICES, Santos, BRAZIL	19	0	0	0	18	0	20			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000378640100007

Hiidenvesi, the spring biomass maximum of cladoceran zooplankton is missing and the highest biomass takes place in July-August. The factors behind the delayed biomass peak were studied in four different basins of the lake with concomitant data on cladocerans assemblages, density of the predatory cladoceran Leptodora kindti and food composition of fish. In all the basins, the abundance of Leptodora peaked in June, being highest (up to 800 ind. m(-3)) in the two most shallow basins (max depth < 4 m). The duration of the high population density was short and in July-August Leptodora density stayed below 200 ind. m(-3)., although the water temperature was still favourable. The collapse of the Leptodora population coincided with the change in the feeding habits of fish. In early summer, fish predation was targeted mainly on copepods and zoobenthos, while in high summer Leptodora was one of the main preys of perch, white bream and bleak. The biomass of herbivorous cladocerans was below 10 mug C 1(-1) in June, and climbed to a maximum in August in the two most shallow basins (34 and 76 mug C 1(-1)), in July in the deepest basin (27 mug C 1(-1)), and in September in the intermediate basin (55 mug C 1(-1)). In the two most shallow basins, the death rate of the dominating cladoceran, Daphnia cristata, closely followed the food consumption rate by the Leptodora population. In the deeper basins, the agreement was not so close, smelts (Osmerus eperlanus) and chaoborids being important predators of herbivores. The duration of the period of high Leptodora density thus depended on the predation pressure by fish, while the increased fish predation on Leptodora in July-August allowed the elevation of the biomass of herbivorous cladocerans.									30	0	0	0	32	0	35			1434-2944	1522-2632		WOS:000181284900003

However, harvest levels that are deemed sustainable for one species may still lead to unexpected impacts elsewhere in the ecosystem. For example, by imposing an additional source of mortality, even sustainable harvesting can lead to a reduction in the number of large individuals within a population, and this truncation in size structure is typically more severe when the largest, most valuable size classes are targeted. Often small and large individuals within a species differ in important ways, including in what they consume, so a loss in predator-prey interactions could occur even without changes in overall predator biomass. Here we explore whether a truncation in predator size structure alone can reduce or functionally eliminate linkages between predator and prey. For this outcome to occur, a predator's diet must change as it grows in size. We examined evidence for changes in diets with size among predators in three large marine ecosystems, and used a size-structured population dynamics model to evaluate the extent to which otherwise sustainable fishing results in disproportionate reductions in predation. Modelling suggests that diet shifts occurring late in life history (diet mid-point > 45% of the maximum size) led to losses in predation that were more severe than would have been expected from losses in predator biomass. Further, the form of the fishery selectivity was less important than the degree of reduction in biomass within each size class relative to the timing of diet shifts. Empirical diet information demonstrates that piscivores vary widely in their onset to piscivory, and this may buffer the potential impacts of truncation in size structure. However, over half of the piscivores had diet shifts toward specific fish taxa at sizes at or above that which would lead to disproportionate reductions in prey consumption. Information about when and how diets change with predator size could identify ecosystems where harvest may lead to unexpected losses in predator-prey interactions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0165-7836	1872-6763		WOS:000433651100002

Post-yearling (1+) steelhead fed primarily on hydropsychid larvae, chironomid pupae, zooplankton (primarily daphniids), and baetid subimago and nymphs. Although steelhead supplemented their diets with small terrestrial mammals, crayfish, and several species of fish (greater than or equal to20 mm TL), the estimated mean prey item size ingested was less than 5 mm. Mean prey size did not change relative to fish lifestage or fork length in either year. However average number of prey items per stomach increased with fork length of fish. Steelhead occasionally ingested benthic organisms dislodged from feeding and spawning activities of other salmonids. Small mats of filamentous algae were also consumed throughout the year, presumably for the zooplankton and early instar insects entrained in the material. Overall, the index of fullness for steelhead was less during the 1999 season than in 1998. This decrease may be attributed to cooler water temperatures. Steelhead grew 0.32 mm/day on average (min: 0.04; max: 0.92). Sub-adult steelhead were more mobile than adult fish and were recaptured up to 2.5 km from original tagging sites.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			0008-1078			WOS:000184062000001

Although many populations of Burbot Lota lota are declining in the species' native range, a nonnative population recently expanded into Flaming Gorge Reservoir (FGR), Wyoming-Utah, and threatens to disrupt predator-prey interactions within this popular sport fishery. To determine potential impacts on sport fishes, especially trophy Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, we assessed the relative abundance of Burbot and quantified the potential trophic or food web impacts of this population by using diet, stable isotope, and bioenergetic analyses. We did not detect a significant potential for food resource competition between Burbot and Lake Trout (Schoener's overlap index = 0.13), but overall consumption by Burbot likely affects other sport fishes, as indicated by our analyses of trophic niche space. Diet analyses suggested that crayfish were important diet items across time (89.3% of prey by weight in autumn; 49.4% in winter) and across Burbot size-classes (small: 77.5% of prey by weight; medium: 76.6%; large: 39.7%). However, overall consumption by Burbot increases as water temperatures cool, and fish consumption by Burbot in FGR was observed to increase during winter. Specifically, large Burbot consumed more salmonids, and we estimated (bioenergetically) that up to 70% of growth occurred in late autumn and winter. Further, our population-wide consumption estimates indicated that Burbot could consume up to double the biomass of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked annually (>1.3 x 10(5) kg; >1 million individuals) into FGR. Overall, we provide some of the first information regarding Burbot trophic interactions outside of the species' native range; these findings can help to inform the management of sport fisheries if Burbot range expansion occurs elsewhere.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000387600000020

Hatchery-reared P. olivaceus (ca. 100 mm in total length) released in stock enhancement programs also consume mysids. To examine whether stocking is implemented within the available carrying capacity, we assessed the feeding relationships among fishes, based on the stomach contents of fishes collected off the coast of Fukushima, Japan. Similarity in diet suggested that 10 species, particularly the poacher Occella iburia and nibe croaker Nibea mitsukurii were potential competitors of P. olivaceus juveniles for food. Large inter-annual variability in the abundance of these competitors was observed, suggesting variability in their consumption of mysids. The predominant mysid Orientomysis mitsukurii was abundant every year, and growth rates of wild P. olivaceus, estimated from otolith microstructure, were mostly high (>1 mm d(-1)), even in the year when wild P. olivaceus were highly abundant. In our statistical model, abundance of mysids and consumption of mysids by fishes significantly affected the growth rates of wild P. olivaceus but only accounted for a small proportion (i.e. explained 2.2 and 2.4% of variance, respectively) of the total compared to the body size of juveniles (30.0%) and bottom water temperature (4.5%). These results suggest that the productivity of mysids is usually high enough to support the production of mysid consumers, but exceptionally high abundances of wild P. olivaceus or other competitors can reduce the available carrying capacity. In such a situation, stocking should be restricted so as not to reduce productivity of wild fishes.									14	0	0	0	15	0	15			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000317356300012

As live corals are lost and their skeletons eroded, the structural complexity of reefs declines. This may have important consequences for the survival and growth of reef fish because complex habitats mediate predator-prey interactions [1, 2] and influence competition [3-5] through the provision of prey refugia. A positive correlation exists between structural complexity and reef fish abundance and diversity in both temperate and tropical ecosystems [6-10]. However, it is not clear how the diversity of available refugia interacts with individual predator-prey relationships to explain emergent properties at the community scale. Furthermore, we do not yet have the ability to predict how habitat loss might affect the productivity of whole reef communities and the fisheries they support. Using data from an unfished reserve in The Bahamas, we find that structural complexity is associated not only with increased fish biomass and abundance, but also with nonlinearities in the size spectra of fish, implying disproportionately high abundances of certain size classes. By developing a size spectrum food web model that links the vulnerability of prey to predation with the structural complexity of a reef, we show that these nonlinearities can be explained by size-structured prey refugia that reduce mortality rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size spectrum. Fitting the model with data from a structurally complex habitat, we predict that a loss of complexity could cause more than a 3-fold reduction in fishery productivity.									137	0	0	0	124	2	139			0960-9822	1879-0445		WOS:000335542300024	24746794

This hypothesis is widely accepted, but supporting field evidence has been elusive. Here the connection between size and year-class strength at the early stages is examined for the commercially important Barents Sea stocks of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and herring (Clupea harengus). We show that there is a close link between length and year-class strength at the 0-group stage within and among the populations studied, and that the connection also holds between length at the 0-group stage and strength of recruitment at age 3. Both length and abundance are closely related to temperature. Interannual variability in the temperature conditions is concluded to be the underlying cause of the covariability between growth and year-class strength. We hypothesize that for stocks at the high latitude end of the overall range of the species the environmental signal tends to over-ride density-dependent effects on growth. High temperature will cause a high production of prey items leading to higher growth rates and higher survival through the vulnerable larval and juvenile stages. The duration of the high-mortality and vulnerable stages is also decreased by higher temperature directly increasing the development rate.

Similarly important is understanding how environmental changes and trophic interactions shape future trajectories of key species with potential implications for ecosystem state and service provision. We here present a statistical modeling framework to assess and quantify cumulative effects on the long-term dynamics of the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. Our model integrates linear and non-linear responses to changes in life stage density, climate and predation pressure as well as stochastic processes. We use the integrated life cycle model to simulate copepod dynamics under a combination of stressor scenarios and to identify conditions under which population responses are potentially mitigated or magnified. Our novel modeling approach reliably captures the historical P. acuspes population dynamics and allows us to identify females in spring and younger copepodites in summer as stages most sensitive to direct and indirect effects of the main environmental stressors, salinity and temperature. Our model simulations furthermore demonstrate that population responses to stressors are dampened through density effects. Multiple stressor interactions were mostly additive except when acting on the same life stage. Here, negative synergistic and positive dampening effects lead to a lower total population size than expected under additive interactions. As a consequence, we found that a favorable increase of oxygen and phosphate conditions together with a reduction in predation pressure by 50% each could counteract the negative effect of a 25% decrease in salinity by only 6%. Ultimately, our simulations suggest that P. acuspes will most certainly decline under a potential freshening of the Baltic Sea and increasing temperatures, which is conditional on the extent of the assumed climate change. Also the planned nutrient reduction strategy and fishery management plan will not necessarily benefit the temporal development of P. acuspes. Moving forward, there is a growing opportunity for using population modeling in cumulative effects assessments. Our modeling framework can help here as simple tool for species with a discrete life cycle to explore stressor interactions and the safe operating space under future climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2296-7745		WOS:000533252500001

Migratory birds depend on broad-scale weather patterns to inform timing of movements, but may be more susceptible to local weather patterns during sedentary periods. We constructed Bayesian integrated population models (IPMs) to assess whether continental or local weather effects best explained population dynamics in an environmentally sensitive aerial insectivorous bird, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), along a transcontinental gradient from British Columbia to Saskatchewan to New York, and tested whether population dynamics were synchronous among sites. Little consistency existed among sites in the demographic rates most affecting population growth rate or in correlations among rates. Juvenile apparent survival at all sites was stable over time and greatest in New York, whereas adult apparent survival was more variable among years and sites, and greatest in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Fledging success was greatest in Saskatchewan. Local weather conditions explained significant variation in adult survival in Saskatchewan and fledging success in New York, corroborating the hypothesis that local more than continental weather drives the population dynamics of this species and, therefore, demographic synchrony measured at three sites was limited. Nonetheless, multi-population IPMs can be a powerful tool for identifying correlated population trajectories caused by synchronous demographic rates, and can pinpoint the scale at which environmental drivers are responsible for changes. We caution against applying uniform conservation actions for populations where synchrony does not occur or is not fully understood.									30	0	0	0	29	0	30			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000410497400011	28573381

Shell growth, reproduction and mortality of Ovula ovum in southern Kyushu, Japan								JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES				75				35	40		10.1093/mollus/eyn034				FEB 2009	2009	Seasonal shell growth, reproduction and mortality of the egg cowry Ovula ovum were studied from May 2004 to October 2006 in southern Kyushu, Japan, an area at the northern margin of its geographic distribution. Rapid shell growth was observed during the period of warmer ocean temperature (May-October). Average shell growth rate of small cowries was 2.84 mm/week. Reproductive activities were observed during most of the year except during the coldest period (March-April). Egg cowries reach maturity at approximately 7 cm in shell length, and at 1 year of age. Average shell length of brooding females and copulating pairs (female and male) were 8.14 +/- 0.40, 8.17 +/- 0.49 and 8.08 +/- 0.43 cm (mean +/- SE), respectively. High mortality rates (average 67.5%) were observed from December to May. The maximum numbers of empty shells in the field (April 2005, May 2006) were seen during the period of the lowest ocean temperatures (March 24, 2005; March 7, 2006). This suggests that ocean temperature may be an important factor for egg cowry populations at the northern margins of their geographical distribution, and that O. ovum may increase fitness with rapid shell growth and early age of maturation.									3	0	0	0	5	0	5			0260-1230			WOS:000262525800005

Sea urchins exposed to near-future elevated seawater temperature alter resource allocation under low-quality food conditions								MARINE BIOLOGY				165	3					43	10.1007/s00227-018-3301-7				MAR 2018	2018	The sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus inhabits seagrass meadows in the northern Gulf of Mexico where seasonal high temperatures are already capable of inducing physiological stress. Climate change will increasingly expose individuals to longer periods of elevated temperature. Sea urchins (n = 12 per treatment) were chronically exposed for a period of 90 days to ambient early summer temperature (26 degrees C) and a near-future predicted summer temperature (30 degrees C). Feeding and absorption efficiencies were measured in sea urchins fed a diet of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum embedded in agar. Test diameter and height, and total wet weight were recorded for each individual every 30 days. Mean spine length and diameter were also recorded for each individual at days 0 and 90. During the first 60 days, there were no significant differences in feeding rate, absorption efficiency, or growth of individuals held in the ambient (26 degrees) or elevated (30 degrees C) temperature treatment. However, after 90 days, sea urchins exposed to 30 degrees C exhibited reduced rates of feeding, lower levels of total organic content in the Aristotle's lantern, and thinner spines than those held at ambient temperature. Accordingly, despite the ability of L. variegatus to feed efficiently and sustain growth at predicted near-future seawater temperature for 60 days, after 90 days, individuals had significantly reduced their allocation of resources to skeletal components (spines and lantern). These findings suggest that in the near-future, chronic exposure to elevated temperature may compromise feeding through inadequate maintenance of the lantern and increase vulnerability to crushing predators through a reduction in spine diameter. Both factors could alter the role of L. variegatus as a key player in seagrass ecosystems.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000426765000013

The lake is species-depauperate, with no major lake trout embryo predators. We hypothesized that without this predation threat, lake trout free embryo feeding and growth may be greater than in their native range, leading to increased survival of age-0 individuals and rapid population growth. We compared length, developmental rate, and feeding patterns of lake trout free embryos captured at a spawning site in Yellowstone Lake with free embryos captured in their native range in Lake Champlain, Vermont. More embryos were feeding, contained more food, and were significantly longer at the same developmental stages in Yellowstone Lake. With an abundance of available food and minimal threat of predation, free embryos remained on the spawning site in Yellowstone Lake later into the summer than in Lake Champlain and achieved a greater maximum length before they dispersed. Greater food consumption and associated growth likely leads to high survival of lake trout free embryos in Yellowstone Lake, contributing to rapid population growth.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000516746000006

Here, we develop an end-to-end model by coupling existing models that describe the dynamics of low (ROMS-N(2)P(2)Z(2)D(2)) and high trophic levels(OSMOSE). ROMS-N(2)P(2)Z(2)D(2) is a biogeochemical model representing phytoplankton and zooplankton seasonal dynamics forced by hydrodynamics in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. OSMOSE is an individual-based model representing the dynamics of several species of fish, linked through opportunistic and size-based trophic interactions. The models are coupled through a two-way size-based predation process. Plankton provides prey for fish, and the effects of predation by fish on the plankton are described by a plankton mortality term that is variable in space and time. Using the end-to-end model, we compare the effects of two-way coupling versus one-way forcing of the fish model with the plankton biomass field. The fish-induced mortality on plankton is temporally variable, in part explained by seasonal changes in fish biomass. Inclusion of two-way feedback affects the seasonal dynamics of plankton groups and usually reduces the amplitude of variation in abundance (top-down effect). Forcing and coupling lead to different predicted food web structures owing to changes in the dominant food chain which is supported by plankton (bottom-up effect). Our comparisons of one-way forcing and two-way coupling show how feedbacks may affect abundance, food web structure and food web function and emphasise the need to critically examine the consequences of different model architectures when seeking to predict the effects of fishing and climate change.

The problem of assessing predator impact is especially difficult in large systems that do not allow for comparisons across multiple units (e.g., small lakes) that have varying predator density. For instance, the invasion of the predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, into the Laurentian Great Lakes contributed to the nearly complete disappearance of several zooplankton species, but current effects on extant zooplankton are not well understood. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) applied to long-term data time series (1994-2012) to examine B. longimanus effects on zooplankton species in Lake Michigan. Because B. longimanus abundance varied over time, our approach allowed assessment of predator effects from field data while accounting for other factors, including food resources, temperature, and seasonality. Results suggest that B. longimanus substantially reduces some zooplankton population growth rates, with the largest effects on species that B. longimanus affected more strongly in experiments. For example, at maximum B. longimanus abundance, Daphnia mendotae, Bosmina longirostris, and Diacyclops thomasi population growth rates were estimated to be reduced by 17%, 30%, and 21%, respectively, compared to no effect on calanoid copepods. Results further indicated positive temperature effects on population growth that differed by species. Our study thus provides field-based evidence for ongoing impacts of invasive species and temperature on zooplankton production and composition, with potential consequences for planktivorous fish, and exemplifies how GAMs can be used to determine predator effects from time series data.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000488564300001

We synthesized information on the ecological roles of two species, Thysanoessa raschii, which predominates over the Middle and Inner Shelf Domains, and Thysanoessa inermis, which predominates over the Outer Shelf Domain. Although estimates of euphausiid biomass across the shelf are not well constrained, we estimated that, between April and July, 2004-2010, euphausiid biomass was 3.08-5.25 g C m(-2) on the outer shelf and 1.95-3.92 g C m(-2) on the middle shelf. Modeled estimates of euphausiid production, for spring and summer combined, varied between 0.043 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 0.051 g C m(-2) d(-1), depending on location, with a mean of 0.048 g C m(-2) d(-1). Recently reported field measurements of annual primary production over the southeastern Bering Sea in 2008-2009 vary between 0.06 and 6.65 g C m(-2) d(-1), with a mean of 1.262 g C m(-2) d(-1) +/- 2.049 g C m(-2) d(-1) in spring and summer combined, a level sufficient to support euphausiids, at least on an annualized basis. Walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, hereafter pollock) is the single most important consumer of euphausiids over the eastern Bering Sea shelf. We estimated that pollock consumed between 0.0042 and 0.019.7 g C m(-2) d(-1) of euphausiids, depending on year, with a mean of 0.011 g C m(-2) d(-1) in summer averaged over 1999-2009. This consumption is equivalent to between 17% and 29% of summer euphausiid production, depending on location.Over the period for which data were available (2004-2012), we observed a strong negative relationship between euphausiid biomass as determined in acoustic surveys and pollock biomass as estimated in the eastern Bering Sea pollock stock assessment (r(2)=0.82). During this time period, sea-surface temperature was the second strongest predictor of euphausiid biomass, (r(2)=0.63). However, for the period 2004-2010, bottom temperature (r(2)=0.94) was the strongest predictor, followed by pollock biomass from the pollock stock assessment (r(2)=0.82), and sea-surface temperature (r(2)=0.81). Mean pollock density in the acoustic surveys was not a powerful predictor of euphausiid biomass during either period. In spatially explicit multiple regression analyses for the periods 2004-2012 and 2004-2010 those formulations that included sea-surface and bottom temperatures as well as survey estimates of pollock had the greatest explanatory value. However, when either or both temperature terms were dropped, the explanatory value of the models dropped considerably. When pollock biomass was dropped from the models, there was little change in explanatory value compared to the full model. Euphausiid production and pollock consumption data coupled with a negative relationship between euphausiid biomass and stock assessment estimates of pollock biomass indicate a top-down predation effect. However, strong negative relationships between euphausiid biomass and water temperatures indicate the influence of a bottom-up mechanism. The apparent differences in these results may relate to the different spatial and temporal scales used to assess the pollock biomass used in the analyses. Alternatively, euphausiid biomass may be strongly controlled during a restricted portion of the year, such as spring, if critical food needs are not met in some years. We lack the data necessary to resolve these alternative hypotheses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									15	0	0	0	5	0	15			0967-0645	1879-0100		WOS:000390510500015		
J	Pitcher, Kristopher A.; Soluk, Daniel A.								Inter-patch connectivity and intra-patch structure differentially alter prey consumption by multiple predators								ECOSPHERE				7	11					e01598	10.1002/ecs2.1598				NOV 2016	2016	Structural habitat complexity (SHC) and functional habitat connectivity (FHC) have important effects on predator-prey interactions and exert a strong influence on community structure/dynamics in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although these factors vary simultaneously in most systems, their interactive effects are poorly understood. Using artificial pond mesocosms and multiple prey types, we manipulated plant density (SHC: low, high) and inter-patch distance (FHC: short, long) in a full factorial design to test for potential interactive effects of these factors on competition and predation by a dragonfly larva (Anax junius) and fish predator (Lepomis cyanallus). When inter-patch distances (FHC) were short, A. junius consumed more amphipods (36% +/- 4.6%) compared with long treatments (19% +/- 4.8%). We detected no significant effects of plant density (SHC) on prey consumption by A. junius. There were significant interactive effects of FHC and SHC on Lepomis cyanellus consumption of amphipods and damselflies. The most counterintuitive of these effects was that sunfish consumed more larval damselflies at high plant density (64% +/- 6.0%) than at low plant density (38% +/- 8.6%) but only in short connection treatments. This interactive effect of SHC and FHC on damselfly predation by L. cyanellus was likely because damselflies exhibited riskier behavior at higher SHC. Prey consumption with both predators present was additive, but no significant effect of either SHC or FHC on interspecific predation was detected, suggesting compensatory foraging responses. Structural habitat complexity and FHC interactively influence predator foraging behavior in complex, non-intuitive ways that are highly dependent on the predator/prey combination in question. Structural habitat complexity and FHC are currently being influenced by anthropogenic factors in multiple ways (e.g., habitat loss, global climate change), and being able to predict the responses of biotic communities to these changes should be an important consideration in restoration and conservation efforts.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2150-8925			WOS:000392207600024

AT TWO LEVELS OF TEMPERATURE								POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				57	2			353	361						2009	2009	Direct environmental impact and microevolutionary pressure may both shape the phenotype by acting synergistically (cogradient) or antagonistically (countergradient). An experimental approach is therefore needed to determine which environmental challenges are responsible for the observed inter-population variation in a phenotypic trait and if such variation is adaptive. Rana temporaria L. larvae were reared in a factorial experiment, with two temperature regimes (differential of 6 degrees C) and larvae originating from two source populations in Poland: a montane pond in the Babia Gora. National Park (elevation 1025 m) and a lowland swamp near Warszawa (elevation 100 in). Populations did not differ in early larval growth rates or in the length of the larval period. In both populations, the early rates of development were higher and the larval period was expectably and substantially shorter at higher temperature. The montane larvae were heavier at metamorphosis than the lowland larvae, but significantly so only at the low temperature treatment. The observed patterns of responses partially conform to the cogradient model of phenotypic variation, in which both environmental and selective effects are mutually enhancing the differentiation of populations.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1505-2249			WOS:000267250200014

Two of the major allelochemicals in tomato were used: chlorogenic acid and tomatine. Predator performance was negatively affected by both chlorogenic acid-fed and tomatine fed-prey, and there were allelochemical by thermal regime interactions for both. Relative consumption rate and growth rate decreased at the higher levels of tomatine at the warmer thermal regime (summer conditions) but were unaffected at the cooler thermal regime (spring conditions). At the cooler thermal regime, stadium duration was prolonged when the predators were given chlorogenic acid-fed prey, but at the warmer thermal regime there was no such effect. There were several effects of gender: biomass gained, food consumed, relative growth rate and efficiency of conversion of ingested food to biomass were higher for females than males. Furthermore, the effects of thermal regime and tomatine on food consumption and biomass gained differed for females and males. In general, the hypothesis that generalist insect predators may be a selective pressure shaping host plant range of insect herbivores was supported by these results. But the occurrence of allelochemical by thermal regime interactions means that it will be difficult to determine the relative importance of plant chemistry versus predators on patterns of feeding specialization by herbivores without taking into account a third factor, temperature.									21	1	0	0	19	3	22			0029-8549			WOS:A1997WE99300011	28307178

Understanding the effect of temperature variations on its demography and predation rate is necessary to predict the population dynamics of this beetle against cotton mealy bug. Age-stage, two sex life tables of zigzag beetle were constructed at three different temperature regimes: 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C and 27 +/- 0.5 degrees C with 60-70% R.H. and ambient condition (32 +/- 4 degrees C; 16-50% R.H.) with 14:10 h (L:D) photoperiod using cotton mealy bug as a host. According to the results, the immature duration and adult longevity were comparatively longer at lower temperature (24 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and shorter at higher temperatures. Among population dynamic parameters, net reproductive rate (R-0) was 216.52, 105.99 and 27.07 off-springs per individual, intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0.1543, 0.1600 and 0.1518 off-springs per female per day at 27 +/- 0.5, 24 +/- 0.5, and 32 +/- 4.0 degrees C, respectively. Survival rate (s(xj)) and age-stage specific fecundity (f(x7)) were greater at 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Among immature stages, 4th instar was the most voracious with highest predation rate. Adult females consumed more cotton mealy bug nymphs at 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Net predation rate (C-0) of the beetle was 5548, 4463.2 and 2016.90 at 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 27 +/- 0.5 degrees C and 32 +/- 4 degrees C, respectively. The values of transformational rate (Q(p)) exhibited that 25.62, 42.11 and 74.50 nymphs of P. solenopsis were required per female beetle to lay one egg at 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 27 +/- 0.5 degrees C and 32 +/- 4 degrees C, respectively. Finite predation rate (omega) was more (7.64) at 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C followed by 27 +/- 0.5 degrees C (6.56) and the lowest at 32 +/- 4 degrees C (0.66). Adult beetles proved strong natural enemies of P. solenopsis. Our study provides detailed basic information for successful rearing of M. sexmaculatus in the laboratory and use as a bio-control agent against cotton mealy bug in the field at different temperature conditions.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			0030-9923			WOS:000447592500035

Analysis of stomach contents and consumption estimates based on collections of fish every 3 h over three 24-h periods in summer 2002/2003 revealed that feeding always occurred during both day and night, with no obvious peaks. We also estimated the gastric evacuation rate of G. auratus in a laboratory experiment using the two prey species found to be dominant in stomachs of field-sampled fish. The relationship was best described by an exponential model, with rate parameters (R) of 0.104 and 0.081 for the evacuation of the amphipod, Austrochiltonia australis, and the cladoceran, Daphnia carinata, at water temperatures of 11.5 and 16.5 degrees C, respectively. Daily ration of G. auratus in summer was estimated to be approximately 3% (dry body weight) using the models of Elliot & Persson and Eggers. Galaxias auratus appears to be unusual in that its feeding pattern cannot be classified as nocturnal, diurnal or crepuscular, but its gastric evacuation and daily ration estimates are still similar to other comparable Northern Hemisphere freshwater fishes.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000242804200018

In the mariculture grounds of Japanese scallops (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) in north-eastern Japan, two sea star species, Asterias amurensis (AA) and Distolasterias nipon (DN), are serious predators. However, the predatory impact of these sea stars on scallops remains unquantified, with limited information being available on the biological characteristics of DN. We compared the predatory impact of both sea star species by evaluating their predatory behaviour (i.e. probability of predation and number of captured scallops) on scallops in laboratory experiments. Both sea star species preferred smaller scallops over large ones, with the probability of predation and the number of scallops being preyed on increasing with increasing water temperature. However, DN had a greater predation impact than AA. For instance, the probability of predation by DN was higher, with more scallops being consumed. In particular, compared to AA, DN continuously captured small scallops and fed on larger scallops. Furthermore, the predatory impact of both sea star species (particularly DN) on small scallops peaked at high temperatures. In conclusion, our results present information that could help improve the survival rate of seeded scallops in mariculture systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000479275500013

Two different temperature (Delta 0 A degrees C and Delta 6 A degrees C) and three light scenarios (62, 57 and 49 % of the natural surface light intensity on sunny days), mimicking increasing cloudiness as predicted for warmer winters in the Baltic Sea region, were simulated. By combining experimental and modeling approaches, we were able to test for a potential dietary mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Two general predator-prey models, one representing the community as a tri-trophic food chain and one as a 5-guild food web were applied to test for the consequences of different temperature sensitivities of heterotrophic components of the plankton. During the experiments, we observed reduced time-lags between the peaks of phytoplankton and protozoan biomass in response to warming. Microzooplankton peak biomass was reached by 2.5 day A degrees C-1 earlier and occurred almost synchronously with biomass peaks of phytoplankton in the warm mesocosms (Delta 6 A degrees C). The peak magnitudes of microzooplankton biomass remained unaffected by temperature, and growth rates of microzooplankton were higher at Delta 6 A degrees C (mu(a dagger 0 A degrees C) = 0.12 day(-1) and mu(a dagger 6 A degrees C) = 0.25 day(-1)). Furthermore, warming induced a shift in microzooplankton phenology leading to a faster species turnover and a shorter window of microzooplankton occurrence. Moderate differences in the light levels had no significant effect on the time-lags between autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass and on the timing, biomass maxima and growth rate of microzooplankton biomass. Both models predicted reduced time-lags between the biomass peaks of phytoplankton and its predators (both microzooplankton and copepods) with warming. The reduction of time-lags increased with increasing Q(10) values of copepods and protozoans in the tritrophic food chain. Indirect trophic effects modified this pattern in the 5-guild food web. Our study shows that instead of a mismatch, warming might lead to a stronger match between protist grazers and their prey altering in turn the transfer of matter and energy toward higher trophic levels.									37	3	0	0	35	0	39			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000310586900008

It occurred throughout the year, being least abundant in early spring and mid-summer, and most abundant in early summer. The mid-summer decline of the population might be attributed to predation by the lobate ctenophore Bolinopsis mikado Moser. The composition of mature specimens, for which the sex was identified, varied at short intervals and did not show any seasonal trend (annual mean: 7.7%). Mean trunk length of mature animals was correlated negatively to water temperature. Change in population biomass showed a similar seasonal pattern observed in numerical abundance. The instantaneous growth rate of O. dioica was calculated from body carbon weights of newly hatched and mature specimens and the time from hatching to spawning. Estimated annual production rate was 953 mg C . m(-3)yr(-1) (= 7.15 g C . m(-2). yr(-1)), 62% of which was attained between May and July. Another appendicularian species, Fritillaria haplostoma Fol, occurred only in early fall, at much lower densities than O. dioica.									65	2	0	0	52	3	69			0022-0981			WOS:A1995RH87400001

The survival of first instars of F. occidentalis was initially determined by themselves. Then the number of first instars that were killed by a single female adult of A. cucumeris was determined for the same density of thrips. The differences in the mortality between the two experiments were used to calculate the rate of predation by A. cucumeris under a range of temperature and VPD regimes. Rate of predation was expressed as the number of thrips killed per h to account for the different time periods that the trials lasted. A quadratic model was fitted to the data. At a constant temperature, the rate of predation decreased with increasing VPD for VPDs less than or equal to 1.24 to 1.44 kPa. Above these VPDs, the rate of predation started to increase again. At a constant VPD, the rate of predation decreased slightly at the lower temperatures and increased at the higher temperatures. The rate of change was dependent upon the VPD. By using the quadratic model, the rate of predation can be predicted for the range of hygrothermal conditions that would be encountered in the greenhouse. The optimal condition for maximum rate of predation by A. cucumeris on first instars of F. occidentalis in the greenhouse is a VPD less than or equal to 0.75 kPa at the recommended production temperatures and VPDs (17 to 25 degrees C and less than or equal to 1.5 kPa).									33	2	0	0	32	0	39			0013-8703			WOS:A1996TU20800004

First, static food-web models were used to analyze basic ecological parameters and indicators of squids: biomass, production, consumption, trophic level, omnivory index, predation mortality diet, and the ecological role. In addition, we developed various dynamic temporal simulations using two food-web models that included squids in their parameterization, and we investigated potential impacts of fishing pressure and environmental conditions for squid populations and, consequently, for marine food webs. Our results showed that squids occupy a large range of trophic levels in marine food webs and show a large trophic width, reflecting the versatility in their feeding behaviors and dietary habits. Models illustrated that squids are abundant organisms in marine ecosystems, and have high growth and consumption rates, but these parameters are highly variable because squids are adapted to a large variety of environmental conditions. Results also show that squids can have a large trophic impact on other elements of the food web, and top-down control from squids to their prey can be high. In addition, some squid species are important prey of apical predators and may be keystone species in marine food webs. In fact, we found strong interrelationships between neritic squids and the populations of their prey and predators in coastal and shelf areas, while the role of squids in open ocean and upwelling ecosystems appeared more constrained to a bottom-up impact on their predators. Therefore, large removals of squids will likely have large-scale effects on marine ecosystems. In addition, simulations confirm that squids are able to benefit from a general increase in fishing pressure, mainly due to predation release, and quickly respond to changes triggered by the environment. Squids may thus be very sensitive to the effects of fishing and climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									60	1	0	0	46	0	60			0967-0645	1879-0100		WOS:000328592400004

Populations are structured according to size or stage. Growth, energy allocation and stage transitions are affected by environmental conditions of which temperature, photoperiod, water depth and food supply were taken into account. The resulting modelling framework was applied to describe, analyse and predict alterations in populations with continuous development, populations with distinct state structures and interacting populations. Our exemplary applications consider populations of freshwater Amphipoda, Isopoda and Odonata. The model was capable of simulating life cycle alterations in dependence on temperature in interaction with other environmental factors: (1) population dynamics, (2) seasonal regulation, (3) water depth-dependent dispersal, (4) intraguild predation and (5) consumer-resource dynamics.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000310586900019

In this respect, echinoderms are one of the taxa most at risk. Earlier research on the impact of near-future OA on echinoderm larval stages showed negative effects, such as a decreased growth rate, increased mortality, and developmental abnormalities. However, all the long-term studies were performed on planktotrophic larvae while alternative life-history strategies, such as nonfeeding lecithotrophy, were largely ignored. Here, we show that lecithotrophic echinoderm larvae and juveniles are positively impacted by ocean acidification. When cultured at low pH, larvae and juveniles of the sea star Crossaster papposus grow faster with no visible affects on survival or skeletogenesis. This suggests that in future oceans, lecithotrophic species may be better adapted to deal with the threat of OA compared with planktotrophic ones with potentially important consequences at the ecosystem level. For example, an increase in populations of the top predator C. papposus will likely have huge consequences for community structure. Our results also highlight the importance of taking varying life-history strategies into account when assessing the impacts of climate change, an approach that also provides insight into understanding the evolution of life-history strategies.

First-Year Density and Growth as They Relate to Recruitment of White Perch to the Adult Stock in Oneida Lake, New York, 1968-2011								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				145	2			416	426		10.1080/00028487.2015.1131743				2016	2016	Recruitment of fish to the adult stock is often determined early in life, and identifying relationships between first-year abundance and subsequent recruitment has significant implications for monitoring and management. Despite the importance of White Perch Morone americana as both predator and prey in systems where they are abundant, relatively little has been published on their early life history, and their recruitment patterns are generally not well understood. We use data over a period of 44 years to investigate factors related to first-year density and growth of White Perch and their recruitment to the adult stock in Oneida Lake, New York. Simple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between select physical and biological factors and first-year density and growth of White Perch estimated from Miller high-speed sampler and trawl surveys and estimates of year-class recruitment to the adult stock determined from gill-net surveys. Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample size was then used to compare different model structures for predicting age-0 White Perch density and growth and recruitment to the adult stock. Year-classes that were dense at the larval stage tended to have higher densities as juveniles and higher recruitment to the adult stock. Year-classes with higher first-year densities grew slower and experienced higher mortality, but mortality did not compensate for the higher initial densities. The model that best explained White Perch recruitment to the adult stock was composed of larval density and predator biomass, indicating White Perch year-class strength is at least partly determined at the larval stage or earlier in Oneida Lake, and later interactions serve largely to modify initial differences.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000374323600017

In the Canadian Arctic, ice cover in June and November showed a step change in the mid-1990s, with little reduction before that. There was a similar step change in northern Hudson Bay. A long-term dataset on marine birds at Coats Island, Nunavut, revealed that many changes in seabird biology also exhibited an abrupt change at, or soon after, the change in ice conditions. This applied to their diet that switched in the 1990s from one dominated by Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, to one dominated by capelin, Mallotus villosus. Evidence from the proportion of Arctic cod in adult diets suggested that the length of the open-water season may be a good predictor of the switch between Arctic cod and capelin. Other changes, in nestling growth and population trend, may relate to the same ecosystem changes that led to the switch in diet. Abrupt changes, as in the breeding biology of murres at Coats Island, would seem to be characteristic of ecosystem alterations driven by climate change.									26	0	0	0	22	0	28			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000308012000011

Fishes were captured by angling, surgically implanted with radio transmitters, and tracked actively from June through September. Most brook trout (96%) and landlocked salmon (72%) displayed long distance movements (>1 km) to open water bodies (28 June to 4 July) followed by periods of time spent in presumed thermal refugia (5 July to 16 September). Summer water temperature rose above 25 degrees C, near the reported lethal limits for these coldwater species. In contrast, the majority of smallmouth bass (68%), a warmwater species, did not make long distance movements from areas of initial capture, remaining in mainstem sections of the river (28 June to 16 September). Spatial overlap of smallmouth bass and brook trout in the summer is unlikely because brook trout presumably move to thermal refugia during this time. However, interspecific competition between brook trout and landlocked salmon may occur since they select similar habitats June through September.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0270-5060	2156-6941		WOS:000271835100007

We investigated population-level differences (population-by-environment interaction) in sensitivity to food availability and temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity between two clones of K. cochlearis isolated from neighboring populations in Ruidera Natural Park (Spain) with different trophic statuses: Tinaja lake (mesotrophic) and Cueva Morenilla lake (eutrophic). Using common-garden experiments, each clone proved to have a different sensitivity to food availability, with substantial phenotypic differences between them. When rotifers grew at moderate temperature (15.6 degrees C), low food levels were more efficiently used by the Tinaja versus Cueva Morenilla clone, whereas high food levels were more efficiently used by the Cueva Morenilla versus Tinaja clone. The posterior spine was much longer and the lorica wider in the Tinaja versus Cueva Morenilla clone, with no difference in lorica length. Phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences showed that the two populations have the same haplotype. This is the first study to show possible local adaptation by a rotifer species to habitats that consistently differ in food availability. We also detected an intriguing deviation from the expected negative relationship between posterior spine length and temperature. Our experimental results indicate that intermediate temperatures may activate the gene responsible for spine elongation in K. cochlearis. This suggests that rotifers in nature could use water temperature as proxy signal of a change in predation risk before defense is needed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000541832400004	32107306	
J	Moore, MV; Folt, CL; Stemberger, RS								Consequences of elevated temperatures for zooplankton assemblages in temperate lakes								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				135	3			289	319						JAN 1996	1996	This paper is a review of direct and indirect effects of elevated temperatures (greater than or equal to 25 degrees C) on freshwater zooplankton in temperate latitudes. Effects of temperature on aspects of behavior, individual growth, development and reproduction, and population dynamics are compared across zooplankton taxa. Thermal responses vary markedly among co-occurring species and among clones within parthenogenetic species. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can produce a reduction in body size within zooplankton populations. Also, some zooplankton assemblages become increasingly dominated by smaller bodied forms under warm conditions. We hypothesize that certain cold-water zooplankton species show the greatest risk of local extinction during late summer heating events because of their dependence on thermal refugia, and their lack of diapausing or dispersal stages.Indirect effects of elevated temperature mediated by changes in the algal food supply or by altered interspecific interactions are also explored. Elevated temperature can change algal community structure and algal food quality, all of which can affect the outcome of zooplankton interspecific competition. Size-selective predation rates of planktivorous fish are also likely to increase with increasing temperature or when zooplankton are driven from the hypolimnion. The onset of fish feeding is also likely to begin earlier in the season thus reducing the time that large zooplankton are present during the ice-free season. Reductions in the size structure of zooplankton assemblages are likely to alter water clarity, nutrient regeneration and fish abundances.									151	7	0	0	139	2	160			0003-9136			WOS:A1996TT86100001

Among them, predation has a key role in structuring community and population variables, including size-frequency distribution. This study aims to quantify the impact of predation by the notothenioid fish Trematomus bernacchii on the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki-size distribution. We developed a model of this impact that estimates the size distribution of the preyed scallop population, taking into account for the predator-size distribution, sex structure, and daily consumption. Comparing this size distribution of the preyed A. colbecki with the living populations at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica), we were able to detect a relevant impact of fish predation. Fish-size frequency resulted to be the major factor shaping preysize structure, with significant differences between predation by males and females. Our findings, given the key role of the two species in the littoral ecosystem of Terra Nova Bay (Antarctic Special Protected Area 161), fall into the framework of ecosystem management of High Antarctic coastal areas, particularly in the actual context of climate change, and increasing anthropogenic impact.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000406963800008

The reproduction of the central European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), which usually deposits its larvae in first-order streams, in small pool and pond-like habitats, is an example of a recent local adaptation in this species. Here we aimed to quantify the direct and indirect effects of the predatory larvae on the aquatic food webs in the ponds and on the flux of matter between the ponds and adjacent terrestrial habitats. Our estimates are based on biomass data of the present pond fauna as well as on the analysis of stomach content data, growth rates and population dynamics of the salamander larvae in pond habitats. By their deposition of larvae in early spring, female fire salamanders import between 0.07 and 2.86 g dry mass m(-2) larval biomass into the ponds. Due to high mortality rates in the larval phase and the relatively small size at metamorphosis of the pond-adapted salamanders compared to stream-adapted ones, the biomass export of the metamorphosed salamanders clearly falls below the initial biomass import. Catastrophic events such as high water temperatures and low oxygen levels may even occasionally result in mass mortalities of salamander larvae and thus in a net 100 % import of the salamander biomass into the pond food webs. Indirect effects further accelerate this net import of matter into the aquatic habitat, e.g. the feeding of salamanders on aquatic insect larvae with the emergence of terrestrial adults-thus preventing export-and on terrestrial organisms that fall on the water surface (supporting import). This study demonstrates that the adaptation of salamanders to pond reproduction can alter food web linkages across ecosystem boundaries by enhancing the flux of materials and energy from terrestrial (i.e. forest) to the aquatic (i.e. pond) habitat.									39	1	0	0	36	0	39			0029-8549			WOS:000323504300026	23358795

Ages of juvenile alewives were determined from scales during 1978-1983, and ages of juvenile and adult alewives were determined from otoliths during 1984-1992. Indices of abundance for alewives were calculated from spring bottom trawl catches in 1978-1992; zooplankton density and epilimnetic temperature were monitored at two stations during 1981-1991; and salmonine demand each year during 1978-1992 was calculated with a simulation model. Although we encountered 11-year-old alewives, few fish lived longer than 7 years, and most fish in the population were younger than 6 years. Mean sizes at ages 1, 2, and 3 in spring averaged 93 mm (5.1 g), 133 mm (17 g), and 149 mm (22 g), but from age 3 to age 8, mean size increased by only 5-7 mm and 2-3 g per year. Female alewives lived longer than male alewives and were always longer than male alewives at age 4 and older. Epilimnetic temperatures were suitable for rapid growth of juvenile alewives each year. Lake temperature had the potential to affect growth of adults but adult growth was not correlated with temperature suitability indices perhaps because temperature regimes differed among lake regions and alewives were mobile. Growth of alewives was not correlated with salmonine demand for prey. Competition for zooplankton among the two youngest alewife cohorts affected growth of age-1 alewives. Zooplankton density declined sharply in 1986, and should it decline again, growth of age-1 alewives will slow, unless numbers of age-0 alewives fall. Whether growth of age-1 fish declines or numbers of age-0 fish fall, the result of another decline in zooplankton density will be a reduction in the production of alewives needed to support piscivores.									30	0	0	0	30	0	31			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:A1997WK86900009		
J	Dickson, KA								Locomotor muscle of high performance fishes: What do comparisons of tunas with ectothermic sister taxa reveal?								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-PHYSIOLOGY				113	1			39	49		10.1016/0300-9629(95)02056-X				JAN 1996	1996	Many studies of high-performance fishes focus on tunas because they are morphologically adapted for efficient swimming, they migrate long distances and accelerate rapidly, and they successfully exploit the epipelagic marine environment. Tunas have also received attention because, by conserving metabolically generated heat, they elevate the temperature of certain tissues above ambient water temperature; that is, they are endothermic. However, few studies have used phylogenetically based comparisons to determine what is unique about tunas and to elucidate evolutionary trends. This paper compares tunas with their closest relatives, ectothermic fishes of the family Scombridae, and examines characteristics of the myotomal musculature that are related to swimming performance. White muscle anaerobic capacity is significantly greater in tunas chan in ectothermic scombrid fishes, indicating that energy generation for bursts may be greater in tunas. Because tunas have high capacities to buffer metabolic acids within the white muscle and blood, and to recover from exhaustive exercise rapidly, they may be able to burst repeatedly. The white muscle of tunas also has a higher aerobic capacity than that of ectothermic scombrids, which may indicate chat at lease some tuna white muscle fibers are recruited at sustainable speeds or it may be related to rapid lactate turnover or growth races. In contrast, many intracellular characteristics of the red myotomal muscle do not differ significantly between tunas and ectothermic scombrid fishes. Many of these, including mitochondrial ATP production rate and muscle contraction speed, are temperature dependent and are higher at. the higher in vivo red muscle temperatures of tunas. Thus, endothermy may result in elevated aerobic performance levels in tunas, and their high blood hemoglobin concentrations, muscle myoglobin contents, and red muscle capillary densities would ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the active, warm red muscle fibers. However, direct tests of this hypothesis are needed. Much more remains to be learned about tunas and ectothermic scombrids so that more complete phylogenetic analyses can be used to understand the adaptive strategies that have resulted in tunas' success as active epipelagic predators.

Ichthyoplankton populations were sampled weekly from April to June during all years using paired conical nets. Water temperature and zooplankton populations were sampled at each ichthyoplankton sampling site. Approximately, 70% of all larval fishes and 80% of the larval walleyes were sampled in the upper reservoir during all years. Cyprinidae and Centrarchidae were the only taxa that were more abundant in the main reservoir than the upper reservoir. Despite similarities in zooplankton abundance between years, recruitment of walleyes in 1999 was the lowest in nearly 20 years, while moderate year classes were produced in 2000 and 2001. During 1999, low, variable spring temperatures resulted in poor growth of larval walleyes. Poor growth of walleyes, coupled with high densities of larval gizzard shad (Dorosoma ccpedianum), resulted in poor recruitment during 1999. Walleyes grew faster in 2000 and 2001 and were able to consume larval gizzard shad resulting in moderate recruitment. These results suggest that abiotic conditions mediate biotic interactions and that both abiotic and biotic characteristics are important for regulating walleye recruitment dynamics.

JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				64	1-2	SI		26	33		10.1016/j.seares.2010.01.008				JUL-AUG 2010	2010	Habitat quality of a subarctic nursery ground in northern Norway for 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa was investigated by following settlement, mortality and growth during 2005 and 2006. Newly settled individuals were first observed in the end of May to early June and settlement lasted until mid-July. Densities peaked in early July and were comparable to those reported in temperate nursery grounds. Mortality estimates after settlement differed between 0.062 d(-1) in 2005 and 0.025 d(-1) in 2006. Potential predators appeared to be rather similar as those reported in other areas: the brown shrimp Crangon crangon, the shore crab Carcinus maenas and demersal fish species (gadoids). Population mean growth indicated linear growth until August leveling-off afterwards. 0-group plaice reached a lower mean size (5-6 cm) at the end of the growing season than in temperate areas probably due to later settlement timing in combination with lower summer-autumn water temperatures. The comparison of observed growth rates with predictions of maximum growth models indicated a similar pattern as observed in temperate nursery grounds: Growth appeared to be maximal except for the period after summer. Whether or not this was related to changes in food quality throughout the season, to interspecies competition or to emigration remains to be elucidated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial variability in the fecundity of Atlantic sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) in the northern Gulf of Mexico								FISHERY BULLETIN				118	1			51	62		10.7755/FB.118.1.5				2020	2020	Spatial variability in life history characteristics, including age at maturity, growth rates, and reproductive periodicity, has been documented for a number of shark species. Among causative factors hypothesized to induce dissimilarities, clinal variation is most often linked to temperature. However, if spatial differences in prey abundance were the causative factor, it could be masked by clinal variation. If prey abundance is the actual driver, intra-specific differences should be evident over a broad longitudinal range (i.e., constant water temperature) characterized by a demarcation of low and high productivity. In this study, Atlantic sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) were collected for 1 year throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) by using standardized bottom longline gear. Reproductive data were collected from 253 gravid females, and mean (4.2 versus 3.4 embryos) and median (4 versus 3 embryos) brood sizes were higher west of longitude 88 degrees W than to the east. Based on fisheries survey data, spatial trends in abundance of Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), a common prey item, coincided with that of Atlantic sharpnose sharks, and both were more abundant west of 88 degrees W. Although differences in brood sizes appear minor, potential lifetime reproductive output for females was calculated to be over 2 times greater in the western versus the eastern GOM.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-0656	1937-4518		WOS:000555503700005		
J	Kimura, Shingo; Kato, Yoshiki; Kitagawa, Takashi; Yamaoka, Naoki				Kimura, Shingo/AAI-2209-2020				Impacts of environmental variability and global warming scenario on Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) spawning grounds and recruitment habitat								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				86	1-2	SI		39	44		10.1016/j.pocean.2010.04.018				JUL-AUG 2010	2010	Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) have spawning grounds in waters stretching from south of Okinawa to east of Taiwan. This species is typical of fishes that spawn seasonally in small, limited areas. Any marked change in the marine environment of the spawning grounds is likely to have a direct impact on larval survival and growth. We conducted rearing experiments on larvae to investigate these impacts and found that a reduction in temperature resulted in poor growth during the juvenile stage, even if larval survival rates did not change. In the wild, this reduced growth rate is likely to reduce survival rates because smaller juveniles have poorer swimming ability and their ability to avoid predators is also reduced. This is especially important since the Kuroshio current, which connects the spawning grounds to the nursery grounds, transports larvae rapidly because of its faster surface current (the western boundary current), thus larvae arriving too quickly in coastal waters can be exposed to very cold temperatures. An ocean model (MIROC) simulation under a climate warming scenario (IPCC, 2007) predicted that the temperature in the spawning ground would be 3 degrees C higher in 2100 than in present time, while the transport to nursery grounds would also be faster. In this case, the combination of several mechanisms would control the recruitment of juvenile bluefin. On the spawning grounds, high temperatures exceeding the optimal range would increase larvae mortality and any surviving larvae would reach the nursery grounds more quickly, but warmer coastal waters would have less negative impact on their growth. We forced a model of larval drift with MIROC output fields to study the complex response of bluefin tuna recruitment. As a result, the predicted survival rates of larvae arriving in Japanese coastal waters in 2100 would decline to 36% of present recruitment levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modeled biogenic carbon fluxes in the ocean often match measured data poorly and part of this could be because small copepods (<2 mm) are modeled as unicellular feeders grazing on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. The most abundant copepods from a seasonal upwelling region of the Eastern North Atlantic were sorted, and a molecular method was applied to copepod gut contents to evaluate the extent of metazoan predation under two oceanographic conditions, a trophic pathway not accounted for in global models. Scaling up the results obtained herein, based on published field and laboratory estimates, suggests that small copepods could ingest 1.79-27.20 gigatons C/year globally. This ignored metazoan-copepod link could increase current estimates of biogeochemical fluxes (remineralization, respiration, and the biological pump) and export to higher trophic levels by 15.6%-24.4%. It could also account for global discrepancies between measured daily ingestion and copepod metabolic demand/growth. The inclusion of metazoan predation into global models could provide a more realistic role of the copepods in the ocean and if these preliminary data hold true at larger sample sizes and scales, the implications would be substantial at the global scale.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2045-7758			WOS:000451611000020	30519413

This is partly due to the irregular occurrence of driving phenomena such as gelatinous plankton pulses in this realm. Gelatinous plankters rely on their life cycles and histories to exploit temporarily abundant resources with an undeniable, but often overlooked, impact on marine food webs. Dramatic increases of gelatinous filter-feeders and/or carnivores (both native and nonindigenous species) are frequently observed, and explanations of these blooms alternatively invoke ecosystem variability, climate change, unspecified anthropogenic perturbation or removal of top predators from trophic networks. Gelatinous plankters, however, are not anomalies in plankton dynamics: the recognition of the ecological importance of their pulses, based on their life cycle patterns (often involving benthic stages), is a critical breakthrough to understand the cycling diversity of plankton in space and time. The current study focuses on the many neglected aspects of the ecology and biology of gelatinous zooplankton, describes how life cycle patterns are central in marine ecology, as are the pulses of gelatinous organisms, and highlights how such a dramatic lack of knowledge can affect our understanding of the marine ecosystem as a whole.									203	3	1	0	173	5	214			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000254963900026

At 20 degrees C, the filtration rates increased with current velocity up to 20-25 cm.s(-1). Filtration rates remained the same at 26 degrees C. At high phytoplankton concentration (Cryptophyceae: 8 500-11 000 Cryptomonas sp. cells.mL(-1)), filtration rates were low (0.2-0.4 L.h(-1) per standard individual of 1 g dry weight), whereas higher filtration rates (0.5-2.5 L.h(-1) per standard individual) were observed with lower concentrations of the algae Prorocentrum minimum (Dinophyceae : 1 300-5 800 cells.mL(-1)). The filtration rates of M. galloprovincialis were affected by high phytoplankton loads, and exhibited a maximum related to current velocity. Our results suggest that mussels, feeding over a wide range of seston concentrations and flow velocities, show an adaptive behaviour in an area where environmental conditions are known to vary drastically.

However, failing to recognize the additional role of environmental factors in regulating birth and mortality rates can lead to erroneous demographic analyses and conclusions. The North Atlantic right whale population is currently the focus of conservation efforts aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Consistent monitoring of the population since 1980 has revealed evidence that climate-associated changes in prey availability have played an important role in the population's recovery. The considerable interdecadal differences observed in population growth coincide with remote Arctic and North Atlantic oceanographic processes that link to the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Here, we build capture-recapture models to quantify the role of prey availability on right whale demographic transitional probabilities and use a corresponding demographic model to project population growth rates into the next century. Contrary to previous predictions, the right whale population is projected to recover in the future as long as prey availability and mortality rates remain within the ranges observed during 1980-2012. However, recent events indicate a northward range shift in right whale prey, potentially resulting in decreased prey availability and/or an expansion of right whale habitat into unprotected waters. An annual increase in the number of whale deaths comparable to that observed during the summer 2017 mass mortality event may cause a decline to extinction even under conditions of normal prey availability. This study highlights the importance of understanding the oceanographic context for observed population changes when evaluating the efficacy of conservation management plans for endangered marine species.									34	0	0	0	29	0	36			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000426506100065	29084379

Its maximum length is 6.0-6.4 mm; females generally reach maturity when 4 mm long and males when 5 mm long. They breed throughout the year, and juveniles comprised 94% of animals sampled (n = 880). Males comprised only 11% of mature animals in field samples, compared with 40% in field chambers and 67% in the stomachs of nocturnal fish predators. Abundance during the year reflected changes in growth rate (0.050-0.088 mm day-1), mortality rate (0.020-0.069 day-1) and life span (49-102 days). The annual production of Nebalia sp. in seagrass meadows was estimated at 5.8 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) m-2, with a corresponding P:B (production:biomass) ratio of 22.5. Predation is probably the main source of mortality at times of high density of Nebalia sp., and at least three significant fish predators on Nebalia sp. were found. Together with Nebalia sp., small crustaceans with high P:B ratios may have a significant role in secondary production in the seagrass beds at Seven Mile Beach.									22	0	0	0	21	0	22			0067-1940			WOS:A1991EZ63000004

Small Boreal Shield lakes are particularly responsive to weather-induced changes in thermal structure. They are often fishless, with macroinvertebrate predators regulating crustacean zooplankton communities. We performed a mesocosm experiment to examine how thermal structure (stratified and isothermal) influences the predation impact of surface-orienting Buenoa macrotibialis and vertically migrating Chaoborus punctipennis on crustacean zooplankton. We expected predation from surface-orienting predators to be greatest in stratified conditions when food resources are concentrated near the surface in proximity with predators. Surprisingly, surface predators had no effect on zooplankton abundance, and zooplankton avoided surface predators regardless of thermal habitat structure. In contrast, Chaoborus had a strong predation impact and reduced total zooplankton abundance, but only in isothermal conditions. We hypothesize that this predation effect was due to increased predator metabolism, foraging and ingestion rates when migrating through a thermally homogenous warm water column without access to cool bottom waters. These results demonstrate that changes in lake thermal structure may result in strong, unexpected consequences for predator-prey dynamics.									10	1	0	0	11	1	12			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000294554000011

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gut content analysis, thereby deriving a new perspective on community interactions and their responses to environment. For this, we use an elevational gradient in the High Arctic, asking how the environment and species traits interact in shaping predator-prey interactions involving the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis. To characterize the community of potential prey available to this predator, we used pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. To characterize the prey actually consumed, we applied molecular gut content analysis. Using joint species distribution models, we found elevation and vegetation mass to explain the most variance in the composition of the prey community locally available. However, such environmental variables had only a small effect on the prey community found in the spider's gut. These observations indicate that Pardosa exerts selective feeding on particular taxa irrespective of environmental constraints. By directly modelling the probability of predation based on gut content data, we found that neither trait matching in terms of predator and prey body size nor phylogenetic or environmental constraints modified interaction probability. Our results indicate that taxonomic identity may be more important for predator-prey interactions than environmental constraints or prey traits. The impact of environmental change on predator-prey interactions thus appears to be indirect and mediated by its imprint on the community of available prey.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000459345000009	30230073

Juvenile anchovy fed predominately on zooplankton, the main prey items being copepods, and to a lesser extent on molluscs larvae, polychaete larvae and ostracods. Prey composition in the diet of the two cohorts differed from each other, and the vacuity index was significantly lower for the autumn cohort (20%) than for the summer cohort (70%). Juveniles from the summer cohort had higher growth (somatic and otolith growth) and better condition than individuals from the autumn cohort. Growth rates were 0.74 mm d(-1) and 0.59 mm d(-1) respectively. We also found that otolith daily increments widths were higher for the summer cohort. Sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration derived from satellite imagery (SeaWiFS), were used as the main environmental variables to analyze anchovy growth, condition and feeding. No relationships were observed between chlorophyll-a concentration and juvenile vacuity index, nor growth rates and condition. Our study suggests that growth and condition differences among the two cohorts were mainly due to water temperature differences encountered by the fish during their larval and juvenile periods. High growth rates and condition of individuals from the summer cohort may have conferred them ecological advantages and enhanced their survival. It has been suggested that, in this region, late spawned cohorts contribute less to the recruitment of the adult population. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These variables generally peaked in the upper 10 m of the water column. Their seasonal peaks occurred in June and July when water temperature and stratification index were at their highest levels. CilC averaged 22, 8, and 4% of BactC, PhytoC, and POC, respectively . Compared to bacteria, ciliates appeared able to respond more rapidly to an increase in phytoplankton biomass, and were under higher predation pressure. Ciliates were dominated by individuals with sizes (19 to 187 mu m) up to 15 times larger than that of the blooming diatoms. Direct observations revealed protozoan individuals with up to 10 ingested bloom-forming algal cells within their body. Microzooplankton grazing rates (estimated in July 1992 using a dilution technique) in unscreened water samples from the depth of maximum chlorophyll a concentration represented up to 70% (mean +/- SD = 54 +/- 21%) of the phytoplankton growth rates. Microzooplankton grazing rates in prescreened (<160 mu m) water samples were up to 60% higher than in unscreened samples. We conclude that this was due to the removal of a substantial fraction of herbivorous micrograzers by metazoan zooplankton present in unscreened samples, though the phytoplankton assemblage was in a blooming state. These results thus suggest that herbivory by microzooplankton can enhance trophic transfer from the microbial food web to higher trophic levels in the LSLE. This may explain the apparent paradox of low annual algal production and large standing stock of metazoan zooplankton in this environment.									76	0	0	0	66	1	76			0948-3055			WOS:A1995TM59400006		
J	Gillespie, DR; Opit, G; Roitberg, B								Effects of temperature and relative humidity on development, reproduction, and predation in Feltiella acarisuga (Vallot) (Diptera : Cecidomyiidae)								BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				17	2			132	138		10.1006/bcon.1999.0782				FEB 2000	2000	The predatory gall midge Feltiella acarisuga (Vallot) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is a biological control agent for twospotted spider mites on greenhouse vegetable crops. Effects of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on development of immatures, reproduction, and prey capture were determined in order to confirm the suitability of F. acarisuga for use in greenhouses. Developmental time ranged from 10 days at 27 degrees C to 34 days at 15 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, developmental time was significantly shorter at 96% RH than at 84% RH. There was very poor survival of immatures at 64% RH and none at 36%. Lifespan of adult females decreased with increasing temperature, but temperature had no significant effect on number of eggs laid. At 20 degrees C, lifespan was longer at 84 and 96% RH than at 64 or 36% RH. The number of spider mites attacked by 3-day-old larvae over 8 h increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 27 degrees C. The number of mites attacked also increased with increasing RR at 27 degrees C. We conclude that F. acarisuga will complete its life cycle and reproduce under conditions typically found in vegetable greenhouses in northern temperate climates. However, extended periods of low RH (<60% RH) could reduce reproduction and survivorship sufficiently to impair the predator's action against spider mite populations.

Previous investigations of juvenile Tanner crabs have shown considerable variability in size of age-0 yr crabs from different shallow water embayments surrounding Kodiak, Alaska. To determine the proportion of this presumed growth variability that is due to diet quality, we sampled crabs and sediments over 2 yr at nursery sites that had previously demonstrated disparate age-0 yr crab sizes. Juvenile crabs reside at the sediment-water interface and therefore we measured sedimentary grain size and sedimentary organic matter, as well as total lipids per weight, lipid classes and fatty acid biomarkers in both crabs and sediments. Juvenile crabs from sheltered sites, as opposed to exposed sites, were characterized by larger size and by rapid growth rates and higher tissue lipid densities. Further, higher diatom and bacterial fatty acid markers characterized both sedimentary lipids and crab lipids in animals from sheltered bays compared to those from exposed sites. Controlled laboratory experiments were run to determine the relative importance of food quantity (ration) and quality (% lipid) on juvenile growth and condition. We found both diet quantity and quality significantly affected growth and lipid storage of juvenile crabs. Our results point to the importance of trophic factors in defining high quality habitat for a commercially important cold-water crab species.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000434964400012

We examined the effect of wave action on the rate of movement and destructive grazing of a kelp bed by the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) under field conditions. We measured density and rate of advance at fixed intervals along similar to 100 m of a grazing front over 1 year, and quantified individual movement rates in the barrens 5-10 m behind the urchin front using a time-lapse videography. Seasonal variation in the mean rate of advance of the front (range: 0-4 m month(-1)) was explained by changes in urchin density at the front (120-360 individuals m(-2)), which in turn varied inversely with significant wave height (0.5-2 m). Water temperature (0.8-17.6 degrees C) had no effect on the rate of advance or on urchin density (aggregation) at the front, except when temperature exceeded 17 degrees C. Movement of individual urchins also was affected by wave action: we observed a significant decrease in speed and displacement of urchins with increasing significant wave height. Wave action had no effect on the proportion of urchins moving or the degree of linearity of their movements. We propose that the decrease in urchin density at the front associated with increased wave action, results from de-aggregation, which reduces the risk of dislodgement, combined with a reduction in urchin movement in barrens, which supplies new urchins to the front.									65	1	0	0	61	1	67			0025-3162			WOS:000247308000009

Using two highly mobile scallops, Placopecten magellanicus and Argopecten purpuratus, we examined escape response performance and morphometric characteristics as a function of allelic variability at metabolic loci. Ten allozyme systems were used for A. purpuratus and 7 for P. magellanicus. In each species, the morphometric characteristics and escape response parameters were analyzed separately using principal components analysis (PCA) and the scores of the major principal components were related to allozyme heterozygosity. In both P. magellanicus and A. purpuratus, positive correlations were found between MLH and morphometric parameters, but escape response parameters were only positively linked to MLH in P. magellanicus, and then weakly. The hypothesis that MLH improves fitness of pectinids by increasing the capacity to escape predators is not supported.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000293001400020

The survival of nymphs was highest at 28 degrees C (75.57%) and at this temperature female adults O. similis had the longest oviposition period (21.1 d), the greatest fecundity (40.3 eggs) and the highest potential intrinsic rate of increase (r(m): 0.108 d(-1)). These results suggest that O. similis can maintain greater population densities at 28 degrees C than at the other temperatures tested. In addition, the functional response indicates that the attack rate of O. similis (1.04) and the maximum prey capacity (30.7 spider mites per bug in 24 h) are greatest at 28 degrees C. The results of this study provide useful information on the biology and time when to release O. similis in order to reduce the abundance of T. cinnabarinus in cotton fields.									5	3	0	0	7	0	10				1802-8829		WOS:000310716000004

These range shifts are expected to change fish community structure and alter food-web dynamics in subarctic lakes. However, the impacts of invading species on native fish and invertebrate prey communities remain understudied. The trophic ecology of invasive species determines the likelihood of direct resource competition with native taxa. In Northern Europe, perch (Perca fluviatilis), a trophic generalist, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), a benthic specialist, are expanding their distribution ranges northwards, colonising lakes inhabited by a native generalist, whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). We predicted that increased fish diversity and density would deplete the invertebrate community and increase resource competition between native and invasive species. To assess the degree of resource competition between native and invasive species, we compared (i) fish and invertebrate community structure; (ii) diet and stable carbon and nitrogen ratios of whitefish, ruffe and perch and (iii) growth, condition and relative population size of whitefish in two non-invaded lakes with two lakes containing one and two lakes containing both invasive species. Each lake was sampled on a single occasion between August and September. Benthic macroinvertebrate density and community structure were unaffected by increased consumer diversity, while top-down control of pelagic zooplankton density and size was evident in lakes with increased fish diversity. Differences in diet and stable isotope ratios were evident between all whitefish populations, although these were not directly related to the presence of invasive species. Specialised adaptations of invasive species may confer a competitive advantage in invaded lakes; ruffe dominated the profundal niche, while perch displayed an ontogenetic shift to piscivory, reducing niche overlap with native whitefish. Growth rate and population density of whitefish were largely independent of fish community structure and were governed by local variations in lake productivity. However, there was a sign of lowered condition of whitefish in invaded systems. Shallow and more productive lakes with higher food availability supported populations of native and invasive species. Our findings indicate that trophic specialisations of invasive species play a key role in determining their impacts on the systems they invade. This study focussed on early stages of invasion, and the outcome of species interactions may change following the establishment of new species. In addition, these impacts will not be uniform across the invaded landscape as lake-specific variations in morphometry and resource availability will alter the competitive balance between native and invasive species.									26	0	0	0	27	0	27			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000318046300013

A 15-year study								POPULATION ECOLOGY				56	2			341	348		10.1007/s10144-013-0411-4				APR 2014	2014	To devise effective conservation actions, it is important to know which factors are associated with the population parameters of a declining population. Using mark-recapture methods, we estimated the annual population size, growth rate and survival probability of an ear-tagged flying squirrel population over a 15-year period in a 4,500 ha study area in western Finland. The species is considered vulnerable, but detailed knowledge concerning population sizes or trends is lacking. The population parameters and changes therein were regressed against habitat availability, an indicator of predation pressure, and mean winter temperature (an indicator of climate change), to reveal potential reasons for trends in the population. The best-fit models suggested the annual growth rate to be below one, and on average it was 0.93 (+/- 0.06; SE) across the 15-year period. The survival probability was about 0.22 (+/- 0.03) for juveniles and 0.50 (+/- 0.03) for adults. The population size of adult flying squirrels decreased from 65 (+/- 11) individuals in 1995 to 29 (+/- 6) individuals in 2009. The number of flying squirrels was associated with the amount of available habitat, but the decline in population size was more rapid than the loss of habitat area. If the current decreasing trend in habitat availability continues, the population might become extinct by the year 2020. To halt the population decline, it is necessary to refrain from clear-cutting mature spruce stands until new suitable habitats develop from the maturation of younger forests.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1438-3896	1438-390X		WOS:000333352500008

Seedlings from provenances from the middle of the altitudinal ranges of all species were capable of survival for 18 months on sites dominated by the other two species. However, 9 years after planting E. ovata had died out in open vegetation on all sites. In contrast, E. rodwayi had survived in open vegetation on all sites and was the sole or major survivor in the two lower altitude areas. E. gunnii had performed marginally better than E. rodwayi in the open vegetation at the highest altitude site, had survived in the E rodwayi site and had died out in the E. ovata site. The results of field trials, and experiments in the glasshouse and laboratory, suggested that E. ovata is absent from open vegetation at the higher altitudes because of its susceptibility to frost, that E. rodwayi dominates the middle altitudes because of its superior frost resistance, that E, gunnii dominates the highest altitudes because of superior growth rates to E. rodwayi in misty and cool conditions, and that E. ovata is dominant at low altitudes because of its superior growth rates in warm conditions. Recent climatic changes are posited to have had some effect on the results of the field experiment.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			0307-692X			WOS:000079671300004

Two questions plague science and policy. First, what level of reduction in live organism discharges from ships yields a given desired level of reduction in species establishment probability? Second, how can this question be empirically tested in a practicable and replicable manner? We evaulated the extent to which experiments using 1 m(3) mesocosms could help elucidate a relationship between inoculation density and reproductive output (a proxy for establishment probability) of a surrogate invader, Bythotrephes longimanus (Crustacea: Cladocera). The inoculation densities were 1, 5, 10, 20, or 40 individuals m(-3). All individuals in each inoculum were added as a single event at the start of each of four, two-week-long experiments. B. longimanus were inoculated into ambient water pumped from the Duluth-Superior Harbor at the start of each experiment between June and August, 2015. The mesocosm volume and range of inoculation densities has relevancy to the International Maritime Organization's Ballast Water Management Convention D2 standard which allows a density of < 10 viable organisms m(-3) in discharged ballast water for organisms > 50 mu m minimum dimension. Reproductive output was detected among 78 of 80 mesocosms after 2 weeks. Among 13 abiotic and biotic variables, inoculation density was overwhelmingly the best predictor, and water temperature was the second best predictor, of B. longimanus reproductive output. Net reproductive value of the inoculants was >= 1 among 35 of 80 mesocosms after 2 weeks. There was evidence for density-dependent reduction in population growth rate in the higher inoculation density mesocosms. We examined various parts of our method for robustness. Translation of the results into meaningful estimates of establishment probability in the field remains a vivid challenge. We introduce the idea of using annual hatching rates of natural banks of dormant eggs in lake sediments as a method to characterize relationships between propagule pressure and establishment probability at the scale of an ecosystem for seasonally transient species such as B. longimanus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000492419000016

Abundance of northern squawfish with transmitters peaked in July, appeared to be inversely related to river discharge, and occurred after most juvenile salmonids had moved past Lower Granite Dam. Distributions of northern squawfish in the tailrace varied between and within years and shifted in relation to changing Bow patterns, water temperatures, and diel cycles, but northern squawfish consistently used low-velocity habitats. Changes in distribution and abundance of northern squawfish in the tailrace suggest that juvenile salmonids migrating in the spring and early summer will be less affected by predation than juveniles migrating later in the summer. Northern squawfish did not concentrate downstream from an infrequently used juvenile bypass outfall, but several individuals were repeatedly found 30 m upstream from the bypass outfall, near the continuous discharge from a large pipe. Northern squawfish habituation to the predictable discharge suggests that predation could become a problem at the bypass outfall if it were used regularly to return juvenile migrants to the river.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0002-8487			WOS:A1996VJ08900013

We used a spatially-explicit three-dimensional (3-D) model that divided the heterogeneous habitat of Chesapeake Bay into over 4,000 cubes. Each cube represented a volume of water that was characterized by a specific set of environmental variables (phytoplankton biomass, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) driven by the 3-D water quality model. Foraging and bioenergetics models transformed the environmental variables into measures of potential growth rates of menhaden. Potential carrying capacity of menhaden was estimated as a function of phytoplankton production, menhaden consumption rate, and potential growth rate, combining phytoplankton production, thermal habitat, and menhaden physiology into one ecological value that is a measure of habitat quality from the perspective of the fish. Seasonal analysis of the Chesapeake Bay carrying capacity for Atlantic menhaden suggested two bottleneck periods: one in early June and a second during the fall. The fall bottleneck in carrying capacity was at about 10 billion age-0 fish. Annual recruitment of age-0 menhaden for the entire Atlantic coast of the U.S. ranged from 1.2-18.6 billion fish between 1955 and 1986. It appears that carrying capacity of Chesapeake Bay does not limit the coastwide production of young menhaden. Any conditions such as nutrient reduction strategies, further eutrophication, or global climatic warming, that may influence the carrying capacity during the fall or early June periods, may ultimately alter coastwide abundance of menhaden through changes in Chesapeake Bay carrying capacity.									48	2	0	0	42	0	51			0160-8347			WOS:000170948800007

GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				18	6			1843	1853		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02645.x				JUN 2012	2012	Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition has shifted many ecosystems from nitrogen (N) limitation to phosphorus (P) limitation. Although well documented in plants, no study to date has explored whether N deposition exacerbates P limitation at higher trophic levels, or focused on the effects of induced plant P limitation on trophic interactions. Insect herbivores exhibit strict N:P homeostasis, and should therefore be very sensitive to variations in plant N:P stoichiometry and prone to experiencing deposition-induced P limitation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of N deposition and P availability on a plant-herbivorous insect system. Using common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and two of its specialist herbivores, the monarch caterpillar (Danaus plexippus) and milkweed aphid (Aphis asclepiadis) as our study system, we found that experimental N deposition caused P limitation in milkweed plants, but not in either insect species. However, the mechanisms for the lack of P limitation were different for each insect species. The body tissues of A. asclepiadis always exhibited higher N:P ratios than that of the host plant, suggesting that the N demand of this species exceeds P demand, even under high N deposition levels. For D. plexippus, P addition increased the production of latex, which is an important defense negatively affecting D. plexippus growth rate. As a result, we illustrate that P limitation of herbivores is not an inevitable consequence of anthropogenic N deposition in terrestrial systems. Rather, species-specific demands for nutrients and the defensive responses of plants combine to determine the responses of herbivores to P availability under N deposition.									43	1	0	0	42	0	44			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000303763600007

The predator-induced and temperature-induced growth accelerations were the same at both latitudes, despite considerably faster growth rates in the southern populations. While the higher growth rates in the southern populations and the high rearing temperature were driven by both an increased food intake and a higher growth efficiency, the higher growth rates under predation risk were completely driven by a higher growth efficiency, despite a lowered food intake. 4. The emerging pattern that higher growth rates associated with latitude, temperature and predation risk were all (partly or completely) mediated by a higher growth efficiency has two major implications. First, it indicates that energy allocation trade-offs and the associated physiological costs play a major role both in shaping large-scale geographic variation in growth rates and in shaping the extent and direction of growth rate plasticity. Secondly, it suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food chains, where damselfly larvae are important intermediate predators, will be higher in southern populations, at higher temperatures and under predation risk. This may eventually contribute to the lengthening of food chains under these conditions and highlights that the prey identity may determine the influence of predation risk on food chain length.									58	1	0	0	58	0	61			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000307343100012	22524392

We review and synthesize studies investigating causes of these declines focusing on the Sarapiqui region of the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica. We discuss evidence for five potential causes of population declines motivated by current understanding of the effects of fragmentation, disturbance of remnant forests, climate change, and their possible interactions: (1) reduced forest area increases the probability of stochastic extirpation; (2) reduced connectivity among forest patches decreases population rescue opportunities; (3) degradation of preferred microhabitats due to, for example, abundant large mammals, jeopardizes specialized birds' foraging opportunities; (4) high nest predation rates reduce productivity below replacement levels; and (5) changes in macro- and microclimate increase energetic demands and reduce survival. Our review documents how tropical forest loss and degradation likely Impact understory birds through a variety of direct, indirect, and interrelated causes spanning multiple temporal and spatial scales and levels of biological organization. We propose that the processes affecting understory birds in the Sarapiqui region may be broadly representative of threats experienced by rainforest understory birds pantropically. Effective conservation will require consideration of such diverse and interacting factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pechenik, Jan A.; Tyrell, Abigail S.								Larval diet alters larval growth rates and post-metamorphic performance in the marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata								MARINE BIOLOGY				162	8			1597	1610		10.1007/s00227-015-2696-7				AUG 2015	2015	Some larval experiences can produce "latent effects" on post-metamorphic growth or survival. While it is known that periods of starvation during larval development can cause such latent effects, the effect of larval diet on post-metamorphic growth has not been studied. As global climate change and ocean acidification are expected to decrease phytoplankton concentrations and alter both phytoplankton species composition and nutritional characteristics, we examined the impact of 3 phytoplankton species (Isochrysis galbana, clone T-ISO; Pavlova lutheri, clone MONO; and Dunaliella tertiolecta, clone DUN) on larval growth and subsequent post-metamorphic fitness in the slippersnail Crepidula fornicata. Once larvae metamorphosed, the juveniles were all reared on the diet that produced the fastest growth, T-ISO, to look for latent effects of larval diet on juvenile growth. In all experiments, larvae grew most quickly on T-ISO; diet did not affect relative rates of shell and tissue growth. In 2 of the 4 experiments conducted on the effects of diet quality, larvae reared on T-ISO metamorphosed into juveniles that grew significantly faster than those that had been raised on the other phytoplankton species, indicating clear latent effects of dietary experience and suggesting parent-related genetic variation in susceptibility to this type of stress. Rearing larvae at a very low food concentration of T-ISO (1 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) until metamorphosis also produced severe latent effects on juvenile growth, reducing juvenile growth rates by more than 30 %. These data provide yet another example of how stresses experienced during larval development can influence post-metamorphic performance, and add another level of complexity to attempts at predicting the future consequences of environmental change on marine community structure and species interactions.									16	0	0	0	16	1	17			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000359384600008

However, multi-proxy paleoecological approaches may offer such opportunities, especially in the study of remote island lakes characterized by being species poor and buffered somewhat against the recent climate change. We used a paleoecological multi-proxy approach to determine the relative importance of nutrient loading, meteorological forcing, and fish species introduction for recent lake ecosystem development in Lake Furnas on the island of Sao Miguel, the Azores. The lake was stocked with cyprinids in the late nineteenth century and recently also with piscivorous fish, and has been affected by increasing agricultural activities in its catchment. We analyzed marker pigments, cladoceran remains, and subfossil diatoms in a 46-cm core representing the last 40 years. Remains of large-bodied cladocerans were virtually absent until the introductions of piscivorous pike and pikeperch in 1980 and 1982, respectively, after which the zooplankton community composition changed abruptly. First Ceriodaphnia sp. appeared (ca. 1980), followed by Daphnia a few years later. Carotenoids from cyanobacteria (myxoxanthophyll, aphanizophyll) were regularly present in the lake sediment with a major shift occurring around 1994, from N-2-fixing to non-fixing groups. This shift coincided with the onset of anoxia in the lake water, evidenced by the presence of pigments from Chlorobiaceae (BChl-e homologues and isorenieratene), and with a rapid decrease in benthic-tychoplanktonic diatoms and an increase in cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, dinoflagellates, and cryptophytes. The composition of microbial and algal assemblages changed rapidly after Daphnia appearance, and the covariance between fish stocking, nutrient loading, and enhanced temperatures captured most of the variability in algae accumulation, and thus likely in lake primary production as well. Thus, lake production apparently did not respond strongly to specific changes in temperature, food-web structure, or nutrient input, but rather to the combined effects of all the three forcing mechanisms, emphasizing the role of multi-stressors in lake ecosystem functioning. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of these remote species-poor lakes to increased nutrient loading, introduction of non-native species, such as fish and climate change.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000290492700009

Typhlodromus athenas Swirski and Ragusa is an indigenous mite in the Mediterranean region and data on its temperature dependent development are lacking. In the current study, temperature-dependent development and survival of T. athenas immature stages were evaluated on eggs and all stages of Tetranychus urticae Koch, as well as on almond (Prunus amygdalis Batsch) pollen, under seven constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 degrees C, 65% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. On both diets survival was considerably high at all temperatures. The longest developmental period of immature stages was recorded at 15 degrees C, whereas the shortest was at 30 degrees C. Female immatures on almond pollen had shorter developmental time compared to that on twospotted spider mites. Food had a significant effect on female total developmental time at temperatures lower than 25 degrees C. The lower developmental thresholds, estimated by a linear model, for egg-to-adult of females and males fed on pollen were 8.60 and 8.77 degrees C, respectively, whereas on T. urticae they were 10.15 and 10.62 degrees C, respectively. Higher values of t(min) for total development were estimated by a nonlinear model (Lactin-2), and ranged from 10.21 degrees C for both females and males on almond, to 11.07 for females and 10.78 degrees C for males on prey. Moreover, this model estimated optimal and lethal temperatures accurately. The results of this study indicate that T. athenas appears better adapted to higher temperatures that occur in the Mediterranean region and may be a useful biological control agent.									5	0	0	0	6	0	6			0046-225X			WOS:000298714300031	22217776

In Belize, Central America, prop roots growing below LLW are colonized by diverse assemblages of organisms, including macroalgae, hydrozoans, ascidians, sponges, anemones, hard corals, and isopod crustaceans. Mangroves, root-fouling epibionts, root herbivores, and benthic predators engage in complex interactions that are major determinants of mangrove growth and production. Species richness of root epibionts increases with distance from the mainland and with proximity to the barrier reef. Species richness decreases with variability in water temperature and salinity. Ascidians and sponges transplanted from Lark Cay into the coastal Placencia Lagoon failed to survive, but anemones from Lark Cay survived in Placencia Lagoon. Reciprocal transplants survived off-shore. The gastropod predator, Melongena melongena L., present only in mainland estuaries, reduced local barnacle abundance and epibiont species richness in Placencia Lagoon. Isopod species richness also increases with distance from shore, but the number of roots bored by these species decreases. These isopods can reduce root relative growth rate (RGR(root)) by 55%. On off-shore cays, sponges and ascidians ameliorate negative effects of isopods. In mainland estuaries where epibionts are less common, isopod damage to roots is more severe. Experimental studies in mangrove swamps throughout the world would clarify the importance of plant-animal interactions in these widespread tropical ecosystems.

Nearly all the mysids were found in the upper portions of the kelp canopy. Relative abundance, size, and male/female/juvenile frequency of occurrence varied substantially throughout the 2-year study. Abundance, ranging monthly from 254-3,359 individuals per 300-l sample, correlated with sea-water temperature the first year, but not the second. Laboratory growth rate, determined by measuring carapace length, was approximately linear for the first 37 days after hatching(16 mu m day(-1)), after which it increased and became more variable until sexual maturity was reached at 62 days (females 41 mu m day(-1), males 35 mu m day(-1)). Brooding females were collected thoughout 1 year, but highest fecundities (maximum 45 juveniles in 1 female) occurred between May and August. Mean field fecundities (27.4 +/- 6.6 juveniles per female) were higher than those of laboratory-reared females (16.4 +/- 4.3). These results indicate that there is high year-round production of these mysids, with peak production in summer when predation by recruiting rockfishes would be most intense.									14	0	0	0	13	0	15			0278-0372			WOS:A1994PQ67800004

A critical input parameter for such models is an estimate of the consumption rates and biomasses of prey consumed by fish populations. Here we estimate the annual prey consumption of an abundant coastal piscivore, Arripis trutta, which may exert substantial top-down control on its prey over its broad latitudinal range (28-43 degrees S) in the coastal waters off south-eastern (SE) Australia. Three independent techniques were used to estimate annual prey consumption at two environmentally-relevant temperatures, 15 and 20 degrees C: experimental gastric evacuation experiments (coupled with stomach content analyses); bioenergetics modelling, and; empirical regression modelling. Each technique yielded a similar range of estimates with annual food consumed/biomass (Q/B) ranging from 3.20 to 4.02 at 15 degrees C and 4.23 to 5.25 at 20 degrees C. Using an estimated A. trutta stock biomass in SE Australia of 10,000 t, total mean annual prey consumption was estimated to be 42,200 t, consisting primarily (93%) of small zooplanktivorous teleosts, particularly Australian sardines Sardinops sagax (35%) and scads Trachurus spp. (30%). These results indicate that A. trutta do possess a top-down influence on the pelagic ecosystem of coastal SE Australia via consumption of considerable biomasses of small pelagic fish. However, despite the use of a maximum regional estimate of A. trutta abundance and the presence of at least two other ecologically similar predatory fish species with higher annual prey consumption rates in SE Australian coastal waters, A. trutta may remove only a small proportion (similar to 15%) of the estimated spawning biomasses of its major prey species in this region annually. The multiple-technique approach used in this study has for the first time quantified the diet of A. trutta in SE Australia and provided broad and repeatable estimates of its annual prey consumption for use in ecosystem models designed to manage coastal fisheries resources in this region.

As prey, the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium sp. (both ca. 15 m cell diameter) were used at a range of carbon concentrations similar to the ones experienced in nature (6.4 to 393.8 C L-1). Ingestion rates increased linearly with food concentration and did not differ between prey types. When comparing the effect of temperature, highest clearance and ingestion rates were obtained at 19C, whereas no difference was observed among the other temperatures. Daily rations varied between 1.2 and 183.5 body carbon day(1). Additional experiments were conducted to study the selective feeding behaviour of C. chierchiae when offered a mixture of different prey types. Selective feeding was dependent on food concentration; at low food levels, large cells were selected (Ditylum brightwellii), whereas at medium and high food concentrations no clear selection patterns were observed. In contrast to other studies, no positive selection of dinoflagellates over other algal food was found.									14	1	0	0	12	0	14			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000321068100011

The invasion ecology and, in particular, the population dynamics of the species in this country are, however, poorly understood. In this study the relative abundance and population dynamics of G. affinis were quantified in 5 interconnected irrigation impoundments within the Sundays River Valley, Eastern Cape. Four fish surveys were conducted from early summer (February 2012) to early winter (June 2012). Repeated-measures ANOVA analyses on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of G. affinis between sampling events and dams revealed significant differences in population dynamics among dams, although an overall trend of rapid increase followed by plateau in summer, with a rapid decline in winter was seen in most dams. A general linear model assessing the role of biotic and abiotic factors on G. affinis CPUE found that water temperature and the presence of the native fish Glossogobius callidus had significant effects on the CPUE of G. affinis. While winter drops in temperature are likely to have caused mortality in G. affinis populations, and may act as the primary regulator of G. affinis establishment success in South African impoundments, the negative effect of G. callidus densities on G. affinis suggests competitive or predator-prey interactions with the native species.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1816-7950			SCIELO:S1816-79502013000400005		
J	Salt, Jason L.; Bulit, Celia; Zhang, Wei; Qi, Hongli; Montagnes, David J. S.								Spatial extinction or persistence: landscape-temperature interactions perturb predator-prey dynamics								ECOGRAPHY				40	10			1177	1186		10.1111/ecog.02378				OCT 2017	2017	Recognising that species interact across a range of spatial scales, we explore how landscape structure interacts with temperature to influence persistence. Specifically, we recognise that few studies indicate thermal shifts as the proximal cause of species extinctions; rather, species interactions exacerbated by temperature result in extinctions. Using microcosm-based experiments, as models of larger landscape processes, we test hypotheses that would be problematic to address through field work. A text-book predator-prey system (the ciliates Didinium and Paramecium) was used to compare three landscapes: an unfragmented landscape subjected to uniform temperatures (10, 20, 30 degrees C); a fragmented landscape (potentially hosting metapopulations) subjected to these three temperatures; and a fragmented landscape subjected to a spatial temperature gradient (-10 to 30 degrees C) - despite the prevalence of natural temperature ecoclines this is the first time such an analysis has been conducted. Initial thermal response-analysis (growth, mortality, and movement measured between 10 and 30 degrees C) suggested that as temperature increased, the predator might drive the prey to extinction. Thermal preferences (measured at 5 temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees C), indicated that both predator and prey preferred warmer temperatures, with the predator exhibiting the stronger preference, suggesting that cooler regions might act as a prey-refuge. The landscape level observations, however, did not entirely support the predictions. First, in the unfragmented landscape, increased temperature led to extinctions, but at the highest temperature (where the predator growth can be reduced) the prey survived. Second, at high temperatures the fragmented landscape failed to host metapopulations that would allow predator-prey persistence. Third, the thermal ecocline did not provide heterogeneity that improved stability; rather it forced both species to occupy a smaller realized space, leading toward extinctions. These findings reveal that temperature-impacted rates and temperature preferences combine to drive predator-prey dynamics and persistence across landscapes.									2	1	0	0	3	0	3			0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:000411825200004

Density-dependent growth, size structure, and condition were not evident in the northern pike populations sampled. Relative abundance of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides was positively related to size structure of yellow perch Perca flavescens and bluegills Lepomis macrochirus when northen pike were absent. When northern pike and largemouth bass populations were sympatric, these relationships were less evident. Population size structure of yellow perch was lower in lakes with northern pike, but decreased size structure was not evident for bluegills. Northern pike growth decreased with July bottom water temperature, which ranged from 20degreesC to 25degreesC. Recruitment patterns of northern pike in the Sandhill lakes appeared to be lake-specific, strong and weak year-classes occurring in the same year among different populations. Northern pike in these shallow, warm lakes act as a top-down predator and appear to structure fish communities predominated by largemouth bass and panfish. Biologists managing warmwater Midwestern lakes thus should consider the effect of northern pike on fish communities.									30	0	0	0	30	0	32			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000181587400031

To better discriminate and understand the intrinsic and environmental correlates of changing aquatic ecosystems, we untangle in present study how the effects of a low-dosed fungicide on daphnids (via different exposure routes) becomes modified by increasing temperature and the presence of a predator.Using a fractional multifactorial test design, the individual growth, reproduction and population growth rate of Daphnia pulex were investigated under exposure to the fungicide pyrimethanil at an environmental relevant concentration - either directly (via the water phase), indirectly (via food), dually (via water and food) or for multiple generations (fungicide treated source population) - at three temperatures and in presence/absence of the predator kairomones of Chaoborus flavicans.Our results clearly illustrate that multiple stress factors can modify the response of an aquatic key species to pollutants. The environmentally relevant exposure of the contaminant via food or the medium is of same importance. Nevertheless, temperature and the presence of a predator are the dominant factors controlling the reproduction of D. pulex. We conclude that sublethal pyrimethanil pollution can disturb the zooplankton community at suboptimal temperature conditions, but the effects will become masked by low temperatures or if chaoborid larvae are present.

Earning their Stripes: The Potential of Tiger Trout and Other Salmonids as Biological Controls of Forage Fishes in a Western Reservoir								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				37	2			380	394		10.1080/02755947.2016.1264509				2017	2017	Maintaining a balance between predator and prey populations can be an ongoing challenge for fisheries managers, especially in managing artificial ecosystems such as reservoirs. In a high-elevation Utah reservoir, the unintentional introduction of the Utah Chub Gila atraria and its subsequent population expansion prompted managers to experimentally shift from exclusively stocking Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to also stocking tiger trout (female Brown Trout Salmo trutta x male Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis) and Bonneville Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii utah (hereafter, Cutthroat Trout) as potential biological control agents. We measured a combination of diet, growth, temperature, and abundance and used bioenergetic simulations to quantify predator demand versus prey supply. Utah Chub were the predominant prey type for tiger trout, contributing up to 80% of the diet depending on the season. Utah Chub represented up to 70% of the total diet consumed by Cutthroat Trout. Although Utah Chub dominated the fish biomass in the reservoir, we still estimated abundances of 238,000 tiger trout, 214,000 Cutthroat Trout, and 55,000 Rainbow Trout. Consequently, when expanded to the population level of each predator, tiger trout and Cutthroat Trout consumed large quantities of Utah Chub on an annual basis: tiger trout consumed 508,000 kg (2,660 g/predator) of the standing prey population, and Cutthroat Trout consumed an estimated 322,000 kg (1,820 g/predator). The estimated combined consumption by Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout exceeded the estimate of Utah Chub annual production. As such, our results suggest that the high rates of piscivory exhibited by Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout in artificial lentic ecosystems are likely sufficient to effectively reduce the overall abundance of forage fishes and to prevent forage fishes from dominating fish assemblages. Collectively, this research provides the first documented findings on tiger trout ecology and performance, which will aid managers in designing and implementing the best stocking strategy to optimize sport fish performance, control undesirable forage fish, and enhance and maintain angler satisfaction.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000399562800013		
J	POLLOCK, DE								SPINY LOBSTERS AT TRISTAN-DA-CUNHA, SOUTH-ATLANTIC - INTER-ISLAND VARIATIONS IN GROWTH AND POPULATION-STRUCTURE								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE-SUID-AFRIKAANSE TYDSKRIF VIR SEEWETENSKAP				10				1	12						1991	1991	The spiny lobster Jasus tristani is exploited at the isolated volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible and Gough in the south central Atlantic Ocean. Tagging studies indicated consistent inter-island differences in lobster growth rates and size composition which were unrelated to fishing intensity. A combined diving/trapfishing survey was conducted during March/April 1989 to investigate possible reasons for observed differences in lobster growth, size composition and sizes at maturity at Nightingale and Inaccessible, two small islands just south of Tristan da Cunha. Differences in water temperature were not considered to be relevant owing to the two islands' proximity to each other. Although it was thought that food availability to the lobster stocks might be the underlying cause for the inter-island differences, an intensive diving survey failed to reveal any obvious differences in the benthic biota of the two islands. Predation by fish on small lobsters is intense at all islands, but at Inaccessible the topography of the shallow subtidal zone (where most puerulus larvae settle) affords more shelter to young lobsters than at Nightingale. Survival of juvenile lobsters is thus relatively enhanced, resulting in higher densities of recruiting lobsters at Inaccessible, a feature confirmed by diving as well as analysis of trap catch per unit effort and size composition. The observed inter-island differences in lobster population structure therefore appear to be caused by differences in density-dependent growth and survival of young lobsters. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to yield per recruit, egg production per recruit and the effects of minimum size regulations.									29	0	0	0	29	2	30			0257-7615			WOS:A1991GP22400001		
J	Glaser, Sarah M.								Interdecadal variability in predator-prey interactions of juvenile North Pacific albacore in the California Current System								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				414				209	221		10.3354/meps08723				2010	2010	Predator prey interactions are critical components of multispecies models, and most attempts to quantify these interactions in pelagic marine environments rely on observational diet studies. In conjunction with 3 historical studies, a new diet study quantifies decadal patterns of predator prey interactions for juvenile North Pacific albacore Thunnus alalunga in the California Current System (CCS). Juvenile albacore in the CCS eat young-of-year prey and derive 68 to 89% of nutrition from fishes, 9 to 30% from cephalopods, and the remainder from crustaceans. Despite resurgence in abundance of Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax in the CCS, only Northern anchovy Engraulls mordax, Pacific saury Cololabis saira, and cephalopods have consistently been important to albacore diet. These results support theoretical predictions of optimal foraging models that albacore will prefer hunting in cold, near-shore waters containing anchovy and saury while minimizing foraging in warmer, offshore waters of sardine habitat. A bioenergetics model is used to calculate daily and annual consumption rates. The importance of calculating an ensemble prey energy density (EDn) value for steady-state consumption models is demonstrated, and the relationship between EDn and consumption rates is generalized to other marine predators. Low variability in EDn consumed by juvenile albacore translates into equally stable consumption to biomass (Q:B) ratios over decades.									28	0	0	0	22	0	32			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000281891100017		
J	Crawford, RE; Jorgenson, JK								Quantitative studies of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) schools: Important energy stores in the Arctic food web								ARCTIC				49	2			181	193						JUN 1996	1996	Aggregations of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in Allen Bay, on the southern coast of Cornwallis Island, Lancaster Sound were studied with fishery acoustics techniques in 1989 and 1990. Nonschooling fish were also examined in several Cornwallis and Devon Island bays. Although acoustic signal shading within the schools minimized abundance estimates (error may exceed 50%), measurements in 1989 indicated that two aggregations of adult Arctic cod together comprised at least 900 million individuals. Combined surface area of these two schools was 59 hectares, and total biomass was 30 715 tonnes (520 t . ha(-1)). Mean density in one school was 91 fish . m(-3). In the other it was 307 fish . m(-3), each fish occupying a space equivalent to about one body length cubed. A smaller school studied in the same location a year later had a mean density of 72 fish . m(-3). Mean length of net-captured fish from that school was 18.7 cm (TL), and mean weight was 44.5 g. School surface area was about 4.6 hectares, and it contained an estimated 2835 t of biomass (616 t . ha(-1)). Given that significant concentrations of biomass occurred in this small portion of the Lancaster Sound region, we concluded that, in theory, sufficient biomass was sequestered in fish schools within the region to support energy flows through the food web. Acoustic measurements indicated that fish at a school edge were larger (target strength [TS] = -44.7 dB, equivalent size = 19.3 cm) than nonschooling fish elsewhere (TS = -53.4 dB, equivalent size = 8.4 cm). Zooplankton abundance near a school was markedly reduced. Near Cornwallis Island, where water temperatures throughout the water column were > -1.3 degrees C, fish were scattered from surface to bottom. But near Devon Island, fish were common only in warmer surface waters (> 2.0 degrees C) above a marked thermocline at about 35 m, but not deeper, where water temperature was -1.5 degrees C.									41	0	0	0	37	0	43			0004-0843			WOS:A1996UV54800008

Many mobile consumers living on the shore are immobile during low tide, and can be exposed to high temperatures on calm, warm days. Rising body temperatures can raise metabolic rates, induce stress responses, and potentially affect growth and survival, but the effects may differ among species with different microhabitat preferences. We measured aerial and aquatic respiration rates of 4 species of Lottia limpets from central California, and estimated critical thermal maxima. In a variety of microhabitats in the field, we tracked body temperatures and measured limpet growth rates on experimental plates colonized by natural microalgae. Limpet species found higher on the shore had lower peak respiration rates during high temperature aerial exposure, and had higher critical thermal maxima. Using our long-term records of field body temperatures, we estimated cumulative respiration to be 5 to 14% higher in warm microhabitats. Growth rates in the field appear to be driven by an interaction between available microalgal food resources, low tide temperature, and limpet species identity, with limpets from warmer micro habitats responding positively to higher food availability and higher low tide temperatures. Stressful conditions in warm microhabitats make up a small portion of the total lifetime of these limpets, but the greater proportion of time spent at non-stressful, but warm, body temperatures may result in enhanced growth compared to limpets living in cooler microhabitats.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000350667800009

This review synthesizes existing knowledge on its biology and interactions with other organisms, including its host plant and the viral pathogens it vectors.2 Information about trophic interactions with other insect herbivores and natural enemies is reviewed. Vine weevils Otiorhynchus sulcatus compromise aphid resistance in some raspberry cultivars, increasing A. idaei abundance by 80%. Parasitoids show mixed success in parasitizing A. idaei, although Aphidius ervi attack rates more than doubled when A. idaei fed on a partially susceptible raspberry cultivar, compared with a resistant variety. These findings are discussed in the context of potential biological control as part of an integrated pest and disease management framework.3 Amphorophora idaei transmits four known viruses: Black raspberry necrosis virus, Raspberry leaf mottle virus, Raspberry leaf spot virus and Rubus yellow net virus, with A. idaei taking as little as 2 min to transmit some viruses.4 Existing control strategies, including resistant cultivars, insecticides and eradication of disease from parent plants, are described. In particular, strong selection pressures have resulted in A. idaei overcoming genetic resistance in many raspberry cultivars and most insecticides are now ineffective.5 Future directions for the sustained control of A.idaei are suggested, taking into consideration the possible effects of climate change and also changes in agronomic practices in U.K. agriculture.									29	0	0	0	27	0	30			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000262515300006

PREDPREY is a state-variable model that uses a distributed-delay function to represent temperature-dependent development of both predator and prey species. The predator submodel includes descriptions of immigration, predator search, functional response, survivorship, and reproductive characteristics. The prey submodel includes descriptions of immigration, survivorship, and reproductive characteristics. The plant model describes plant growth as a function of leaf area accumulation over time. The model tracks changes in predator and prey populations over a single growing season using a 1-day time step. The model captures the essence of predator-prey dynamics to provide reasonable predictions of population patterns. Comparison of the no-predator scenario to the standard simulation (1000 predators/ha) indicates that predators bring about a 24% reduction in peak prey (larval) density and a 47% reduction in overwintering prey (adult) numbers. Sensitivity analyses indicate that reproductive and survivorship characteristics of the prey have a relatively large impact on pest density. Among predator characteristics, developmental rate and most reproductive parameters have a greater impact than do search parameters and survivorship. Plant growth rate has a greater impact than the initial size of plants. The model can be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness of natural enemies, investigate augmentative biological control strategies, and evaluate biological control strategies as part of larger IPM programs.

The distribution and abundance patterns, diet and growth of T. luscus were studied based on samples collected on seven occasions from November 2000 to March 2002 using a 12 m otter-trawl with 18 mm mesh size at 12 sites within the estuary and six sites in the adjacent coastal areas. This species occurred only in the coastal areas adjacent to the estuary and a marked seasonal pattern was reported, which reflected the peak abundance of juveniles that use this area as a nursery ground. No marked relationships were obtained between T. luscus abundance and the environmental variables considered. Nonetheless, the highest densities of pouting were recorded at sites where water temperature was high compared with the other sampling areas. Diet of T. luscus juveniles was mainly composed of crustaceans Decapoda, Mysidacea and Amphipoda. The growth rate determined for T. luscus juveniles off the Portuguese coast was higher than those reported for North European areas, and was similar to those obtained in the eastern Mediterranean.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000220464600004

The imminent increase in ocean pCO(2) is predicted to have negative consequences for marine fishes, including reduced aerobic performance, but variability among species could be expected. Understanding interspecific responses to ocean acidification is important for predicting the consequences of ocean acidification on communities and ecosystems. In the present study, the effects of exposure to near-future seawater CO2 (860 mu atm) on resting ((M) over dotO(2rest)) and maximum ((M) over dotO(2max)) oxygen consumption rates were determined for three tropical coral reef fish species interlinked through predator-prey relationships: juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis and Pomacentrus amboinensis, and one of their predators: adult Pseudochromis fuscus. Contrary to predictions, one of the prey species, P. amboinensis, displayed a 28-39% increase in (M) over dotO(2max) after both an acute and four-day exposure to near-future CO2 seawater, while maintaining (M) over dotO(2rest). By contrast, the same treatment had no significant effects on (M) over dotO(2rest) or (M) over dotO(2max) of the other two species. However, acute exposure of P. amboinensis to 1400 and 2400 mu atm CO2 resulted in (M) over dotO(2max) returning to control values. Overall, the findings suggest that: (1) the metabolic costs of living in a near-future CO2 seawater environment were insignificant for the species examined at rest; (2) the (M) over dotO(2max) response of tropical reef species to near-future CO2 seawater can be dependent on the severity of external hypercapnia; and (3) near-future ocean pCO(2) may not be detrimental to aerobic scope of all fish species and it may even augment aerobic scope of some species. The present results also highlight that close phylogenetic relatedness and living in the same environment, does not necessarily imply similar physiological responses to near-future CO2.

This study measured in situ zooplankton grazing rate on Microcystis via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) amplification of prey DNA from the guts of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, an abundant and important prey species for endangered fish in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We calibrated the qPCR assay in laboratory grazing experiments with Eurytemora affinis, a similar sized copepod abundant in the SFE during winter, due to higher ingestion of Microcystis by this copepod compared to Pseudodiaptomus forbesi. In the field, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi ingested Microcystis during blooms, including strains capable of producing microcystin toxins. Although the Microcystis content in Pseudodiaptomus forbesi guts increased with bloom intensity, estimated ingestion rates were low and suggested copepods avoided this cyanobacterium. Moreover, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi abundance was inversely related to its gut Microcystis content, but not related to other factors including temperature, salinity, turbidity, and gut fluorescence of chlorophyll a. Results demonstrate that the gut Microcystis content of zooplankton may be a key factor explaining their abundance in nature. Our results also highlight the utility of molecular methods for understanding in situ trophic interactions in bloom-dominated waters. Increased blooms under future climate scenarios (e.g., extreme drought and higher temperatures) may decrease the abundance of key zooplankton like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi through increased ingestion of Microcystis, with potentially negative effects on endangered fishes in the SFE.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000450233300007

The intertidal snail Nucella ostrina risks aerial exposure at low tide to feed on the barnacle Balanus glandula. We hypothesized that N. ostrina foraging behavior would be constrained by duration and timing of low tide exposure. We added snails to intertidal blocks on San Juan Island, Washington, USA, and forced them to choose between barnacles placed on the western or eastern face of each block, or to shelter and forgo foraging. Snail behavior and barnacle mortality were monitored daily for 8 wk during summer 2011. N. ostrina foraging peaked every 2 wk, when temperature was minimized by tidal cycling. Low tide timing determined which substrate orientation was coolest and coincided with the proportion of snails foraging on one substrate face or the other: snails foraged on the western faces on days with morning low tides and on eastern faces on days with afternoon low tides. Barnacle consumption rates mirrored this spatiotemporal foraging pattern. Our conceptual model predicted mobile organism presence and location: snails foraged during the days of the tidal cycle least likely to be hot and selected the coolest available surface when foraging. These results suggest that N. ostrina alters foraging behavior to minimize risk of exposure to high temperatures or other emersion stresses. Consequently, predation on barnacles varies over space and time. This spatiotemporal behavior may buffer warming air temperatures and should be considered in models of coastal population and community dynamics.									19	1	0	0	18	0	19			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000347720100012

We performed a quantitative analysis of the response at the level of total biomass and size classes and a semi-quantitative one at the level of individual taxa. Total biomass of HF was significantly lower under higher temperatures while there was no significant effect of CO2. The mean biomass of the picoflagellates did not respond to temperature while the three nanoflagellate size classes (class limits 3, 5, 8, 15 mu m) responded negatively to warming while not responding to CO2. The taxon-level results indicate that heterotrophic flagellates do not form a homogenous trophic guild, as often assumed in pelagic food web studies. Instead, the heterotrophic flagellates formed a "food web within the food web". There was a pronounced succession of flagellates leading from a dominance of bacterivores and colloidal matter feeders before the phytoplankton bloom to omnivorous feeders preying upon phytoplankton and heterotrophic flagellates during and after the bloom. This complex intraguild predation patterns probably dampened the response to experimental treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Lister, Bradford C.; Garcia, Andres								Climate-driven declines in arthropod abundance restructure a rainforest food web								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				115	44			E10397	E10406		10.1073/pnas.1722477115				OCT 30 2018	2018	A number of studies indicate that tropical arthropods should be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 degrees C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Nino/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.									158	0	0	0	128	0	160			0027-8424			WOS:000448713200013	30322922

One such species, the mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus), is declining, but better information on their natural history and development of more effective population monitoring techniques is needed. We assessed seasonal variation in capture success, biases in capture techniques, and feeding ecology of mudpuppies in Wolf Lake, a highly perturbed and urban former estuarine wetland complex to Lake Michigan. Trapping periods of >= 3 consecutive nights occurred from January to May 2015, and October 2015 to March 2016. Overall trapping success differed among trapping periods (p = 0.01) and declined precipitously at water temperatures above 14.1 degrees C (p < 0.001). Mudpuppies in traps (mean 26.9 +/- 0.5 cm) were larger than those caught with hand nets (mean 14.7 +/- 0.8 cm, p < 0.0001), suggesting that multiple methods may be needed to accurately assess demographics. Stomach contents obtained through gastric lavage included mollusks, leeches, insects, isopods, amphipods, crayfish, fish, a frog, and a juvenile conspecific. Invasive species, including rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), and zebra/quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) were present in guts, suggesting mudpuppy foraging has changed along with aquatic communities in the region. Prey community analyses revealed differences in overall diet among size classes of mudpuppies (p = 0.001), but relatively weak similarity within size classes. Results suggest that mudpuppies in lake ecosystems occupy a broad niche that changes as they grow. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Determining when and where the biomass and activity of heterotrophic prokaryotes are controlled by resource availability (bottom-up), predation and viral lysis (top-down) or temperature will help in future carbon cycling predictions. We conducted an extensive survey across subtropical and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Global Circumnavigation Expedition and assessed indices for these three types of controls at 109 stations (mostly from the surface to 4,000 m depth). Temperature control was approached by the apparent activation energy in eV (ranging from 0.46 to 3.41), bottom-up control by the slope of the log-log relationship between biomass and production rate (ranging from -0.12 to 1.09) and top-down control by an index that considers the relative abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and viruses (ranging from 0.82 to 4.83). We conclude that temperature becomes dominant (i.e. activation energy >1.5 eV) within a narrow window of intermediate values of bottom-up (0.3-0.6) and top-down 0.8-1.2) controls. A pervasive latitudinal pattern of decreasing temperature regulation towards the Equator, regardless of the oceanic basin, suggests that the impact of global warming on marine microbes and their biogeochemical function will be more intense at higher latitudes. Our analysis predicts that 1 degrees C ocean warming will result in increased biomass of heterotrophic prokaryoplankton only in waters with <26 degrees C of mean annual surface temperature.									20	1	0	0	20	0	21			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000406812100042	28423463

Flatworms were collected from the pelagic of a subtropical lake in Brazil. Growth was more rapid at higher temperatures: more prey were consumed, and more eggs produced. M. craci and particularly M. ehrenbergii fitted a linear mixed-effects model and showed a type II functional response. M. craci was the more stenothermic of the two. Intrageneric predation also occurred: M. ehrenbergii fed on M. craci, but not vice versa. After a first clutch of subitaneous eggs, M. ehrenbergii produced resting eggs only. In M. craci an intermediate type of eggs hatched some time after release, survived passage through the gut of M. ehrenbergii, but did not resist drying. By primarily selecting cladoceran prey, M. ehrenbergii can make coexistence of both flatworms possible. As population density of M. ehrenbergii increases, it turns to producing resting and non-viable subitaneous eggs, thus limiting its population size. In nature, these processes structure the zooplankton community, while avoiding extinction of prey and predator.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000427446400037	29538395

Except for smelt, the size of the spawning stock and the abundance of larvae were not related. Both the timing of appearance of larvae and their growth rate were determined by water temperature as was shown by a growth model developed earlier for Tjeukemeer fishes. In cyprinids and percids the survival of the larvae was hypothesized to be negatively related to the duration of the earliest stages. Except in cyprinids, the abundance of 0+ juvenile fish could be explained by the number of larvae. In cyprinids 0+ juvenile abundance at the end of the year was not related to the number of larvae in May and June. The cyprinid juvenile survival rates are hypothesized to be related to the size of the main cyprinid predator, 0+ pikeperch.									30	0	0	0	27	0	30			0378-1909			WOS:A1996UV98000006

Laboratory estimates of salmonine egg predation by round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), sculpins (Cottus cognatus and C-bairdi), and crayfish (Orconectes propinquus)								JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH				32	2			227	241		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[227:LEOSEP]2.0.CO;2				2006	2006	The continued lack of natural reproduction by lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in the Great Lakes has prompted development of models focused on the potential negative effects of interstitial predators. To aid in parameterization of such models we investigated the effect of temperature (1-2 degrees C, 4-5 degrees C, 7-8 degrees C, and 10-11 degrees C), predator group sze, interspecific competition, egg density (60-600 eggs bairdii) sculpins, round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), and the native crayfish (Oronectes propinquus) in the laboratory. Egg consumption by the sculpins and round goby all increased over the range of temperatures investigated (ca 0.5 eggs(.)day(-1) at 1-2 degrees C to 1.5 eggs(.)day-1 at 10-11 degrees C). Predator group size affected consumption: fewer eggs were eaten per individual slimy sculpin and round goby at densities of 5 or 10 per tanks than 1 individual per tank. There was no effect of interspecific competition on egg consumption by slimy sculpins and round gobies at a density of 10 individuals per tank for various species combinations (10:0, 9:1, 5:5, 1:9, 0:10). A type II functional response to egg density was observed for sculpies, gobies, and crayfish although at extreme densities per capita consumption by crayfish and gobies declined. The presence of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) did not affect the number of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs eaten by round gobies whose mussel consumption averaged 75% BW(.)day(-1). Of the four species examined, round gobies appeared to the most effective egg predator while crayfish were the least.									41	0	0	0	40	0	42			0380-1330			WOS:000239185200004

The proposed individual-based model (IBM) allows each life-stage, or group of stages, to be represented and considers the differences in development rates and mortality caused by temperature and predation. The biological functions of the model were selected and calibrated to ensure realistic development at the temperatures recorded in the Seine estuary. The effect of temperature on development time and clutch size (CS) were obtained indirectly by fitting equations to the durations of stages observed in the laboratory at various temperatures and to CSs observed in the field. The degree-day approach was used to consider temperature variations. Mortality from predation was parameterized using the observed abundance of key predators. The proposed model successfully reproduces the life-history timing of the E. affinis population observed in the Seine estuary. The IBM approach was also used to simulate the development of the E. affinis population over several years at various temperatures with unlimited food conditions and no density dependence. The results confirm that the proposed model captures the role of temperature and predation in driving the seasonal population dynamics of E. affinis in the Seine estuary. This tool could be applied to any other egg-bearing copepods or could be used to test various E. affinis development scenarios in estuaries. This study also provides examples showing increasing temperatures and predation pressure shifts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hines, AH; Ruiz, GM								Temporal variation in juvenile blue crab mortality: Nearshore shallows and cannibalism in Chesapeake Bay								BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE				57	3			884	901						NOV 1995	1995	Adult abundance is determined by both recruitment and survival of juveniles. Blue crabs exhibit a distinct population size-structure reflecting seasonal cycles of recruitment and growth in the Rhode River, a subestuary lacking submerged vegetation in central Chesapeake Bay. Seasonally shifting modes in the size-structure, corresponding to juvenile, prepubertal and mature crabs, allowed trawl catches to be partitioned into 0+ and 1+ year classes of the crabs' 2-3 year life span. Fluctuations in the annual abundance of the year classes during 1988-1993 indicated that abundance of 0+ juveniles was not a good predictor of 1+ year-class abundance. We used tethering techniques to assess sources of, and temporal variation in, juvenile blue crab mortality as a function of water depth in the nearshore shallows of the subestuary. Laboratory experiments and analysis of remains of crabs tethered in the field indicated that cannibalism by large blue crabs was the source of 75-97% of mortality of juveniles. Crabs 30-50 mm CW suffered significantly higher mortality than 50-70 mm crabs. Mortality of tethered juveniles was significantly lower in shallow (15 cm) than deep (>70 cm) water. Mortality rates did not differ between day and night periods. Mortality of tethered juvenile blue crabs was high (40-90% per day) and exhibited significant seasonal and annual variation from 1989-1993; and water depth showed significant interaction effects with these components of temporal variability. Multiple regression analysis indicated that water temperature, abundance of 1+ year-class crabs in deep-water trawls, and abundance of 0+ year-class crabs in nearshore seines accounted for 82% of the annual variation in mortality of juveniles tethered at medium (40 cm) depth. Together, these results emphasize the importance of the nearshore shallows and body size as a crucial refuges for juvenile blue crabs encountering intense, but temporally variable cannibalism by large crabs. Juvenile mortality may be an important variable regulating population dynamics of blue crabs.

In the presence of zooplanktivorous fish, more than 80 % of C. hirundinella cells had an hypotheca with two horns. In the enclosures without fish, we observed a highly significant increase in the proportion of C. hirundinella with three antapical horns. The proportion of C. hirundinella cells with three antapical horns tended to increase with nutrient loading, but this effect was not significant and no significant interaction effect between nutrients and fish was observed. Temperature profiles were similar in fish and fishless enclosures and could not explain the morphological variability of C. hirundinella. Our results show that biotic factors should be taken into account in polymorphism studies on Ceratium. Frequently invoked hypotheses based only on water temperature, nutrient availability or turbulence level, may not be sufficient to explain this phenomenon.

The principal objective of this study was to determine in situ ingestion rates and assimilation efficiencies for seasonal hydromedusae populations in North Inlet, SC, USA. Hydromedusae collected during July 2005, 2006 and January 2006 were exposed to natural plankton communities that were previously radiolabeled with C-14. Ingestion rates and assimilation efficiencies were calculated from measurements of hydromedusae tissue radioactivity after ingestion and egestion, respectively. Net tows determined that the numerically dominant gelatinous predators in this system were Bougainvillia muscus (July 2005, 2006) and Nemopsis bachei (January 2006). Summer ingestion rates for B. muscus significantly increased with increased temperature, but there was no effect of temperature on winter ingestion rates for N. bachei, suggesting temperature responses are species specific. Moreover, there was a significant species effect on ingestion rates for July 2006. Hydromedusae assimilation efficiencies are relatively constant throughout the year and are not significantly affected by temperature, species, or season. Seasonal differences in grazing are likely a function of the pelagic community and temperature-dependent metabolism. These results coupled with seasonal hydromedusae abundance data imply summer populations of hydromedusae graze more heavily on prey than winter populations, while also assimilating more carbon into predator tissue. Effects of hydromedusae predation may include modification of trophic structure, shifts in algal community composition, and decline in ecosystem stability, leading to impacts on sustainable commercial fisheries.					41st European Marine Biology Symposium41st European Marine Biology Symposium	SEP 04-08, 2005SEP 04-08, 2005		Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool, Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, IRELANDUniv Coll Cork, Dept Zool, Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, IRELAND	8	0	0	0	9	0	10			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000254903400019		
J	Eliason, E. J.; Farrell, A. P.								Oxygen uptake in Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp.: when ecology and physiology meet								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				88	1	SI		359	388		10.1111/jfb.12790				JAN 2016	2016	Over the past several decades, a substantial amount of research has examined how cardiorespiratory physiology supports the diverse activities performed throughout the life cycle of Pacific salmon, genus Oncorhynchus. Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.									39	0	0	0	36	0	39			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000368943000018	26577675

We studied zooplankton-feeding little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel species of the Arctic, at their northernmost breeding site in Franz-Josef Land (80 degrees N), Russian Arctic. We tested the hypothesis that little auks still benefit from pristine arctic environmental conditions in this remote area. To this end, we analysed remote sensing data on sea-ice and coastal glacier dynamics collected in our study area across 1979-2013. Further, we recorded little auk foraging behaviour using miniature electronic tags attached to the birds in the summer of 2013, and compared it with similar data collected at three localities across the Atlantic Arctic. We also compared current and historical data on Franz-Josef Land little auk diet, morphometrics and chick growth curves. Our analyses reveal that summer sea-ice retreated markedly during the last decade, leaving the Franz-Josef Land archipelago virtually sea-ice free each summer since 2005. This had a profound impact on little auk foraging, which lost their sea-ice-associated prey. Concomitantly, large coastal glaciers retreated rapidly, releasing large volumes of melt water. Zooplankton is stunned by cold and osmotic shock at the boundary between glacier melt and coastal waters, creating new foraging hotspots for little auks. Birds therefore switched from foraging at distant ice-edge localities, to highly profitable feeding at glacier melt-water fronts within <5km of their breeding site. Through this behavioural plasticity, little auks maintained their chick growth rates, but showed a 4% decrease in adult body mass. Our study demonstrates that arctic cryosphere changes may have antagonistic ecological consequences on coastal trophic flow. Such nonlinear responses complicate modelling exercises of current and future polar ecosystem dynamics.									24	1	0	0	21	0	25			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000349896400010	25639886	
J	Bartholomew, A; Bohnsack, JA				Bartholomew, Aaron/ABB-8216-2020	Bartholomew, Aaron/0000-0003-3154-1515			A review of catch-and-release angling mortality with implications for no-take reserves								REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES				15	1-2			129	154		10.1007/s11160-005-2175-1				FEB 2005	2005	Management agencies have increasingly relied on size limits, daily bag or trip limits, quotas, and seasonal closures to manage fishing in recreational and commercial fisheries. Another trend is to establish aquatic protected areas, including no-take reserves (NTRs), to promote sustainable fisheries and protect aquatic ecosystems. Some anglers, assuming that no serious harm befalls the fish, advocate allowing catch-and-release (C&R) angling in aquatic protected areas. The ultimate success of these regulations and C&R angling depends on ensuring high release survival rates by minimizing injury and mortality. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of these practices, we review trends in C&R fishing and factors that influence release mortality. Analysis of Marine Recreational Fishery Statistic Survey (MRFSS) data for 1981 - 1999 showed no statistically significant U. S. trends for total number of anglers (mean 7.7 x 10(6)), total catch in numbers (mean 362 x 10(6)), or total annual catch/ angler (mean 42.6 fish). However, mean total annual landings declined 28% (188.5 to 135.7 x 10(6)), mean total catch/angler/trip declined 22.1% (0.95 to 0.74 fish), and mean landings/ angler/trip declined 27% (0.42 to 0.31 fish). The total number of recreational releases or discards increased 97.1% (98.0 to 193.2 x 10(6)) and as a proportion of total catch from 34.2% in 1981 to 58.0% in 1999. Evidence indicates that the increased releases and discards are primarily in response to mandatory regulations and to a lesser extent, voluntary releases. Total annual catch and mean annual catch/angler were maintained despite declines in catch per trip because anglers took 30.8% more fishing trips (43.5 to 56.9 x 10(6)), perhaps to compensate for greater use of bag and size limits. We reviewed 53 release mortality studies, doubling the number of estimates since Muoneke and Childress ( 1994) reviewed catch and release fishing. A meta-analysis of combined data (n = 274) showed a skewed distribution of release mortality ( median 11%, mean 18%, range 0 - 95%). Mortality distributions were similar for salmonids, marine, and freshwater species. Mean mortality varied greatly by species and within species, anatomical hooking location was the most important mortality factor. Other significant mortality factors were: use of natural bait, removing hooks from deeply hooked fish, use of J-hooks ( vs. circle hooks), deeper depth of capture, warm water temperatures, and extended playing and handling times. Barbed hooks had marginally higher mortality than barbless hooks. Based on numbers of estimates, no statistically significant overall effects were found for fish size, hook size, venting to deflate fish caught at depth, or use of treble vs. single hooks. Catch and release fishing is a growing and an increasingly important activity. The common occurrence of release mortality, however, requires careful evaluation for achieving fishery management goals and in some cases, disturbance, injury, or mortality may conflict with some goals of NTRs. Research is needed to develop better technology and techniques to reduce release mortality, to assess mortality from predation during capture and after release, to determine cumulative mortality from multiple hooking and release events, and to measure sub-lethal effects on behavior, physical condition, growth, and reproduction.									355	1	0	0	335	2	368			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000233725400008

This study evaluates the ability of habitat-based density models to accurately forecast cetacean abundance and distribution during a novel year with unprecedented warm ocean temperatures caused by a sustained marine heatwave. Location California Current Ecosystem, USA. Methods We constructed generalized additive models based on cetacean sighting and environmental data from 1991 to 2009 for eight species with a diverse range of habitat associations. Models were built with three different sets of predictor variables to compare performance. Models were then used to forecast species abundance and distribution patterns during 2014, a year with anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Cetacean sighting data collected during 2014 were used to assess model forecasts. Results Ratios of model-predicted abundance to observed abundance were close to 1:1 for all but one species and accurately captured changes in the number of animals in the study area during the anomalous year. Predicted distribution patterns also showed good concordance with the 2014 survey observations. Our results indicate that habitat relationships were captured sufficiently to predict both changes in abundance and shifts in distribution when conditions warmed, for both cool- and warm-temperate species. Main conclusions Models built with multidecadal datasets were able to forecast abundance and distribution in a novel warm year for a diverse set of cetacean species.

J	Anderson, MT; Kiesecker, JM; Chivers, DP; Blaustein, AR								The direct and indirect effects of temperature on a predator-prey relationship								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE				79	10			1834	1841		10.1139/cjz-79-10-1834				OCT 2001	2001	Abiotic factors may directly influence community structure by influencing biotic interactions. In aquatic systems, where gape-limited predators are common, abiotic factors that influence organisms' growth rates potentially mediate predator-prey interactions indirectly through effects on prey size. We tested the hypothesis that temperature influences interactions between aquatic size-limited insect predators (Notonecta kirbyi) and their larval anuran prey (Hyla regilla) beyond its indirect effect on prey size. Notonecta kirbyi and H. regilla were raised and tested in predator-prey trials at one of three experimentally maintained temperatures, 9.9, 20.7, or 25.7 degreesC. Temperature strongly influenced anuran growth and predator success; mean tadpole mass over time was positively related to temperature, while the number of prey caught was negatively related. At higher temperatures tadpoles attained greater mass more quickly, allowing them to avoid capture by notonectids. However, the probability of capture is a function of both mass and temperature; temperature was a significant explanatory variable in a logistic regression equation predicting prey capture. For a given prey mass, tadpoles raised in warmer water experienced a higher probability of capture by notonectids. Thus, rather than being static, prey size refugia are influenced directly by abiotic factors, in this case temperature. This suggests that temperature exerts differential effects on notonectid and larval anurans, leading to differences in the probability of prey capture for a given prey mass. Therefore, temperature can influence predator-prey interactions via indirect effects on prey size and direct effects on prey.									41	0	0	0	41	0	44			0008-4301			WOS:000172265900011		
J	Wong, Melisa C.; Peterson, Charles H.; Kay, Jenessa								Prey size selection and bottom type influence multiple predator effects in a crab-bivalve system								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				409				143	U158		10.3354/meps08621				2010	2010	Consumption by multiple conspecific or interspecific predators on shared prey is not always predicted when data from isolated predators are combined. Predator interactions can result in non-independent predator effects on prey, and may be influenced by prey size selection and bottom type. We examined stone crab Menippe mercenaria and blue crab Callinectes sapidus predation of hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria. Interactions between these predators may become common in mid-Atlantic estuaries as stone crab abundance increases with a poleward range shift driven by climate change. Crabs in isolation, in conspecific pairs and in the interspecific pair were offered clams in 5 size classes simultaneously (10-60 mm shell length [SL]) or 1 size class (10-20 mm SL). Trials were on sand and hard bottom. On sand, all predator pairs had independent effects on prey, regardless of the presence or absence of multiple prey sizes. On hard bottom, when multiple prey sizes were present, blue crab conspecific and the interspecific pairs consumed less than predicted from isolated crabs. Strong selection of small clams by blue crabs led to conspecific interactions that reduced foraging compared to isolated crabs. Because stone crabs consumed all clam sizes, behaviours other than prey size selection caused the non-independent effect on prey by the interspecific pair. When multiple prey sizes were absent on hard bottom, most predator pairs had independent effects on prey. Thus, an expected poleward range shift of stone crabs may not increase interactions with blue crabs when foraging on sand. However, on hard bottom, increased predator interactions could reduce overall predation risk for prey, especially when consuming multiple prey sizes. In a climate-changed mid-Atlantic estuary, stone crabs will consume a wide range of clam sizes, and the size refuge large clams usually have from blue crab predation will be lost.									28	0	0	0	27	0	28			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000279054000012

The maximum daily consumption rate was recorded at 30 degrees C and occurred during the oviposition period, when the females consumed an average of 169.40 specimens ofP. oleivoraand 24.58 ofE. orientalis. The maximum reproduction rate (4.20, and 3.84 eggs/female/day, onP. oleivoraandE. orientalis, respectively) was recorded at 30 degrees C and 50% RH, while the minimum one (1.20 and 0.86 eggs/female/day, onP. oleivoraandE. orientalis, respectively) was observed at 16 degrees C and 65% RH. It is demonstrated in the life-table parameters that when the predatory miteA. swirskiiis fed onP. oleivora, the highest reproduction rates (r(m) = 0.144, 0.195, 0.280, and 0.181 females/female/day) are obtained, while feeding onE. orientalisgave the lowest reproduction rates (r(m) = 0.121, 0.172, 0.204, and 0.141) at 16 degrees C and 65% RH, 23 degrees C and 60% RH, 30 degrees C and 55% RH, and 37 degrees C and 50% RH, respectively.

Here, we sample seabed communities from small polychaetes (<0.001 g) to large fish (> 1 kg) in the Celtic Sea and the western English Channel to examine how bottom trawling and primary production affect their size spectra and to compare these with predictions from a model that couples predator and detritivore communities. Size spectra were not well approximated by linear fits because of truncation of the size spectra of detritivores. Low primary production resulted in lower abundance of benthic fauna. Bottom trawling reduced the abundance of predators and large detritivores but allowed small detritivores to increase in abundance. These empirical size spectra were partly consistent with predictions from the size spectra model, showing that understanding the structuring of benthic communities requires a consideration of both size and functional group. The findings highlight the need for an ecosystem approach to understanding the effects of exploitation and climate change on marine ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000575801000005

Determining the thermal-sensitivity of this trophic interaction is, therefore, fundamental to predicting impacts of climate change. Here, we question the application of current predictive approaches. Thermal responses are commonly described by the Arrhenius function: r=Ae-EakT, where r is a rate (e.g., growth), A is a scaling factor, E-a is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann-constant, and T is absolute temperature. The influential metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) proposes that estimates of E-a for heterotrophs and autotrophs are 0.65 eV and 0.32 eV, respectively; when applied to specific growth rate of algae and protozoa, this difference has significant predictive consequences. Through literature review and statistical evaluation, we show that the MTE predictions do not apply to taxon-specific responses of protozoa (n = 103) or algae (n = 183), with mean E-a of 0.71 eV (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.74) and 0.61 eV (95% CI: 0.58-0.63), respectively. To obtain these, we fitted a series of models where E-a was constant within a defined group (e.g., protozoa), and the amplitude A depended on the individual responses within the group. Then, by applying the MTE and our predictions to a generic protozoan-algal, predator-prey model we show that: (1) the "canonical" MTE values lead to misrepresenting productivity by several fold; (2) a general response encompassing both groups (0.69 eV) should suffice for such models; and (3) applying our new responses has substantial effects on algal-protozoan population dynamics over temperature shifts of 5 degrees C.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000467593600021

Empirical allometric relationships were applied to develop size-dependent growth and mortality estimates. Estimated annual mean stock biomass of YOY bay anchovy was lowest in 1996 (17 x 10(3) metric tons [t] wet weight) and highest in 2000 (64 x 10(3) t). Estimated YOY production varied inter-annually by a factor of 4, ranging from 167 x 10(3) t in 1996 to 697 x 10(3) t in 2000. Daily stock biomass levels usually peaked in mid September, while daily production and contribution to predators peaked from mid July to late September. The annual production to mean biomass (P/(B) over bar) ratio, which included the very productive larval stage, was high and ranged from 9.02 to 13.23. Analysis of environmental factors indicated that water temperature and dissolved oxygen were important controllers of growth rate. Inter-annual variability in length-specific mortality was inversely related to mean salinity in the summer and fall, suggesting that salinity controls abundances and spatial distributions of predators on bay anchovy. Results imply that annually variable hydrological conditions and secondary productivity may drive observed variability in recruitment and production of YOY bay anchovy by inducing small but decisive differences in growth and predation mortality on early-life stages.									19	0	0	0	18	0	19			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000225543400018

For soil invertebrates in grassland ecosystems in the Netherlands, the site-specific slopes of the faunal biomass to organism body mass relationships reflected basic biochemical and biogeochemical processes associated with soil acidity and soil C:N:P stoichiometry. That is, the higher the phosphorus availability in the soil, the higher, on average, the slope of the faunal biomass size spectrum (i.e., the higher the biomass of large-bodied invertebrates relative to the biomass of small invertebrates). While other factors may also be involved, these results are consistent with the growth rate hypothesis from biological stoichiometry that relates phosphorus demands to ribosomal RNA and protein production. Thus our data represent the first time that ecosystem phosphorus availability has been associated with allometry in soil food webs ( supporting information available online). Our results have broad implications, as soil invertebrates of different size have different effects on soil processes.									121	14	0	0	108	1	133			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000270662000014

Baited traps have been used for many years to estimate the relative abundance of predators in the marine environment. However, traps may result in biased estimates due to inter- and intra-species variations in physiology and behaviour. The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of CPUE as a proxy for the relative abundance of Carcinus amends. Crab abundance estimates were obtained using underwater camera surveys. The study was conducted on commercial mussel beds in the Menai Strait, United Kingdom. CPUE data were obtained from the local C. maenas fishery operating over the mussel beds. The influence of temperature-dependent feeding rates on CPUE was predicted from the number of mussels consumed at different experimental temperatures in laboratory aquaria. Both CPUE and estimated abundance showed marked seasonal variation. Abundance maxima preceded temperature maxima by 2 mo. CPUE increased with temperature up to 15 C, while relative crab abundance based on visual surveys exhibited a strong positive correlation with day-length. CPUE appears not to be a suitable proxy for the relative abundance of C. maenas because of the effects of temperature on crab activity levels and thus catches.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0171-8630			WOS:000276021600014

These limitations are most obvious at the base of the food chain where there are large differences in the potential growth rates of the phytoplankton and zooplankton. Three of the examples are taken from a 40-year study of the impact of perch onDaphniain the North Basin of Windermere, one on the rates of change measured in an experimental enclosure and one from an 18-year study ofDaphniadynamics in Esthwaite Water. The Windermere examples show that the commercial perch fishery established in 1941 had little effect on the abundance ofDaphniabut the enrichment of the lake by war-time ploughing led to a short-lived increase in their reproductive rate. The other examples demonstrate that time plays an important part in all trophic interactions and shows that established patterns of phytoplankton succession are frequently disrupted by changes in the intensity of wind-induced mixing. The results are discussed in relation to recent reviews of the efficacy of biomanipulation and the challenges of analysing complex interactions in dynamic systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000562375300001		
J	Broomhall, SD								Egg temperature modifies predator avoidance and the effects of the insecticide endosulfan on tadpoles of an Australian frog								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				41	1			105	113		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2004.00883.x				FEB 2004	2004	1. Attention is shifting from simplistic explanations of global amphibian declines that posit a single cause (such as climate change, pesticide contamination or disease) to more complex scenarios that involve interactive effects. Temperature is a pervasive influence on frog development, particularly during the egg and larval stages. However, the effect of temperatures experienced early in ontogeny on later larval behaviour or response to agrochemicals is little known.2. Eggs of the Australian frog Limnodynastes peronii were reared at two temperatures that simulate naturally occurring cool and warm temperature regimes (14 +/- 3degreesC and 20 +/- 3degreesC). Tadpoles were then exposed to sublethal concentrations of the organochlorine insecticide endosulfan, at a common temperature. Endosulfan often contaminates aquatic environments, yet its effects on Australian frogs are unknown. Tadpoles reduced feeding after 48 h of exposure to endosulfan concentrations that occur in the field (both 0.03 mug l(-1) and 1.3 mug l(-1)). Feeding remained depressed at 1.3 mug l(-1) endosulfan up to 9 days after tadpoles were transferred to endosulfan-free water.3. Egg-rearing temperature and endosulfan interacted to affect tadpole length. Further, tadpoles exposed to endosulfan were significantly shorter than control tadpoles. They were also more vulnerable to capture by an invertebrate (odonate) predator than controls of the same size when tested 9 days after transfer to clean water. While warm egg-rearing temperatures significantly decreased vulnerability to capture, tadpoles were proportionally more adversely affected by endosulfan. Thus, egg-rearing temperature altered predator avoidance and changed the way in which endosulfan affected growth. Moreover, endosulfan significantly decreased feeding, growth and predator avoidance.4. Synthesis and applications. Not only can short-term exposure to endosulfan at levels within regulatory guidelines and frequently reported in natural waterbodies influence tadpole viability, but the sensitivity of the tadpoles to this effect depends upon the thermal regimes that they encounter over their first few days of life. These data therefore suggest that existing water quality prescriptions may not provide adequate protection, while also illustrating how aspects of climate and thermal regimes might interact with pesticides to have cumulative effects on amphibian fitness.									78	2	0	0	74	0	81			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000188541900010

The linked approach shows the importance of seasonal and ontogenetic prey switching for zooplanktivorous pink salmon, and illustrates the critical role played by lipid-rich Forage species, especially the gonatid squid Berrytheuthis anonychus, in connecting zooplankton to upper trophic level production in the subarctic North Pacific. The results highlight the need to uncover natural mechanisms responsible for accelerated late winter and early spring growth of salmon, especially with respect to climate change and zooplankton bloom timing, Our results indicate that the best match between modeled and observed high-seas pink salmon growth requires the inclusion of two factors into bioenergetics models: (1) decreasing energetic foraging costs for salmon as zooplankton are concentrated by the spring shallowing of pelagic mixed-layer depth and (2) the ontogenetic switch of salmon diets from zooplankton to squid. Finally, we varied the timing and input levels of coastal salmon production to examine effects of density-dependent coastal processes on ocean feeding; coastal processes that place relatively minor limitations on salmon growth may delay the seasonal timing of ontogenetic diet shifts and thus have a magnified effect on overall salmon growth rates.

Growth of juvenile American lobster Homarus americanus in a changing environment								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				557				177	187		10.3354/meps11854				SEP 28 2016	2016	In recent years, the abundance of American lobster Homarus americanus stocks has increased exponentially in coastal Maine, which is likely due to increased recruitment, enhanced growth rates, and decreased predation. This study analyzed the effects of lobster size (12-19.9, 20-29.9, and 30-39.9 mm carapace length, CL) and temperature on growth rates using an 18 yr mark-recapture study in coastal Maine during a period of considerable warming in the Gulf of Maine. Our results showed that the smallest size class of lobsters grew significantly faster than the 2 larger size classes. Peak molt incidence occurred in June and September for all size classes. Greater percent growth measurements were significantly more frequent in warm years for the 12-19.9 mm CL size class, and were also found to be significantly more frequent in the spring season during warm years for all size classes combined. In addition, time at 50% molt probability for the 20-29.9 mm CL and 30-39.9 mm CL size classes was significantly shorter in warm years. This study represents one of the first documentations of growth of small juvenile American lobsters (<20 mm CL) in the wild, and provides evidence of how juvenile growth varies between warm and cold years. Collectively, our findings have implications for how warming sea water temperatures may affect lobster stock productivity, and are of value to lobster stock assessment models and resource management efforts.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000387114000013

Specimens (n = 1069) were collected over 24 h sampling operations in March, June, September and December 1995. Higher values for the weight fullness index (WFI: the ash-free dry weight of the stomach content divided by the wet body weight) occurred in March (0.083) and December (0.092). Higher numbers of empty stomachs occurred in June (24%) and September (28%), whereas in March and December empty stomachs represented only 14%. Feeding activity occurs essentially in twilight periods, but this pattern tends to disappear as water temperature rises. The daily ration varied between 5% and 9% body weight per day (BW d(-1)) according to Elliot and Persson's method, and between 2% and 5% BW d(-1) with the Eggers method. The values of the evacuation rates ranged from 0.469 h(-1) in June to 0.191 h(-1) in December. Temperature has a major role, by conditioning the animal's energetic needs as well as determining a higher gastric evacuation rate. Sex, maturity stage, and food type seem to have an effect on the rate of feeding activity. Both females and mature individuals presented higher values for the WFI.

We examined the stomachs of lake trout, spanning ages 1 through 16, caught in both nearshore and offshore environments of Lake Michigan during 1994 and 1995 to determine whether diet differences may be responsible for the difference in growth rate. A comparison of the diets, coupled with bioenergetics modeling, indicated that juvenile lake trout on Sheboygan Reef experienced slow growth due to low food availability rather than to cold water temperatures. The availability of appropriate-size prey appeared to regulate lake trout growth. Small prey fish were probably not readily available to small (200- to 399-mm total length) lake trout on Sheboygan Reef, a substantial portion of whose diet consisted of invertebrates: in contrast, nearshore juveniles had a nearly 100% fish dirt. Growth rate on the reef remained slow through intermediate lake trout sizes (400-599 mm total length), presumably due to low availability of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax on the reef. Once lake trout achieved total lengths of approximately 600 mm, they grew slightly faster on Sheboygan Reef than near shore, indicating that large (>170-mm total length, prey fish were readily available to lake trout in the reef area. On a wet-weight basis, alewife Aloso pseudoharengus dominated the diet of large (600 mm total length) lake trout from both the nearshore and offshore regions of the lake, although bloater Coregonus hoyi composed over 30% of the diet on Sheboygan Reef and in southeastern nearshore Lake Michigan. Size of alewife prey increased with lake trout size. The bloater population currently represents the bulk of the biomass of the adult prey fish community, so our diet analysis suggests that large lake trout are continuing to select alewives.									110	0	0	0	103	0	111			0002-8487			WOS:000076792000007		
J	Govindarajulu, Purnima; Price, Wm Stephen; Anholt, Bradley R.								Introduced bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in western Canada: Has their ecology diverged?								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				40	2			249	260		10.1670/68-05A.1				JUN 2006	2006	Organisms can diverge in life history when introduced outside their native range due to release from predators, competitors, and parasites, and also due to genetic drift and local adaptation. We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20 degrees C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 +/- 7,296 eggs (mean standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range.									32	1	1	0	33	1	34			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000238621400014

The ecological conversion efficiencies were significantly different among these species. As indicated, the food conversion efficiencies and the energy conversion efficiencies varied from 12.9% to 42.1% and from 12.7% to 43.0%, respectively. Water temperature and ration level are the main factors influencing the ecological conversion efficiencies of marine fish. The higher conversion efficiency of a given species in a natural ecosystem is acquired only under the moderate environment conditions. A negative relationship between ecological conversion efficiency and trophic level among ten species was observed. Such a relationship indicates that the ecological efficiency in the upper trophic levels would increase after fishing down marine food web in the Yellow Sea ecosystem.

Microfragmenting for the successful restoration of slow growing massive corals								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				123				86	94		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.08.017				NOV 2018	2018	Slow growing, massive stony corals have often been overlooked in reef-restoration activities, despite their resilience to climate change and contribution to reef framework. Techniques to effectively propagate and outplant these species have proven challenging. However, advancement in methodology may increase rates of success. In 2013, Orbicella faveolata and Montastrea cavernosa fragments were outplanted on reefs in the Florida Keys at a nearshore and offshore location, to determine whether "microfragmenting" corals, the process of creating similar to 1 cm(2) fragments, increased outplant survival and growth compared with larger fragments (16-64 cm(2)).Arrays of eight microfragments were planted near one larger fragment of similar size at each location. Six replicate pairs were haphazardly placed within each similar to 700 m(2) study site. Fragments at both sites were monitored for growth and survival over 31 months, spanning two bleaching events. Initial predation occurred on microfragments, but was absent in the larger fragments. Survival and growth differed between sites, but did not differ between the larger fragments and microfragment arrays. However, excluding plots with > 40% predation at the nearshore site showed that O. faveolata microfragment arrays produced 10 times more tissue than traditionally used larger fragments. Results from this study suggest that if predation events are reduced, massive corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes.									22	0	0	0	14	0	22			0925-8574	1872-6992		WOS:000446253500009

The 30 native Pyramica may represent a remnant Arctotertiary forest ant fauna. The 9 introduced species of Pyramica and Strumigenys conic from both Old and New World tropics. Surveys of the southeastern fauna appear incomplete, and there may be additional undescribed species. All species are predatory, capturing small arthropods, especially Collembola, by means of a specialized jaw-snapping mechanism. The notable diversity in mandibular structure among species is unexplained in a functional sense. Arrays of specialized clypeal hairs, usually species-specific, may possibly lure prey. Specialized "spongiform bodies" in the petiolar area may be defensive. Local populations may be threatened by habitat loss, invasive exotic species, and climate change.									13	0	0	0	16	0	17			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000267770300001		
J	Carver, CE; Chisholm, A; Mallet, AL				Mallet, Huguette/H-8368-2012				Strategies to mitigate the impact of Ciona intestinalis (L.) biofouling on shellfish production								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				22	3			621	631						DEC 2003	2003	A sudden increase in the population of the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis (L.) is causing serious biofouling problems for shellfish growers on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The objective of the present study was to document the growth, spawning, and recruitment patterns of this species, and to develop strategies to minimize its impact on the culture of European oysters at two locations in Lunenburg Bay, Nova Scotia. Profiles of condition index, which may be indicative of spawning activity, suggested that the C. intestinalis population at the Bayport site spawned from mid-May through June, whereas the population at Mason's Beach spawned from mid-July to mid-August. Histological assessment of reproductive status indicated a period of gametogenesis in March-April (>3degreesC) followed by spawning from mid-May to mid-August (>8degreesC). Although mature eggs were observed in the ovary in July-August, spawning trials suggested a decline in the fecundity of the Bayport population during this period. Two main recruitment events were observed at Mason's Beach (June and August), but only one at Bayport (June). From the data on fecundity and settlement rates, it was estimated that a 100-mm long C. intestinalis (0.6 g dry weight) may produce 12,000 eggs in a season and that recruitment intensity may reach 3,000 individuals m(-2). Laboratory predation trials indicated that rock crabs (Cancer irroratus) consumed significantly more C. intestinalis than did green crabs (Carcinus maenas). A maximum predation rate of I I individuals per day per rock crab (80 mm carapace width) was recorded at peak water temperatures of 18degreesC. In a series of chemical width eradication trials, exposure to 5% acetic acid was found to be a more effective strategy for eliminating C. intestinalis than hydrated lime, saturated brine, or hypochlorite solution. Total mortality was observed following exposure to 5% acetic acid for 15 to 30 s, with no corresponding mortality in the control mussels or oysters. Initial field trials indicated that spraying with acetic acid might prove to be an effective means of eliminating C. intestinalis under commercial conditions.									122	1	0	0	126	1	132			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000188365100004

The development of artificial lakes and constructed wetlands in nutrient-rich rivers is a widely used management tool in the fight to decrease eutrophication. Juvenile salmonids that have to negotiate these lakes during their downstream migration to the sea are commonly subjected to high mortality due to increased predation pressure and delayed passage. In this study, we double tagged 39 brown trout smolts with passive integrated transponder and radio tags to gain further insight into predation rates and migration patterns during their passage of an artificial lake in a Danish lowland stream in the spring of 2016. Thirty-four of the tagged smolts, caught and released upstream, entered the lake, of which 22 (65%) successfully exited the lake. Four smolts (12%) returned upstream to the river. Three smolts were predated in the lake by two northern pike (Esox lucius). Three tags were recovered from the lake bottom, and two disappeared out of the study area after a last detection in the lake. Tracking the smolts manually and by automatic listening stations showed highly erratic movement patterns during lake passage. Further, we observed long delays of up to 27days after the smolts reached the river mouth and before they entered the sea, potentially due to low sea water temperature or due to the stocking of a large amount of hatchery-reared brown trout smolts. The results are discussed in the context of abiotic and biotic factors, which differed considerably in the year 2016 compared with previous years.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1535-1459	1535-1467		WOS:000446330200002

Diel vertical migrations (DVM) are typical for many cold-water fish species such as Pacific salmons (Oncorhynchus spp.) and coregonids (Coregonus spp.) inhabiting deep lakes. A comprehensive recent overview of DVM in freshwater fish has not been available, however. 2. The main proximate trigger of DVM in freshwater fish is the diel change in light intensity, with declining illumination at dusk triggering the ascent and the increase at dawn triggering the descent. Additional proximate cues are hydrostatic pressure and water temperature, which may guide fish into particular water layers at night. 3. Ultimate causes of DVM encompass bioenergetics efficiency, feeding opportunities and predator avoidance. None of these factors alone can explain the DVM in all cases. Multi-factorial hypotheses, such as the antipredation window combined with the thermal niche hypothesis, are more likely to explain DVM. It is suggested that planktivorous fish move within a layer sufficiently well illuminated to capture zooplankton, but too dark for predators to feed upon the migrating fish. In complete darkness, fish seek layers with a temperature that optimises bioenergetics efficiency. The strength of each factor may differ from lake to lake, and hence system-specific individual analyses are needed. 4. Mechanistic details that are still poorly explored are the costs of buoyancy regulation and migration, the critical light thresholds for feeding of planktivorous and piscivorous fish, and predator assessment by (and size-dependent predation risk of) the prey fish. 5. A comprehensive understanding of the adaptive value of DVM can be attained only if the behaviour of individual fish within migrating populations is explicitly taken into account. Size, condition and reproductive value differ between individuals, suggesting that migrating populations should split into migrants and non-migrants for whom the balance between mortality risk and growth rate can differ. There is increasing evidence for this type of partial DVM within populations. 6. Whereas patterns of DVM are well documented, the evolution of DVM is still only poorly understood. Because experimental approaches at realistic natural scales remain difficult, a combination of comprehensive data sets with modelling is likely to resolve the relative importance of different proximate and ultimate causes behind DVM in fish.									71	1	2	0	68	3	75			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000305000700002

(Cephalopoda) in Morbihan Bay, France								JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES				64				263	274		10.1093/mollus/64.3.263				AUG 1998	1998	The nursery grounds of Sepia officinalis were identified in the Gulf of Morbihan, on the Atlantic coast of France, and their abiotic and biotic features described. From the measurement of the young cuttlefish captured, their growth and development could be followed through a period of five months. Analysis of the stomach contents of the cuttlefish and identification of the prey consumed gave a measure of their feeding activity and diet. The young animals were concentrated in the two parts (East and West) of Morbihan Bay. These were distinguished by different sediments (sandy-mud in the East and sand with shell-debris in the West) and by water temperature (higher in the East which allow a greater growth of the young cuttlefish). These sites are rich in crustaceans Amphipoda, Brachyura and Macrura which compose the diet of young cuttlefish. Fish (Gobiidae and Syngnathidae) appear in the diet from August. The feeding activity of the cuttlefish (given by the repletion quotient) increased from June to August reaching about 80% in both parts of the Bay. It decreased to nearly 50% in September and October.									31	0	0	0	26	0	32			0260-1230			WOS:000075956700001		
J	Nys, Lauren N.; Fabrizio, Mary C.; Tuckey, Troy D.					Fabrizio, Mary/0000-0002-6115-5490			Multi-decadal variation in size of juvenile Summer Flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) in Chesapeake Bay								JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				107		SI		112	120		10.1016/j.seares.2015.12.001				JAN 2016	2016	During the last quarter-century, management of Summer Flounder Paralichthys dentatus along the Atlantic coast resulted in significant increases in abundance such that rebuilding targets were recently achieved. Although spawning stock biomass is high, recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) Summer Flounder remains variable. Chesapeake Bay is one of the principal nursery areas for this species, but processes such a growth and survival that affect production of YOY Summer Flounder in this estuary have not been explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between abundance and size of Summer Flounder recruits from the 1988 to 2012 year classes in Chesapeake Bay. We also considered the effects of environmental factors on fish size because conditions in the bay vary spatially during the time that fish occupy nursery areas. To describe variations in Summer Flounder size, we used monthly length observations from 13,018 YOY fish captured by bottom trawl from the lower Chesapeake Bay and the James, York, and Rappahannock river subestuaries where Summer Flounder are commonly observed. We applied a generalized additive model to describe spatial, temporal, and environmental effects on observed fish size; we also considered the density of Summer Flounder and an index of productivity as factors in the model. Summer Flounder in Chesapeake Bay exhibited density-dependent and spatially related variations in mean length: larger fish were found mostly in the Bay and smaller fish in the subestuaries. Additionally, low (<13 degrees C) and high (>26 degrees C) temperatures and low salinities (<10 psu) had a negative effect on fish size, indicating that individuals found in these environments were typically smaller than conspecifics inhabiting areas of moderate temperatures and higher salinities. Variable nursery habitat conditions in temperate estuaries affect fish size and, subsequently, may influence production of Summer Flounder year classes through effects on maturation and survival. As water temperatures in the mid-Atlantic region continue to increase, YOY Summer Flounder size may be negatively affected.

In order to evaluate the potential to control C. polykrikoides red tides dominated by using mass-cultured heterotrophic protistan grazers, we monitored the abundance of Strombidinopsis jeokjo (a naked ciliate) and C. polykrikoides after mass-cultured S. jeokjo was introduced into mesocosms (ca. 601) deployed in situ and containing natural red tide waters dominated by C. polykrikoides. Water temperature, salinity, and pH, as well as the abundance of co-occurring other protists and metazooplankton were measured concurrently. To compare the growth and ingestion rates of S. jeokjo feeding on cultured versus natural populations of C. polykrikoides, we also monitored the abundance of cultured C. polykrikoides and S. jeokjo in bottles during laboratory grazing experiments. S. jeokjo introduced into the mesocosms grew well, effectively reducing natural populations of C. polykrikoides from approximately 1000 cells ml(-1) to below 10 cells ml(-1) within 2 days. The growth and ingestion rates of cultured S. jeokjo on natural populations of C. polykrikoides in the mesocosms for the first 30 h (0.72 day(-1) and 51 ng C grazer(-1) day(-1)) were 84% and 44%, respectively, of those measured in the laboratory during bottle incubations with similar initial prey concentrations. The calculated grazing impact of S. jeokjo on natural populations of C. polykrikoides suggests that large-scale cultures of this ciliate could be used for controlling red tides by C. polykrikoides in small areas.

J	Price, Rebecca M.								The influence of emersion on the rate at which Nucella lamellosa (Muricidae) consumes prey in the laboratory								AMERICAN MALACOLOGICAL BULLETIN				30	2			255	259		10.4003/006.030.0204				JUL 18 2012	2012	Nucella lamellosa (Gmelin, 1791) is a phenotypically plastic species that preys on barnacles and occurs intertidally and subtidally along the north-eastern Pacific coast. This laboratory experiment tests the hypothesis that daily episodes of emersion impose a greater stress than daily episodes of limiting food in N. lamellosa. In this experiment, individuals of N. lamellosa were housed in containers with a rock covered with barnacles. In one experimental treatment, I removed snails from their barnacle-covered rocks and placed them on a counter for five hours each day. In another treatment, I placed the snail-and-rock assemblage on a counter for five hours each day. In a final experimental treatment, I kept the snails submersed, but placed the barnacle-covered rocks in an empty sea table for five hours each day. A control treatment kept individuals constantly submersed with continuous access to food. To account for the effect of handling the snails, individuals in a manipulation control were picked up and then immediately returned to their rocks. When individuals of N. lamellosa were removed from the water without their barnacle-covered rocks, they ate significantly less than snails in either control group and significantly less than the snails that were constantly submersed but without food for five hours a day. This result suggests that daily episodes of emersion are more stressful than daily episodes of limiting food.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0740-2783			WOS:000306764000004

The abundance of insect herbivores is mediated by interactions with higher and lower trophic levels. This research asks (i) how phenological change across trophic levels affects host plant quality and selection for aphids, and (ii) what higher trophic level mechanisms drive aphid abundance.2. Ligusticum porteri is a perennial host for the sap-feeding aphid Aphis asclepiadis and intraguild mirid predators (chiefly Lygus hesperus) in Colorado. We used long-term observational data to discover that aphids and mirids respond differently to phenological cues. These unique responses can impact aphid abundance through changes to host plant selection and quality.3. We used behavioural choice assays to assess how advanced mirid phenology influences aphid host plant selection. More alates landed and reproduced on mirid-free control plants relative to host plants with prior mirid feeding. However, this preference did not correlate with aphid performance when we compared aphid relative growth rates between treatments. This suggests that advanced mirid phenology would impact aphid populations more through host plant choice, rather than reductions in host quality. The addition of mirids to experimental aphid colonies also demonstrated reduced aphid colony growth via predation.4. We measured plant cues involved in host selection and found differences in volatile composition between plants with prior mirid feeding compared to control plants, providing the potential for aphids to detect enemy-free space using volatile cues.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:000529284300001

When the density and biomass of drifting invertebrates declined with water temperature during the fall, stomach contents and body conditions substantially decreased among both wild and stocked fish. During the coldest portion of the winter, the density of small drifting invertebrates increased as did the body conditions of both wild and hatchery trout. We suggest that the perceived increase in body conditions during late winter was due to survival of fish with higher body conditions and not growth of fish from fall to late winter.									17	0	0	0	17	0	18			0002-8487			WOS:000165422300011

Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata mendotae were particularly infested (mean maximum diatom density, 22,900 cells animal-1). Laboratory experiments revealed that infested Daphnia had greater sinking and filtering rates than uninfested animals. Respiration rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Field-collected animals were counted and scored for degree of infestation, number of eggs, and total body size. Abundance of both adult and immature Daphnia increased only after the epibiont no longer infested Daphnia. Clutch size was not significantly different between infested and uninfested Daphnia, but death rates were higher during the period of infestation. This increased mortality is attributed to added stress on individuals caused by the epibiont, demonstrating the translation of physiological effects into population level consequences.									41	1	1	0	37	1	44			0024-3590			WOS:A1993LK31400010

Strengthening western boundary currents play a role in this phenomenon, with sea surface temperatures (SST) in their paths rising faster than the global average. To understand how dynamic oceanography influences food availability in these ocean warming "hotspots", we use a novel prey capture signature derived from accelerometry to understand how the warm East Australian Current shapes foraging success by a meso-predator, the little penguin. This seabird feeds on low trophic level species that are sensitive to environmental change. We found that in 2012, prey capture success by penguins was high when SST was low relative to the long-term mean. In 2013 prey capture success was low, coincident with an unusually strong penetration of warm water. Overall there was an optimal temperature range for prey capture around 19-21 degrees C, with lower success at both lower and higher temperatures, mirroring published relationships between commercial sardine catch and SST. Spatially, higher SSTs corresponded to a lower probability of penguins using an area, and lower prey capture success. These links between high SST and reduced prey capture success by penguins suggest negative implications for future resource availability in a system dominated by a strengthening western boundary current.									19	0	0	0	15	0	19			2045-2322			WOS:000371108700001	26923901

Diapause is an important life history trait that should be taken into account when planning biological control in temperate regions. Diapause in N. californicus is highly variable across the global range. However, little is known to the Korean population of N. californicus. We studied the diapause induction of the N. californicus population originated from the southern island of Jeju, which is the only part of the country where N. californicus naturally occurs. Diapause induction was tested under the combination conditions of four constant temperatures (15, 18, 21, and 24 degrees C) and five photoperiods (6:18, 8:16, 10:14, 12:12, and 14:10 (L:D) h) with one or two generation exposures. Results showed that adult females in every treatment oviposited, indicating that diapause was not induced under these conditions. The preoviposition period was longer at lower temperatures (5.7 +/- 0.23 d at 15 degrees C) and gradually shortened as temperature increased (1.1 d +/- 0.04 at 24 degrees C). Reproduction and prey egg consumption were higher as temperature increased. In light of these findings, we discuss the potential use of N. californicus as a biological agent of spider mites in greenhouses and on field crops in temperate climate regions.									5	0	0	0	6	0	6			0164-7954			WOS:000299877200005		
J	Plante, CJ; Mayer, LM				Mayer, Lawrence/A-1337-2009				Seasonal variability in the bacteriolytic capacity of the deposit feeder Arenicola marina: Environmental correlates								AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				11	2			101	109		10.3354/ame011101				NOV 7 1996	1996	Although deposit-feeding macrofauna consume and digest sedimentary bacteria, it is unclear whether feeding rates and digestion efficiencies are high enough to significantly impact the composition and abundance of bacteria in marine sediments. It is likely that both feeding rates and efficiency of digestion vary markedly through space and time. We used a turbidimetric assay to compare the rate of bacteriolysis by digestive fluids collected seasonally from the deposit-feeding polychaete Arenicola marina. Under standardized, experimental conditions, bacteriolytic rates represent concentrations of lytic agents. This concentration was found to vary significantly throughout the year (p = 0.001), showing greater than a 2x range. Lytic agent concentration was positively correlated with bioavailable amino acid concentrations in the surface sediment (r = 0.85, p = 0.03) but showed no apparent relationship to other proxies for food resources (e.g, chl a), sediment temperature, or gut throughput time. In vitro, temperature has been shown to have a strong positive influence on bacteriolytic rate. Temperature has no influence, however, on the in situ concentration of lytic agent in gut fluids, thus it appears that compensation for this temperature dependence is unimportant. These findings, combined with previous kinetics studies with A. marina gut fluids, predict that the quantitative influence of deposit feeding on the microbial ecology of sediments will exhibit clear seasonal variation.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0948-3055	1616-1564		WOS:A1996VU26900001		
J	SANGPRADUB, N; GILLER, PS								GUT MORPHOLOGY, FEEDING RATE AND GUT CLEARANCE IN 5 SPECIES OF CADDIS LARVAE								HYDROBIOLOGIA				287	2			215	223		10.1007/BF00010736				JUL 22 1994	1994	Feeding rate, the rate of movement of food through the gut and gut morphology of large larvae of five caddis species (Halesus radiatus, Hydropsyche instabilis, Polycentropus kingi, Rhyacophila dorsalis and Potamophylax cingulatus) were investigated in the laboratory. Following 72 hr starvation, P. cingulatus and H. radiatus larvae became satiated (refused prey offered directly to the mouthparts) after consuming 8-11 and 9-13 mayfly nymphs (Baetis rhodani, 3.5-4.6 mm) respectively. Hunger level affected prey consumption. In P. cingulatus, the number of prey consumed over 24 h (at 9.5-12-degrees-C) increased with starvation periods from 0-72 h, but declined following longer starvation periods.Six clearly recognisable gut states (defined by the position of food material in various parts of the gut) can be identified at different times since commencement of a meal. As environmental temperature increased (from 8-12-degrees-C to 15-17-degrees-C), the rate of change of the gut state increased and the food retention time decreased in all species. Feeding periodicity (i.e. nocturnal/diurnal activity) in the field was estimated based on the evacuation rate and the gut state and environmental temperature at the known time of collection. Initiation of consumption of prey appeared to coincide with emptying of the foregut and proximal midgut, whereas actual feeding continued until complete satiation when some threshold' fullness of the foregut had been reached. The length of time food was held in the foregut was positively correlated with increasing specialisation of the foregut (particularly elaboration of the proventriculus).									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0018-8158			WOS:A1994PD06800006

Northern Benguela Merluccius paradoxus Annual Growth From Otolith Chronologies Used for Age Verification and as Indicators of Fisheries-Induced and Environmental Changes								FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE				7						315	10.3389/fmars.2020.00315				MAY 8 2020	2020	In this study we develop a 32-year (1982-2013) otolith biochronology of the commercially important deepwater hake Merluccius paradoxus in the northern Benguela, Namibia. Mean annual growth (mm) calculated from 140 thin-sectioned M. paradoxus otoliths were compared with change in mean length at age 3 to age 4 determined from Namibian whole-otolith-read age-length keys (ALKs). Annual growth rates calculated from the two methods (overlapping 2000-2013) were strongly positively correlated (rho = 0.730, n = 14, p < 0.01). This indirectly validated annual age determination of M. paradoxus, the accuracy of otolith chronologies, and the ability of ALKs to capture annual variability in fish growth. Annual M. paradoxus growth rates were significantly positively correlated with the July-September upwelling index 1982-2013 at 30 degrees S, (rho = 0.414, n = 32, p < 0.05) and positively correlated with August mean chlorophyll-a concentrations (as indicator for primary production) 2002-2013 in the 28-30 degrees S area (rho = 0.734, n = 12, p < 0.01). Annual M. paradoxus growth rates significantly negatively correlated with October (austral spring) sea surface temperatures in the 24-28 degrees S area (rho = -0.381, n = 32, p < 0.05). This Orange-River Namaqua upwelling cell corresponds to the area where juvenile and young adult M. paradoxus live, suggesting growth rate strongly responds to local forcing. We also determined that mean length-at-age 3 calculated from ALKs (current and literature) significantly increased from 1977 through 2016 at 0.075 cm.year(-1) (t = 3.04, df = 41, p = 0.004), while length-at-age 8 significantly decreased at 0.25 cm.year(-1) (t = -3.59, df = 30, p = 0.001). Both trends may indicate fisheries-induced adaptive changes. M. paradoxus occurring at >300 m bottom depth, are thus strongly influenced by fisheries. As an upper-level demersal predator, this species integrates signals throughout the food web to provide a unique "view from the top" of long-term changes in the northern Benguela upwelling system. These results provide background ranges of growth variability and context for what will likely be negative impacts of predicted decreases in future upwelling.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2296-7745		WOS:000531311500001

Here, we investigate shell plasticity in the intertidal gastropod Littorina littorea in response to the ocean acidification and elevated temperature values predicted for 2100, focusing on shell traits known to relate to protection from predators (size, shape and thickness) and resistance to desiccation (aperture shape). We also measured and desiccation rates (measured as percentage water loss). Ocean acidification was simulated by bubbling carbon dioxide into closed-circuit tanks at concentrations of 380 and 1000 ppm, giving respective pH levels of 8.0 and 7.7; temperatures were set at 15 or 20 C. Both low pH and elevated temperature disrupted the overall investment in shell material; snails in acidified seawater and elevated temperature in isolation or in combination had lower shell growth rates than control individuals. The percentage increase in shell length was also lower for individuals kept under combined acidified seawater and elevated temperature, and the percentage of shell thickness increase at the growing edge was lower under acidified and combined conditions. Shells were also more globular (i.e. had lower aspect ratios) under elevated temperature and lower pH. Desiccation rates were lower at low pH and high temperature. Counter to predictions, water loss did not relate to shell biometric measures but was negatively correlated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations. Finally, ATP concentration was positively correlated with shell thickening and weight, confirming the idea that negative effects of exposure to elevated pCO(2)/low pH and elevated temperature on shell morphology may occur (at least in part) through metabolic disruption.									61	2	0	0	54	0	63			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000313344300012

Diel temperature patterns of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris, in a shallow-water nursery								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				80	5	SI		1436	1448		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03263.x				APR 2012	2012	The relatively complex pattern of temperature selection exhibited by juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris in the North Sound differed markedly from many previously described responses of fish preferenda. Thermal data demonstrated that juvenile N. brevirostris did not attempt to behaviourally maintain a constant eccritic temperature. Rather, juveniles selected progressively warmer temperatures throughout the day until reaching the highest temperatures available, and then moved to cooler temperatures during late evening and early morning hours. It is possible that by exploiting habitat thermal heterogeneity juvenile N. brevirostris prolong activities such as feeding or digestion well into the cooler parts of the evening. The complex pattern of temperature occupation by juvenile N. brevirostris within the thermally heterogeneous North Sound nursery is probably linked to key daily activities such as prey capture, predator avoidance and digestive efficiency.

After an introductory chapter on history and general approach of zooplankton studies, the four main contributions review distribution patterns, cycles and trends in temporal variation, trophic interactions and population dyamics and production.The distribution of zooplankton species in relation to hydrography and origin of watermasses is described for copepods. It highlights the influence of Atlantic Ocean influx from the north-west, which to a large extent dominates the species composition and its seasonal variation in the summer-stratified waters. In contrast, the more neritic communities in the southeast region mainly depend on the local populations of the species abundant in coastal mixed waters.The chapter on cycles and trends in temporal variation discusses the differences in seasonal variation with respect to species, area, and community structure in terms of herbivores, omnivores and carnivores. The year-to-year changes are considered as dependent on the overwintering stocks and strategies. Patterns in long-term variation appearing from long-term data series are related to climatic changes, leading to two hypotheses with respect to the effects of changes in wind regime.The chapter on trophic interactions deals with the utilization of primary particulate production by planktonic herbivores and its variation in time and space. Emphasis is put on differences between north and south, which are partly due to differences in species composition, community structure and seasonal variation already discussed in foregoing chapters. The various aspects of copepod grazing are reviewed, but also the role of microzooplankton as both grazers and food organisms is brought to attention.The last chapter deals with population dynamics and production of key species. Seasonal fluctuations in abundance and biomass are discussed and related to underlying population processes and characteristics such as reproduction and life strategy, growth and development, and mortality. Secondary-production estimates inferred from biomass and growth rate estimates are discussed.									151	0	0	0	101	0	151			0077-7579			WOS:A1991HB29300002		
J	Rauter, CM; Brodmann, PA; Reyer, HU								Provisioning behaviour in relation to food availability and nestling food demand in the water pipit Anthus spinoletta								ARDEA				88	1			81	90						2000	2000	Insufficient food provisioning by parents can reduce growth rate of altricial nestlings, their size and weight at fledging, and also affect survival. Therefore at low food availability parents should increase their food provisioning effort. In insectivorous Water Pipits Anthus spinoletta prey biomass differed up to 50 times among home ranges; nevertheless, number, size and weight of fledglings did not differ between home ranges with low and high prey biomass. Based on predictions from the literature, we investigated whether and how parents adjust their provisioning behaviour to food availability, measured by arthropod biomass, and to nestling demands, measured by brood size, nestling age and ambient temperature. Foraging distances did not vary significantly with any of the four variables. Feeding rates were also not related to food availability, but increased with brood size in both sexes. In addition, females showed a tendency to increase feeding rate with decreasing air temperature. Our results suggest that, at least in some years, arthropod food is so abundant in the birds' environment that it does not limit reproductive success.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			0373-2266	2213-1175		WOS:000088066900008		
J	Cairns, David K.; Gaston, Anthony J.; Huettmann, Falk								Endothermy, ectothermy and the global structure of marine vertebrate communities								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				356				239	250		10.3354/meps07286				2008	2008	Birds and mammals are the leading marine predators at high latitudes, while sharks and other large fish occupy top positions in tropical waters. The present study proposes that temperature-dependent predation success (TPS) explains global patterns of marine vertebrate community structure. Burst speed increases with temperature in ectotherms but is independent of temperature in endotherms. If capture success depends on relative swimming speeds of predator and prey, ectothermic prey will be more vulnerable to attack by endothermic predators at low temperatures. Conversely, high temperatures should enhance the ability of ectothermic predators to prey on endotherms. Pursuit-diving seabirds (penguins, auks and some cormorants) and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) are ubiquitous in ocean waters with summer surface temperatures cooler than the mid-teens to low 20s (degrees C) but are virtually absent in warmer regions. We suggest that the near-absence of these animals at low latitudes is due to TPS, as warm water increases the difficulty of capturing fish prey and increases vulnerability to predation by large ectothermic and partially endothermic sharks. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are virtually absent from warm temperate and tropical waters, even where primary productivity and fisheries data suggest that food supplies are ample. This indicates that the low productivity that prevails in much of the tropical zone cannot explain the worldwide distributional patterns of pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds. Endothermy in marine communities increases with cooler temperatures and with animal size. Pursuit-diving birds and pinnipeds are sensitive to temperature limits and may suffer important range contractions as oceans warm.									29	0	0	0	29	0	33			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000254963900020		
J	van Woesik, Robert; Jordan-Garza, Adan Guillermo								Coral populations in a rapidly changing environment								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				408	1-2	SI		11	20		10.1016/j.jembe.2011.07.022				NOV 15 2011	2011	Contemporary coral populations are being forced to survive through disturbances at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding disturbances in the context of ecological processes may lead to models that accurately predict population trajectories. Few studies examine the key ecological processes that drive changes on reefs. Processes of major interest include reproduction, recruitment, post-settlement mortality, coral growth, fragmentation, and mortality. These population processes are dependent on macro-processes, such as predation and herbivory, which in turn vary in accordance with regional oceanography. Some coral-reef regions experience high-frequency temperature anomalies, whereas other regions experience low-frequency anomalies. It may turn out that corals in the high-frequency regions are also most likely to undergo rapid directional selection, and adapt to climate change, because only alleles experiencing persistent selection pressure may attain high frequency. Yet corals are clonal organisms and the same genotypes are often exposed to different environments and to different selective pressures. Therefore, when comparing coral-population trajectories across regions and oceans, it is critical to understand the key processes of corals within local, regional, and historical contexts.

Determining the extent to which various bivalve species ingest sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) larvae under controlled laboratory conditions was an important first step towards understanding the potential for shellfish to reduce the number of these copepod larvae in the water column at net pens. A series of laboratory experiments examined the effects of temperature (similar to 5, 10, and 15 degrees C), diet (larvae alone or with phytoplankton), and bivalve size (small, medium, and large) on the amount of L. salmonis larvae ingested by basket cockles (Clinocardium nuttallii), Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), mussels (Mytilus spp.), and Pacific scallops (unconfirmed hybrid: Mizuhopecten yessoensis x Patinopecten caurinus). Feeding rate was assessed by placing bivalves individually in 2-l containers holding approximately 450 larvae in 750 ml of filtered seawater. Results of the temperature/diet experiments indicated that all four species of bivalves ingested sea lice larvae, regardless of phytoplankton presence or absence, and that temperature had no significant effect on the proportion of larvae ingested. All three sizes of oysters and scallops ingested sea lice larvae, with large shellfish consuming a significantly greater proportion of the larvae than small individuals. Future research, examining the role of bivalves in the control of sea lice, should be continued at a commercial scale at a salmon farm. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, we assess how OA conditions predicted for 2100 affects the biological functioning of an important habitat-forming species Mytilus edulis and its susceptibility to predation by a key predator, the gastropod Nucella lapillus. Change in three physiological parameters in Mytilus were assessed: (1) shell thickness and cross-sectional surface area, (2) body volume and (3) feeding rate, as well as susceptibility to predation by N. lapillus. Shell thickness and cross-section area, body volume and feeding rate of Mytilus all reduced under OA conditions indicating compromised fitness. Predation risk increased by similar to 26% under OA, suggesting increased susceptibility of mussels to predation and/or altered predator foraging behaviour. Notably, predation of large Mytilus - that were largely free from predation under control conditions - increased by more than 8x under OA, suggesting that body size was no longer a refuge. Our results suggest OA will impact upon ecosystem structure and functioning and the continued provision of ecosystem services associated with Mytilus reefs and the communities associated with them.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0141-1136	1879-0291		WOS:000436911600018	29803323

WATERBIRDS				31	3			438	447						SEP 2008	2008	Diet of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was studied using regurgitated pellets, individual fish bones and fish remains collected from below roosting trees at Zelivka and Slapy Reservoirs, Czech Republic, during summer, a warm winter and a cold winter. Both reservoirs have the same trophic status and similar fish assemblages. Using diagnostic bones (as pharyngeum, dentale, praeoperculare) and our own linear regression equations relating dimensions of the diagnostic bone and fish total length (L-r), a total of 2,055 fish of 18 species and four families were identified in the diet of Great Cormorants and their size was reconstructed. Both fish total length and weight differed significantly between seasons being, on average, 12.0 cm and 30 g during summer, 18.3 cm and 109 g during a warm winter. The average weight of fish taken by Great Cormorants significantly increased with decreasing air and water temperature. The contribution of the dominant "large growing", torpedo-shaped fish species in the diet of Great Cormorants dramatically increased from summer to the cold winter. In contrast, the contribution of dominant "small growing", torpedo-shaped species, or humped body-shaped species, showed completely the opposite tendency. Great Cormorants seem to consume all fish of appropriate size that they are able to catch in summer and select for larger fish in winter. Thus, the winter elevation of foraging efficiency described for Great Cormorants in the literature is due to capturing larger fish not to capturing more fish.									33	0	0	0	29	0	33			1524-4695	1938-5390		WOS:000261043500016

Data sets were simulated using an age-structured, linked, predator-prey model of Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), a forage fish native to the Northwest Atlantic, and Atlantic striped bass (Morone saxatilis), its primary predator, with differing time series of fishing mortality on both predator and prey. Simulations generated test data sets for Atlantic menhaden SPMs that included either a static or time-varying intrinsic growth rate parameter. The SPMTVr largely produced more accurate, less variable estimates of exploitation rate and biomass than models with static intrinsic growth. We also applied SPMTVr to empirical Atlantic menhaden catch and survey data for 1964-2016. The SPMTVr fit the survey data well, estimated an intrinsic growth rate time series that mirrored long-term juvenile survey trends, and produced biomass and exploitation rate trends that mirrored a statistical catch-at-age model. The SPMTVr estimated dynamic, maximum sustainable yield (MSY)-based reference points that reflected changing stock productivity.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000496731300008

Here we address how mesoscale oceanographic and environmental variability in the region around PC, CA may influence the distribution, abundance and size of the mussel Mytilus californianus, a competitively dominant species in rocky intertidal assemblages along the northeast Pacific. Strong upwelling and high wave exposure dominate the California coast north of PC, and weak, seasonal upwelling and warmer water temperatures are characteristic of the region south/ east of PC. We hypothesized that the gradient in temperature, upwelling, and wave exposure around PC would greatly influence patterns of recruitment and abundance of mussels, potentially underlying large-scale differences in community structure. We evaluated these predictions by surveying intertidal community structure, mussel distribution, size, abundance and recruitment at a range of intertidal sites around PC. We found that intertidal communities north of PC were dominated mainly by macrophytes, while mussels and barnacles were relatively scarce. Intertidal communities south of PC were dominated by mussels and barnacles, with a low abundance of macrophytes. Mussels were larger and mussel beds were more expansive and extended lower in elevation at sites ranging from north to south around PC. At northern sites, high abundances of sea star predators and elevated wave exposure effectively displaced the entire mussel zone upwards. We found no differences in the numbers of mussel recruits to sites around PC, suggesting that spatial patterns of mussel abundance were not driven by differential recruitment. These results suggest that unlike other well-studied systems, supply of benthic larvae does not underly the large-scale gradient in community structure around PC. We suggest that environmental conditions favorable to macroalgal growth north of PC, and conditions favorable to filter-feeder growth south of PC may underly mesoscale patterns of intertidal community structure in this region.

Thus, differences in sea surface temperatures (SST) may lead to differences in the diet composition of predators, but this link is still unknown in many species. By combining GPS tracking and dive analyses on chick-rearing southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) with stable isotope analyses and monitoring of chick growth rates and chick survival, we here attempted a comprehensive assessment of the effects of inter-annual environmental variability as indicated by SST and chlorophyll a (reflecting primary productivity) data. Inter-annual differences in environmental variables around our study colony on New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands, contradicted the general expectation, with higher chlorophyll a concentrations coinciding with higher spring SST in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010. Penguins foraged further away from the colony during guard and creche in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010, while performing deeper dives in 2009/2010. Stable isotope mixing models suggested a crustacean-dominated chick diet in 2009/2010, compared to a mixture of squid and fish in 2010/2011. These differences in foraging behaviour and diet, however, had no consequences for chick growth rates or chick survival and thus had no apparent effect on population trajectories. Potentially, environmental conditions in both years could still be seen as favourable compared to other years and breeding sites, enabling the parental birds to buffer the environmental differences by plastic foraging behaviour.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000384551500011

ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				135				46	56		10.1016/j.ecss.2013.06.008				DEC 20 2013	2013	Coastal habitats worldwide are threatened by invasive alien species (IAS) that can alter community and ecosystem processes. Invasions are of particular concern for the Mediterranean Sea, and IAS-related descriptors of good ecological status have been recently proposed in European reference regulations.Here, the occurrence of the Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus was analysed in two Mediterranean coastal habitats, the Acquatina lagoon and Torre Colimena basin (SE Italy). The blue crab is to date recognized as an IAS; however, quantitative information on abundance patterns of the species are scant, and its functional role in European waters is virtually unexplored.Blue crabs were sampled seasonally using crab traps. Specimens were enumerated, sexed, and measured. In addition, in both habitats the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of C. sapidus were determined at its maximum seasonal abundance, and compared against those of other representatives of the benthic food web.In the Acquatina lagoon, C sapidus was collected only in spring and summer, while other autochthonous crab species were predominantly captured in winter and autumn. In contrast, in the Torre Colimena basin the blue crab was the only captured brachyuran; it was collected during the whole sampling period, and showed summer abundances more than twice as higher than those observed in the Acquatina lagoon. In both environments, juveniles and ovigerous females were sampled, and males dominated over females. Condition factors calculated using individual width weight data showed that blue crabs from the Torre Colimena basin had higher condition factors compared to those from the Acquatina lagoon.Independently from the environment, Callinectes sapidus delta C-13 values in summer were consistent with those characterizing autochthonous crabs and other representatives of the macrozoobenthos. Its delta N-15 signature, however, varied significantly, suggesting that in the Acquatina lagoon the species may have more predatory trophic habits.Our study indicates the occurrence of established populations of Callinectes sapidus in both study sites, yet characterized by different biological characteristics and roles within the local benthic food web. The results are compared to information on blue crab populations in their native habitats, while their ecological implications are discussed in the context of the effort currently made to clarify the joint effects of invasions and climate change on marine ecosystems.

We analyzed the influence of bottom water temperature and salinity, sediment texture and organic matter content on the spatiotemporal distribution of A. spinimanus. The crabs were collected from January 1998 until December 1999 by trawling with a shrimp fishing boat outfitted with double-rig nets. The sampling took place in Ubatumirim (UBM), Ubatuba (UBA) and Mar Virado (MV) bays, located in the northern coast of Sao Paulo State (Brazil). These three bays were chosen as they differed in many physiographic features. We captured 1,911 crabs (UBM = 351; UBA = 1,509; MV = 51), and there were significant differences in abundance between bays and between stations. The distribution of A. spinimanus was primarily associated with sediment features: abundance was higher in stations with sandy sediments classified as gravel, very coarse sand, and intermediate sand. Portunoidea usually burrow in the sediment for protection against predators and to facilitate the capture of fast prey. In addition, the station with the highest abundance of A. spinimanus was also naturally protected from fishing activities, and composed of heterogeneous sediment, in terms of grain size. Hence, the combination of a favorable sediment heterogeneity and protection from fishery activities seemed to be effective modulators of the abundance and distribution of A. spinimanus in these bays.									2	0	0	0	3	1	3			2167-8359			WOS:000447216100005	30324019

Yet, intentional isolation of native fish populations is a frequently used management strategy to protect against negative interactions with invasive fish species. We evaluated the population viability and genetic diversity of 12 isolated populations of Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi located on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, USA. Length-structured integral projection models (IPMs) were used to project population growth rate (lambda) and its sensitivity to underlying vital rates and parameters. We examined relationships between lambda, genetic diversity, and habitat size and quality. Lambda ranged from 0.68 to 1.1 with 10 of 12 populations projected to be in decline. A sensitivity analysis of lambda with respect to projection matrix elements indicated that lambda was generally sensitive to changes in early life history stages (survival/growth), but patterns differed among populations. Another sensitivity analysis with respect to underlying model parameters showed highly consistent pattern across populations, with lambda being most sensitive to the slope of probability of maturity (estimated from published literature), generally followed by adult survival, and the slope of somatic growth rate (directly measured from each population). Lambda was not correlated with genetic diversity. For populations residing in small isolated streams (<= 5 km of occupied habitat), lambda significantly increased with base flow discharge (r(2) = 0.50, p < 0.02). Our results highlight the potential importance of local adaptation for persistence of small, isolated populations. Specifically we saw evidence for higher probability of maturity at smaller sizes in the smallest, coldest isolated systems, increasing probability of persistence for these populations. Climate change threatens tofurther fragment populations of aquatic organisms and reduce summertime base flows in much of western North America. Insights from studies such as ours will inform management strategies for long-term persistence of species facing these challenges. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The material was collected with a Bongo net (505 mu m mesh), during summer 1992. The Laird-Gompertz growth model was selected over other models because it offered the best approach to the determination of hatching size and gave the highest correlation coefficients. The instantaneous mortality rate for all three species was estimated from the exponential model of decreasing abundance of each (1.0 mm) age class. The entire digestive tract was removed from larval specimens in order to identify and quantify its content. The larval size range analysed, and the estimated hatching sizes from the model were 1.52-7.88 mm and 1.21 mm, 1.51-8.82 mm and 0.82 mm and 1.33-6.49 mm and 0.91 mm for Stellifer lanceolaters, Cynoscion arenarius and Cynoscion nothus, respectively. The growth rate decreased from 10.3% on day 1 to 4.6% on day 27 for S, lanceolatus, 20.1% on day 1 to 3.0% on day 28 for C. arenarius and from 14.5% on day 1 to 72 on day 20 for C. nothus. The instantaneous mortality rates were 0.20, 0.17 and 0.25 for S. lanceolatus, C. arenarius and C. nothus, respectively. The small hatching sizes recorded in the study may be due to the relatively high summer water temperatures (>30 degrees C) in the Southern Gulf of Mexico.Hatching sizes are similar to some non-sciaenid species from the Southern Gulf of Mexico. High mortality rate (0.20) of S. lanceolatus is related to the highest larval density (2.176 larvae 100 m(-3)) and the lowest average growth rate (7.0%). Copepods were the main larval food item for ail three species; there were also relatively high percentages of pelecypods in small S. lanceolatus larvae. Very few specimens simultaneously had two different kinds of prey, which could be a consequence of the patchy distribution of prey. The low proportion of empty digestive tracts suggests that there was a good food supply during that summer. (C) 1998 Academic Press.									6	0	0	0	7	1	8			0272-7714	1096-0015		WOS:000077018300005

Recent analyses linking phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) revealed a paradox. Despite large increases in mussel recruitment beginning in 2000, adult mussel responses were idiosyncratic by site and intertidal zone, with no response at one long-term site, and increases in the low zone (1.5% per year) and decreases in the mid zone (1.3% per year) at the other. What are the mechanisms underlying these differential changes? Species interactions such as facilitation by barnacles and predation are potential determinants of successful mussel colonization. To evaluate these effects, we analyzed patterns of barnacle recruitment, determined if predation rate covaried with the increase in mussel recruitment, and tested facilitation interactions in a field experiment. Neither magnitude nor season of barnacle recruitment changed meaningfully with site or zone from the 1990s to the 2000s. In contrast to the relationship between NPGO and local-scale mussel recruitment, relationships between local-scale patterns of barnacle recruitment and climate indices were weak. Despite differences in rates of prey recruitment and abundance of sea stars in 1990-1991, 1999-2000, and 2007=2008, predation rates were nearly identical in experiments before, during, and after 1999-2000. The facilitation experiment showed that mussels M. trossulus only became abundant when barnacle recruitment was allowed, when abundance of barnacles reached high abundance of similar to 50% cover, and when mussel recruitment was sufficiently high. Thus, in the low zone minimal changes in mussel abundance despite sharply increased recruitment rates are consistent with the hypothesis that change in adult mussel cover was buffered by the relative insensitivity of barnacle recruitment to climatic fluctuations, and a resultant lack of change in facilitation strength. Facilitation of mussels is likely important in the mid zone as well, but the dynamics of the longer-lived M. californianus at our two long-term sites appeared to be driven primarily by differential regimes of disturbance. Although rocky intertidal ecosystems may be sensitive to major climatic perturbations, predicting community responses will be difficult due to complex individualistic responses of key taxa during the recruitment stage and their influences on subsequent species interactions.									21	0	0	0	18	0	21			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000293457300006

In a climate change context, increased warming and dryness will likely affect arthropod communities of agro-ecosystems managed by biological pest control. In this work, we compare, at the individual level, the functional relation between temperature and relative humidity and different life-history parameters in two sister predatory mite species that inhabit Spanish avocado crops, Euseius stipulatus and E. scutalis (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). We found that negative effects of high temperature and low relative humidity were stronger in E. stipulatus than in E. scutalis. That E. scutalis tolerates very well hot and dry environments makes the species a good candidate to be considered in the future as a biocontrol agent against pests in subtropical and Mediterranean orchards.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000437121600011

The gradient in pond canopy cover strongly influences freshwater species distributions. This study tested the effects of canopy cover on the performance of two species of larval anurans, a canopy cover generalist (Rana sylvatica, the wood frog) and an open-canopy specialist (R. pipiens, the leopard frog), and tested which factors co-varying with canopy cover mediate these effects.2. A field transplant experiment demonstrated that canopy cover had negative performance effects on both species. However, leopard frogs, which grow faster than wood frogs in open-canopy ponds, were more strongly affected by closed-canopy pond conditions.3. Closed-canopy ponds had lower temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and food nutritional quality as indicated by carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C : N) analysis of field-sampled food types, and of gut contents of transplanted larvae.4. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that higher temperature and food quality but not DO substantially increased larval growth. However, only food quality increased growth rates of leopard frogs more than wood frogs.5. The strong correlation of growth rates to gut content C : N in the field, and the similarity of growth curves as a function of resource quality in the field and laboratory, strongly suggest that resources are of primary importance in mediating intraspecific, and especially interspecific differences in performance across the canopy cover gradient.									82	0	0	0	77	2	83			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000235331600002		
J	Barton, Brandon T.								Reduced wind strengthens top-down control of an insect herbivore								ECOLOGY				95	9			2375	2381		10.1890/13-2171.1				SEP 2014	2014	Global wind speeds have decreased 5-15% over the last 30 years and are expected to continue decreasing in the future. However, little is known about how wind affects species and their interactions within communities. I experimentally tested the effects of wind on predator-prey interactions using soybean aphids and predatory multicolored Asian ladybeetles. First, I examined the direct effect of wind on aphids in a greenhouse without predators under three treatments: no wind, wind (oscillating fan), or simulated wind movement. Aphid abundances did not differ among treatments. Next, I conducted a field experiment in soybean plots assigned to either control or wind-block treatments. Predators were more abundant in wind-block treatments and reduced aphid abundance by 40% compared to control plots. To elucidate why wind indirectly increased aphid density in open plots, I conducted a feeding trial with ladybeetles foraging for aphids on plants that were assigned to either control or simulated wind movement treatments. Plant movement doubled the amount of time it took predators to begin consuming aphids and decreased predation rate by two-thirds. These experiments illustrate how wind can have indirect effects on prey by altering predator behavior and show the importance of this under-studied effect of global change.									19	0	0	0	16	0	19			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000342340200002		
J	Kruse, Peter Dalgas; Toft, Soren; Sunderland, Keith D.								Temperature and prey capture: opposite relationships in two predator taxa								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				33	2			305	312		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00978.x				APR 2008	2008	1. All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey.2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey.3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C).4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons. The ability of many carabid beetles to forage at low temperatures may have nutritional benefits and increases the diversity of interactions in terrestrial food webs.									41	0	0	0	40	0	41			0307-6946			WOS:000253710000019

Especially interactions between successive stressors are poorly understood and recently suggested to depend on their timing of exposure. We particularly need studies assessing the impact of exposure to relevant stressors at various life stages and how these interact. We investigated the single and combined impacts of a heat wave (mild [25 degrees C] and extreme [30 degrees C]) during the egg stage, followed by successive exposure to esfenvalerate (ESF) and a heat wave during the larval stage in damselflies. Each stressor caused mortality. The egg heat wave and larval ESF exposure had delayed effects on survival, growth and lipid peroxidation (MDA). This resulted in deviations from the prediction that stressors separated by a long time interval would not interact: the egg heat wave modulated the interaction between the stressors in the larval stage. Firstly, ESF caused delayed mortality only in larvae that had been exposed to the extreme egg heat wave and this strongly depended upon the larval heat wave treatment. Secondly, ESF only increased MDA in larvae not exposed to the egg heat wave. We found little support for the prediction that when there is limited time between stressors, synergistic interactions should occur. The intermediate ESF concentration only caused delayed mortality when combined with the larval heat wave, and the lowest ESF concentrations only increased oxidative damage when followed by the mild larval heat wave. Survival selection mitigated the interaction patterns between successive stressors that are individually lethal, and therefore should be included in a predictive framework for the time-scale dependence of the outcome of multistressor studies with pollutants. The egg heat wave shaping the interaction pattern between successive pesticide exposure and a larval heat wave highlights the connectivity between the concepts of 'heat-induced pesticide sensitivity' and 'pesticide-induced heat sensitivity'.

Prey selectivity data are often of limited use for predicting future consumptive interactions because they are specific to the identity and relative abundance of species in past assemblages. Here, we investigate whether the strength of consumptive interactions can be predicted based on a priori knowledge of behavioral traits that are hypothesized to affect the predation process and recur across species. To test this approach, we conducted multi-species foraging trials with coral-reef fishes in the Bahamas, a diverse, traitrich fauna for which interactions are likely shifting rapidly due to the introduction of predatory Indo-Pacific lionfish. We evaluated predictions about the combined effects of three behavioral traits-water column position of both predator and prey, anti-predator aggregation behavior of prey, and hunting strategy of predators-on successive phases of the predation process and ultimately the strength of predator-prey interactions. Tracking predator and prey behaviors revealed that inter-specific variation in traits mediated relative encounter, attack, and capture rates between different predators and prey. Behaviorally driven bottlenecks at different stages of the process underpinned selective consumption by each predator species, resulting in large differences in total mortality rates among prey species. Our analysis also suggests that unique behaviors exhibited by invasive lionfish, rather than na_ ive responses by prey, mediate their high foraging success relative to native predators. Our results illustrate how incorporating a priori knowledge about foraging and anti-predator traits can improve predictions of the strength of emergent consumptive interactions caused by global change.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			2150-8925			WOS:000483221900002

Oyashio Coastal Water (OCW) flowed into the bay in late February in 2008, 2010 and 2011, and the mean water temperatures decreased to 1.9-3.1 degrees C in March. OCW was not observed in 2009, and it was warm in late February (3.4 degrees C). Increment widths of lapillar otoliths during the yolk-sac stage were wide in 2009 and 2011, medium in 2010 and narrow in 2008. Increment widths during the first-feeding stage tended to become wider as the hatch month progressed, and the annual variation during the first-feeding stage was larger than that of the yolk-sac stage. The densities of the primary food for the larvae were high in 2008 when larval increment widths were narrowest, so the effect of prey abundance on larval growth appeared to be small. The ranking of the larval abundance in March was nearly coincident with that of the increment width during the larval stage. We, therefore, suggest that the larval growth rate is associated with the mortality rate and that the growth-mortality hypothesis may be applicable to walleye pollock in Funka Bay. Feeding success under warm water conditions may be an important factor that contributes towards high growth rates.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000358673700002

One such species, the Northwest Atlantic harp seal, gives birth on ice and feeds along the southern edge of the seasonal pack ice. Unfortunately, little is known about the impact of climate change on ice-dependent species in sub-Arctic areas, although they are areas of rapid ecosystem change. While climate change has been shown to affect harp seals directly through increased mortality of young, it may also impact indirectly through changes in prey and subsequent reproductive rates. Over the past four decades, harp seals have also undergone a large change in abundance, increasing from <1.5 million seals in the early 1970s to similar to 7.4 million seals today and, since 1987, late-term abortions have been observed. To determine the importance of biological and environmental factors influencing reproduction, pregnancy and abortion rates of harp seals were estimated from samples collected between 1954 and 2014 off Newfoundland, Canada. Since the early 1980s, late-term pregnancy rates among mature females have declined while interannual variability increased, ranging from 0.2 to 0.86. Using a beta-regression model, we found that while the general decline in pregnancy is associated with increased population size, including the rate of late-term abortions captured much of the interannual variability. Changes in abortion rates were described by a model that incorporated capelin biomass and mid-winter ice cover (likely a proxy for ecosystem changes in overall prey abundance). Harp seals appear to respond to relatively small variations in environmental conditions when they are at high population levels. If the observed changes in climate continue, negative impacts on the Northwest Atlantic harp seal population will likely increase due to the predicted warming trend and associated reduction in ice cover.									9	0	0	0	10	0	11			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000371141600009

Less understood are OA's consequences for ecological species interactions. Here, we examine a behaviourally mediated predator prey interaction within the rocky intertidal zone of the temperate eastern Pacific Ocean, using it as a model system to explore OA's capacity to impair invertebrate anti-predator behaviours more broadly. Our system involves the iconic sea star predator, Pisaster ochraceus, that elicits flee responses in numerous gastropod prey. We examine, in particular, the capacity for OA-associated reductions in pH to alter flight behaviours of the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis, an often abundant and well-studied grazer in the system. We assess interactions between these species at 16 discrete levels of pH, quantifying the full functional response of Tegula under present and near-future OA conditions. Results demonstrate the disruption of snail anti-predator behaviours at low pH, with decreases in the time individuals spend in refuge locations. We also show that fluctuations in pH, including those typical of rock pools inhabited by snails, do not materially change outcomes, implying little capacity for episodically benign pH conditions to aid behavioural recovery. Together, these findings suggest a strong potential for OA to induce cascading community-level shifts within this long-studied ecosystem.									32	1	0	0	28	0	32			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000381247300003	27358371

However, risks associated with dietary specialization may be offset by increased performance when feeding on preferred prey. Although rarely demonstrated, highly specialized species are expected to outperform generalists when feeding on their preferred prey, whereas generalists are predicted to have more similar performance across a range of different prey. To test this theory, we compared the growth rates of two obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes (Chaetodon trifascialis and Chaetodon plebeius) maintained on exclusive diets of preferred vs nonpreferred prey. In the field, C. trifascialis was the most specialized species, feeding almost exclusively on just one coral species, Acropora hyacinthus. C. plebeius meanwhile, was much less specialized, but fed predominantly on Pocillopora damicornis. During growth experiments, C. trifascialis grew fastest when feeding on A. hyacinthus and did not grow at all when feeding on less preferred prey (P. damicornis and Porites cylindrica). C. plebeius performed equally well on both A. hyacinthus and P. damicornis (its preferred prey), but performed poorly when feeding on P. cylindrica. Both butterflyfishes select coral species that maximize juvenile growth, but contrary to expectations, the more specialized species (C. trifascialis) did not outperform the generalist species (C. plebeius) when both consumed their preferred prey. Increased dietary specialization, therefore, appears to be a questionable strategy, as there was no evidence of any increased benefits to offset increases in susceptibility to disturbance.									69	1	0	0	68	0	70			0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000254177600014

Elliott, Kyle/S-9185-2019				Seabird diet changes in northern Hudson Bay, 1981-2013, reflect the availability of schooling prey								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				513				211	223		10.3354/meps10945				OCT 22 2014	2014	Ongoing climate change is altering Arctic marine ecosystems with major consequences for food-webs. Seabirds, by foraging over large marine areas but returning regularly to their breeding colonies, provide a good medium for tracking such changes. We studied the prey delivered to nestling thick-billed murres Uria lomvia at a colony in northern Hudson Bay, Canada, over the period 1981-2013. During that period, ice conditions in the region altered substantially, with earlier break-up and clearance. This change was not gradual but mainly occurred in the mid-1990s. Breeding chronology also advanced, but not as fast as early summer ice clearance advanced. Ice conditions strongly affected diet, presumably reflecting the change in the timing of breeding relative to ice clearance. Of the dominant species in the diet, the proportion of Arctic cod Boreogadus saida decreased and the proportion of capelin Mallotus villosus increased over the 33 yr period, even after ice effects were taken into account, suggesting a progressive and cumulative effect of environmental change on the marine community. Those cumulative changes were manifested primarily in the diet representation of the most frequent taxa (cod and capelin), with variation in secondary diet components being driven by the availability of the dominant taxa. Diet diversity, representing an increase in the proportion of benthic fish (stichaeids, zoarcids, pholids and sculpins) and invertebrates (squid, amphipods and crustaceans), increased when ice cover was low, and hatching was late relative to ice break-up. Chick growth rates were low when the proportion of benthic fish was high. Hence, although it appears that growth rates are influenced by diet composition, it is more likely that they reflect the availability of the dominant schooling prey species, rather than any nutritional deficiency in benthic species.									18	0	0	0	16	0	18			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000344394400017

I tested the hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced reproduction and dispersal. This study provides a framework to understand links between ecological and physiological traits underlying post-fire population dynamics.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000419477800014	29167982

Rotifers, an important and cosmopolitan group of zooplankton in freshwater, were used in our study. We investigated the effect of temperature (20, 23, and 30A degrees C) and of photoperiod (L:D = 12:0 and 0:12) on the predatory rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli consuming rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as prey. Under A. brightwelli predation, populations of B. calyciflorus prey were consumed more slowly at 20 +/- A 1 and 30 +/- A 1A degrees C as compared to 23 +/- A 1A degrees C. Prey consumption by A. brightwelli increased from 0.63 +/- A 0.09 ind. predator(-1) at 20A degrees C to a peak of 1.22 +/- A 0.12 ind. predator(-1) at 23A degrees C, then decreased significantly to 0.93 +/- A 0.14 ind. predator(-1) at 30 +/- A 1A degrees C. In addition, predation responded to temperature changing sensitively and rapidly. Statistical analysis showed that the prey consumption were significant different under altered temperature periods during 12 h. Photoperiod also significantly influenced the rate of A. brighwelli predation. B. calyciflorus suffered less predation in darkness than in light. The rate of prey consumption in light (1.06 ind. predator(-1)) was twice the average of that in darkness (0.51 ind. predator(-1)). Furthermore, predation rate varied under changing photoperiod but predators moved back into the light did not resume their original consumption rate. Our results demonstrate that whether the predation in rotifer successfully or not is strongly influenced by temperature and photoperiod.									9	2	0	0	7	0	11			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000282179900005

The goals of this study were to measure and explain large-scale spatial and temporal patterns of phenotypic variation in size at metamorphosis of the mayfly, Baetis bicaudatus (Baetidae), from habitats with variable levels of predation risk. Within a single high-elevation watershed in western Colorado, USA, from 1994 to 1996 we measured dry masses of mature larvae of the overwintering and summer generations of Baetis at 28 site-years in streams with and without predatory fish (trout). We also estimated larval growth rates and development times at 16 site-years. Patterns of spatial variation in mayfly size could not be explained by resource (algae) standing stock, competitor densities, or physical-chemical variables. However, size at metamorphosis of males and females of summer generation Baetis was smaller in fish streams than in fishless streams and decreased as densities of predatory stoneflies increased. Furthermore, overwintering individuals matured at larger sizes than summer generation Baetis, and the size of emerging Baetis declined over the summer, but predominantly in trout streams. Theoretical consideration of the effect of predation risk on size and timing of metamorphosis accurately predicted the observed temporal variation in size and timing of mayflies at emergence in fish and fishless streams. Baetis populations had similar growth rates but followed different developmental trajectories in high and low risk environments. In risky environments larval development was accelerated, resulting in metamorphosis of younger and smaller individuals, minimizing exposure of larvae to risk of mortality from trout predation, but at the cost of future reproduction. In safe environments, larvae extended their development, resulting in larger, more fecund adults, Thus, we propose that large-scale patterns of variation in size and timing of metamorphosis represent adaptive phenotypic plasticity, whereby mayflies respond to variation in risk of predation, thereby maximizing their fitness in variable environments.									154	4	0	0	158	2	164			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000167138200011

Therefore, we conducted this experiment to understand its biology. The laboratory experiments showed that Bdella tropica Atyeo failed to develop at temperatures of 15 +/- 1 degrees C and 35 +/- 1 degrees C, but its development was normal at temperatures of 17 +/- 1 degrees C, 21 +/- 1 degrees C, 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 29 +/- 1 degrees C, and 33 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C, although it could not oviposit at 17 +/- 1 degrees C. The results showed that the development of B. tropica was the longest (115.3 days) at 17 +/- 1 degrees C and shortest (37.4 days) at 33 +/- 1 degrees C, and shortened with increasing temperature within the range of 17-33 degrees C. The survivorship of B. tropica increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 29 degrees C and decreased with increasing temperature within the range from 29 to 35 degrees C. The developmental threshold of temperature of the immature stage was 11.3 degrees C, and the effective thermal summation of immature stage was 843.2 degree-days. The relationships between development and temperature were approximately linear within the range of 17-33 degrees C. These results will help to evaluate the potential of B. tropica as a biological control agent against spider mites.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0164-7954			WOS:000299877700005

Growth rates were lowest before the zooplankton bloom and highest afterwards for both fish species. An index of recruitment potential (instantaneous growth rate, G, divided by instantaneous mortality rate, Z) did not relate clearly to either water temperature or to zooplankton abundance in the case of striped bass but did relate to both factors for white perch. Retrospective analysis of hatch dates in recruited juvenile striped bass from the same year class indicated that later, faster growing cohorts were under-represented when compared to the larval cohort distribution, and that cohorts that co-occurred with high densities of the cladoceran zooplankton Bosmina freyi were over-represented. Comparison of these results with similar analyses from other systems suggests that biotic controls on year-class strength may predominate in estuarine systems where physical factors are relatively damped (Hudson) but may play relatively minor roles in those systems with high physical variability.									48	0	0	0	45	2	51			0090-0656	1937-4518		WOS:000077969500008

In the present study the predation rate of the variegated lady beetle Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) was studied, fed on the black bean aphid Aphis fabae Scopoli under laboratory conditions. The duration of the development of the immature stages and the prey consumption of larval instars were examined under four constant temperatures: 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C. The total larval prey consumption was 158, 164, 192 and 175 A. fabae apterous adults at 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The development of the immature stages of H. variegata lasted 61.7 days at 15 degrees C, 30.3 days at 20 degrees C, 19.0 days at 25 degrees C, and 10.2 days at 30 degrees C. The thermal constant for development of the immature stages of the H. variegata was estimated to 184 degree days and the lower thermal threshold at 13.2 degrees C. The body weight of emerged female adults was 11.09, 11.55, 12.90 and 11.89 (mg) at 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The optimum temperature for the H. variegata as a biological control agent was 25 degrees C. At that temperature, the highest total prey consumption and lowest larval mortality were recorded. These results might be useful tools for the prediction of H. variegata phenology and the interaction with its prey.									3	0	0	0	4	0	4			1721-8861			WOS:000364491800004

However, little is known about how various ecological factors may affect the scaling of respiratory structures supporting oxygen uptake for metabolism. To our knowledge, our study is the first to provide evidence for ecological effects on the scaling of a respiratory structure among conspecific populations of any animal. We compared the body-mass scaling of gill surface area (SA) among eight spring-dwelling populations of the amphipod crustacean Gammarus minus. Although gill SA scaling was not related to water temperature, conductivity or G. minus population density, it was significantly related to predation regime (and secondarily to pH). Body-mass scaling slopes for gill SA were significantly lower in four populations inhabiting springs with fish predators than for four populations in springs without fish (based on comparing means of the population slopes, or slopes calculated from pooled raw data for each comparison group). As a result, gill SA was proportionately smaller in adult amphipods from springs with versus without fish. This scaling difference paralleled similar differences in the scaling exponents for the rates of growth and resting metabolic rate. We hypothesized that gill SA scaling is shallower in fish-containing versus fishless spring populations of G. minus because of effects of size-selective predation on size-specific growth and activity that in turn affect the scaling of oxygen demand and concomitantly the gill capacity (SA) for oxygen uptake. Although influential theory claims that metabolic scaling is constrained by internal body design, our study builds on previous work to show that the scaling of both metabolism and the respiratory structures supporting it may be ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000402407900028	28373596

Although migration to more favourable environments may offer higher growth rates, migrants often experience increased mortality due to predation. Here, we investigated mortality and migration behaviour of the North Sea houting (Coregonus oxyrinchus), an anadromous salmonid endemic to the Wadden Sea. We used acoustic telemetry to map the migration of the only remaining indigenous population by applying stationary hydrophones combined with manual tracking. Data suggested a total mortality of 26%, with 30% of the total mortality attributed to predation by great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), highlighting that North Sea houting conservation could be jeopardised by increased cormorant predation. Risk of cormorant predation was size-dependent, with smaller fish suffering higher risk of predation. The study found North Sea houting to exhibit disparate migration strategies and identified a lentic area in the estuary as an important habitat. Two newly established artificial lakes within the river system significantly reduced the migration speeds, possibly indicating constrained navigation through the lakes. The migration into the Wadden Sea correlated with temperature perhaps indicating osmoregulatory constraints of sea entry. Unlike many salmonid species, migration occurred both day and night. Moreover, fish exhibited repeatable individual differences in diel activity patterns, suggesting that individuals differ consistently in their migratory activity throughout the 24-hr period. Our study provides novel information on salmonid migration, which is crucial for the development of science-based conservation strategies.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000434638800004

In freshwater ecosystems, anthropogenic influences have resulted in acute and prolonged temperature changes which lead to lethal and sub-lethal impacts on the biota that occupy these environments. We assessed the effects of temperature on somatic and otolith growth and development of three species of native Australian freshwater fish (silver perch Bidyanus bidyanus, trout cod Maccullochella macquariensis and golden perch Macquaria ambigua) to simulate how thermal pollution from the release of unseasonably cold water from thermally stratified dams in Australian freshwater ecosystems may impact fish at critical life-history stages. Fish (31 days post-hatch) were exposed to four temperature treatments (13, 16, 20, 24 degrees C) for 30 days. Low temperatures resulted in reduced somatic growth, with no growth observed in silver perch and golden perch held at 13 degrees C over 30 days. Somatic growth was highest at the upper temperature of 24 degrees C. Morphological assessment of fish size reiterated that low water temperatures resulted in reduced body size, particularly in terms of body width and head size. Low temperatures were associated with reduced otolith growth in all species, however a somatic-otolith size relationship was maintained for all species in measures of otolith weight, area, length and perimeter. The sub-lethal impacts observed in our study are likely to manifest at the population level through a reduced capacity of larvae and juveniles to avoid size-dependent predation, a narrower range of prey sources due to extended gape-limited feeding and, ultimately, poorer survival and recruitment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000583123000001

Juvenile charr demonstrated a preference for stream environments, particularly those fed by warm upstream ponds. Charr occupying both stream and nearshore lake habitats were found to feed similarly, with chironomids occurring most frequently in diets. Some older stream-dwelling charr preyed on smaller, younger Arctic charr. Preferred stream occupancy is likely mediated by physical barriers created mainly by water velocity, and by distance from the lake, lake-ice dynamics, low water depth, and turbidity. Water velocities resulted in stream habitat segregation by size, with YOY mainly found in low-velocity pools and back eddies adjacent to stream banks, but not in water velocities >0.1 m(.)s-1. Greatest charr densities in streams were found in small, shallow, slow-flowing side channels, which are highly susceptible to drought. Under predicted climate change scenarios, streams fed by small ponds will be susceptible to intermittent flow conditions, which could result in increased competition among juvenile charr for the remaining stream habitats. In addition, glacier-fed streams are likely to experience increased flow conditions that will exacerbate physical barriers created by water velocity and further reduce the availability of preferred stream habitat.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16			0906-6691			WOS:000301282400016		
J	Coggins, Lewis G., Jr.; Yard, Michael D.; Pine, William E., III								Nonnative Fish Control in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona: An Effective Program or Serendipitous Timing?								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				140	2			456	470		10.1080/00028487.2011.572009				MAR 2011	2011	The federally endangered humpback chub Gila cypha in the Colorado River within Grand Canyon is currently the focus of a multiyear program of ecosystem-level experimentation designed to improve native fish survival and promote population recovery as part of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program. A key element of this experiment was a 4-year effort to remove nonnative fishes from critical humpback chub habitat, thereby reducing potentially negative interactions between native and nonnative fishes. Over 36,500 fish from 15 species were captured in the mechanical removal reach during 2003-2006. The majority (64%) of the catch consisted of nonnative fish, including rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (19,020), fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (2,569), common carp Cyprinus carpio (802), and brown trout Salmo trutta (479). Native fish (13,268) constituted 36% of the total catch and included flannelmouth suckers Catostomus latipinnis (7,347), humpback chub (2,606), bluehead suckers Catostomus discobolus (2,243), and speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus (1,072). The contribution of rainbow trout to the overall species composition fell steadily throughout the study period from a high of approximately 90% in January 2003 to less than 10% in August 2006. Overall, the catch of nonnative fish exceeded 95% in January 2003 and fell to less than 50% after July 2005. Our results suggest that removal efforts were successful in rapidly shifting the fish community from one dominated numerically by nonnative species to one dominated by native species. Additionally, increases in juvenile native fish abundance within the removal reach suggest that removal efforts may have promoted greater survival and recruitment. However, drought-induced increases in river water temperature and a systemwide decrease in rainbow trout abundance concurrent with our experiment made it difficult to determine the cause of the apparent increase in juvenile native fish survival and recruitment. Experimental efforts continue and may be able to distinguish among these factors and to better inform future management actions.									48	0	0	0	45	0	48			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000289630100018

Mueter, Franz/0000-0001-6320-4164			Multispecies biomass dynamics models reveal effects of ocean temperature on predation of juvenile pollock in the eastern Bering Sea								FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY				29	1			10	22		10.1111/fog.12433		OCT 2019		JAN 2020	2020	Walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) supports one of the largest commercial fisheries in the world. Juvenile pollock are important forage fish in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) ecosystem, often representing the largest fraction in the diets of major Bering Sea piscivores. Large variability in the EBS pollock stock biomass in recent years has been attributed primarily to fluctuations in recruitment. It has been hypothesized that predation rates on forage fishes increase when the cold pool (a body of cold water < 2 degrees C) is extensive and covers much of the middle continental shelf, which tends to concentrate larger predatory fishes in the outer shelf and slope regions. In contrast, young pollock appear to tolerate colder temperatures than older fish and can stay in the cold pool, thereby reducing predation. We used a multispecies modeling approach to examine the effects of the cold pool size on predation of juvenile pollock. We found that predation on age-1 pollock by age-3+ pollock decreased, and predation on age-1 and age-2 pollock by arrowtooth flounder increased with increasing bottom temperature, which was used as a proxy for the cold pool size. These results suggest that the cold pool creates spatial separation between juvenile pollock and arrowtooth flounder, but not between adult and juvenile pollock. The model developed in this study could be used to examine the effects of other covariates on interspecific interactions, help explain observed changes in fish communities, and understand implications of climate change on ecosystems and their productivity.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000489894600001

The recruitment of Atlantic salmon in Europe								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				66	2			289	304		10.1093/icesjms/fsn210				MAR 2009	2009	The stock complex of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in Europe has experienced a multidecadal decline in recruitment, resulting in the lowest stock abundances observed since 1970. Here, physical forcing, biological interactions, and the resultant growth response of postsmolt salmon are examined with a view to understanding the mechanism controlling recruitment. Sea surface temperature (SST) has increased in the Northeast Atlantic, with the pattern and seasonal change in SST negatively correlated with post-smolt survival during summer and in a region that spatially matches the post-smolt nursery. Constituents of the pelagic foodweb, including potential postsmolt food and plankton that may affect post-smolt forage, have changed on a decadal scale and correlate with salmon survival. Retrospective growth analyses of eight stock/sea age components show that post-smolt growth during summer is positively correlated with salmon survival and recruitment. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation appears to be a more closely aligned climate forcing index than the North Atlantic Oscillation with respect to salmon recruitment. European Atlantic salmon recruitment appears to be governed by factors that affect the growth of post-smolts during their first summer at sea, including SST and forage abundances; growth appears to mediate survival by the functional relationship between post-smolts and their predators.									111	0	0	0	106	0	112			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000263164000008

Diet composition and resource partitioning in two small flatfish species in the German Bight								JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				66	3			195	204		10.1016/j.seares.2011.06.003				OCT 2011	2011	Since the late 1980s, the small-sized non-commercial flatfish species solenette (Buglossidium luteum) and scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) have increased in abundance in the southern North Sea. Because these species are considered as possible competitors for prey of commercial flatfish, this study aimed at advancing knowledge of their feeding ecology.Between January 2009 and January 2010 stomach contents of solenette and scaldfish and benthic infauna were sampled seasonally in a study area in the German Bight. The objectives were to investigate the seasonal variability of feeding activity and diet composition of both flatfish species related to benthic prey availability. For both flatfish, the highest feeding activity was found in summer, at the same time that the highest prey densities occurred in the study area. A reduced feeding activity was observed during the winter of 2010, but not in the winter of 2009, probably related to higher 2009 water temperatures.In all seasons, diet composition of solenette was dominated by meiofauna, mainly harpacticoid copepods. Macrofauna prey species, namely juveniles of bivalves and echinoderms became important in spring. An increase in amphipods and cumaceans was found in the stomach contents during summer and autumn, simultaneously with their increased abundance in the benthic infauna. In contrast, polychaetes were rarely found in the diet, but dominated the infauna during all seasons.Diet composition of scaldfish was dominated by larger and mobile prey, and, during all seasons, was mainly comprised of crustaceans. Amphipods characterised the diet in both winters, while decapods such as Crangon spp. and Liocarcinus spp. were the dominant prey from spring to autumn. Additionally, juveniles of flatfish (Pleuronectids) and bivalves were found in the scaldfish diet in spring, replaced by cumaceans in summer. No dietary overlap between both flatfish species was found across seasons, indicating partitioning of prey resources between solenette and scaldfish. Their different feeding strategies and prey preferences, in turn were influenced by the seasonal variability of available prey. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental variability is a major determinant of reef ecosystem structure and function, including coral reef extent and growth rates, and the abundance, diversity, and morphology of reef organisms. Proper characterization of environmental forcings on coral reef ecosystems is critical if we are to understand the dynamics and implications of abiotic-biotic interactions on reef ecosystems. This study combines high-resolution bathymetric information with remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and irradiance data, and modeled wave data to quantify environmental forcings on coral reefs. We present a methodological approach to develop spatially constrained, island-and atoll-scale metrics that quantify climatological range limits and anomalous environmental forcings across U. S. Pacific coral reef ecosystems. Our results indicate considerable spatial heterogeneity in climatological ranges and anomalies across 41 islands and atolls, with emergent spatial patterns specific to each environmental forcing. For example, wave energy was greatest at northern latitudes and generally decreased with latitude. In contrast, chlorophyll-a was greatest at reef ecosystems proximate to the equator and northern-most locations, showing little synchrony with latitude. In addition, we find that the reef ecosystems with the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations; Jarvis, Howland, Baker, Palmyra and Kingman are each uninhabited and are characterized by high hard coral cover and large numbers of predatory fishes. Finally, we find that scaling environmental data to the spatial footprint of individual islands and atolls is more likely to capture local environmental forcings, as chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased at relatively short distances (>7 km) from 85% of our study locations. These metrics will help identify reef ecosystems most exposed to environmental stress as well as systems that may be more resistant or resilient to future climate change.									65	0	0	0	56	0	65			1932-6203			WOS:000317908700069	23637939	
J	Gray, Derek K.; Arnott, Shelley E.					Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X			The role of dispersal levels, Allee effects and community resistance as zooplankton communities respond to environmental change								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				49	6			1216	1224		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02203.x				DEC 2012	2012	Worldwide, freshwater zooplankton communities have been subjected to multiple environmental stressors including acidification, invasive species introductions, habitat alteration and climate change. Understanding the factors that affect zooplankton community responses in the face of environmental change is an important goal if ecologists expect to make predictions regarding the impact of current and future stressors. The acidification and recovery of lakes provides a well-studied example of the impacts of environmental change. For this study, we conducted a field enclosure experiment using zooplankton communities that are recovering from the effects of acidification to determine whether dispersal levels, Allee effects and biotic interactions could influence com`munity responses as pH levels increase. The experiment involved the introduction of four acid-sensitive colonist species (Daphnia retrocurva, Skistodiaptomus oregonensis, Epischura lacustris and Tropocyclops extensus) into enclosures stocked with recipient communities. The experiment was a factorial design with colonists introduced at three starting densities (low, medium and high) and enclosures being stocked with either diverse communities typical of neutral lakes or relatively depauperate communities dominated by the acid-tolerant copepod Leptodiaptomus minutus. Per capita growth rates (r) for colonist species were measured by sampling communities in enclosures over a 10-week period. Factorial anovas were conducted to determine whether r differed according to starting densities, recipient community type or their interaction. Our results indicated that r for the copepods E. lacustris and S. oregonensis were greater when introduced at high initial densities, suggesting an Allee effect based on mate limitation. In addition, r for S. oregonensis was lower when introduced to acid communities, suggesting biotic interactions with the resident community were important for this species. Per capita growth rates for T. extensus and D. retrocurva did not differ among treatments. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that community response to environmental change can be influenced by dispersal, Allee effects and community interactions. Studies evaluating the ongoing recovery of zooplankton communities from acidification, or their response to other stressors, should take these factors into account. If rapid community responses are desired, dispersal rates for sexual zooplankton species (copepods) may need to be artificially increased.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0021-8901			WOS:000311855000003

Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of 'sport fishing' (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose design principles. Five prerequisite principles for the success of sport fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise. These should include improvements in income, health, education, food security, the status of the target and non-target species and their habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing. Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing enterprises in the Pacific. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Over 16 days all measures of survival, growth, and production were more favourable at each higher temperature in the 15-25 degrees C range. More favourable responses were also obtained at the higher prey level (500 v. 50 Artemia nauplii l(-1)) and at the higher pH (7.5 v. 6.5). Combinations of high temperature and high prey levels, at pH 7.5, led to highest larval production. Little growth or production occurred at 15 degrees C, regardless of pH or prey level. The effect of pH was strong with respect to survival, but weak with respect to growth. In attempts to restore American shad populations by larval stocking, release times and sites can be critical to optimize survival and eventual returns. Releases of larvae potentially will be most effective when made at temperatures >20 degrees C, pH > 7.0, and prey levels > 50 l(-1). These conditions are most likely to occur in Maryland tributaries of Chesapeake Bay between mid-May and early June.

Here, we test for a relationship between oceanographic habitat suitability and the body condition of kingfish (Seriola lalandi) from eastern Australia. We (a) test whether individuals sampled from areas of high-quality habitat were in better condition than individuals sampled from areas of low-quality habitat, and (b) assess whether the condition of kingfish responded to oceanographic habitat suitability predicted at varying time-before-capture periods. Kingfish habitat was modelled as a function of sea surface temperature, sea-level anomaly and eddy kinetic energy in a generalized additive modelling framework. Model predictions were made over one- to six-week time-before-capture periods and compared to field-derived kingfish condition data measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Oceanographic habitat suitability was significantly correlated with kingfish condition at time-before-capture periods ranging from one to four weeks and became increasingly correlated at shorter lead-times. Our results highlight that (a) fish condition can respond sensitively to environmental variability and this response can be detected using oceanographic habitat suitability models, and (b) climate change may drive extensions in species range limits through spatial shifts in oceanographic habitat quality that allow individuals to persist beyond historical range boundaries without their body condition being compromised.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000491092200001

Marine predators can be adversely affected by human activities in several potentially interacting ways. Industrial fisheries can affect predator populations adversely through competition for shared prey, and marine environmental change has also been implicated in population declines. In the North Sea, black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla have declined by > 50% since 1990, a period during which a lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus fishery was active and profound oceanographic changes occurred. We studied the role of fisheries and oceanography in kittiwake declines on the Isle of May, south-east Scotland, where sandeels are the main prey.2. Demographic data were collected from 1986 to 2002. We examined changes over time and correlations between population parameters, the local sandeel fishery and environmental factors, and incorporated the results in a deterministic and a stochastic matrix population model.3. Breeding success and adult survival were low when the sandeel fishery was active (1991-98) and were also negatively correlated with winter sea temperature, with a 1-year lag for breeding success. Modelling showed that the observed changes in population parameters could explain the change in population growth rate from +8% year(-1) in the late 1980s to -11% year(-1) in the late 1990s. An observed improvement in breeding success from 2000 onwards has been insufficient to arrest the population decline. To stabilize the population, breeding success must increase to unprecedented levels or survival needs to increase substantially. Stochastic modelling indicated that the population was unlikely to increase if the fishery was active or sea temperature increased, and that the population was almost certain to decrease if both occurred.4. Sandeel recruitment is reduced in warm winters, and we propose that this explains the temperature effects on kittiwake survival and breeding success. The fishery also had a strong effect on demographic performance, although the exact mechanism is unclear as kittiwakes and fishermen target different sandeel age groups.5. Synthesis and applications. Poor breeding success of kittiwakes was associated with warm winters and the presence of a local sandeel fishery. Reversing the trend towards warmer winters may be impossible and, at best, would be a very slow process. Therefore, to safeguard kittiwake populations we recommend that the current closure of the commercial sandeel fishery remain in place indefinitely. This study shows that adequate monitoring of the effect of a fishery or of environmental change on seabird populations needs to include survival as well as breeding success.									222	0	1	0	199	0	231			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000225632800011

This is especially true for sea turtles, which are species of conservation concern. The aim of this study was to conduct a detailed analysis of threats to identify, quantify and prioritize the main impacts to the loggerhead Caretta caretta population in the southwest Atlantic (SWA) region. A matrix of relative threats was constructed. Threats were identified and classified for 8 different life stages (nesting females, eggs, hatchlings, swim-frenzy transitional stage, juveniles-neritic, juveniles-oceanic, adults-neritic, adults-oceanic) and for 3 ecosystems inhabited by sea turtles (terrestrial, neritic and oceanic). Results indicated that fisheries bycatch represents a major threat for loggerheads in the SWA. The trawl fishery was identified as the main source of mortality for neritic juvenile and adult turtles, whereas juveniles in oceanic areas are mostly impacted by surface longlines. In terrestrial environments, eggs and hatchlings are mainly affected by habitat alteration and by native and exotic predators. Loggerheads have shown a positive nesting trend at their main nesting beaches in the SWA, probably due to long-term conservation efforts to reduce mortality of the different life stages within the terrestrial zone. However, the high mortality rates of juveniles and sub-adults documented at some known foraging grounds represent a reason for concern, as this may affect the overall population trend in the future. This threat analysis provides a tool to review the goals of national action plans, prioritize actions and optimize the allocation of management resources.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1863-5407	1613-4796		WOS:000535262100015

The influence of some environmental and biological factors on these trophic interactions, in combination with existent quantitative information, allowed us to evaluate the ecological viability of using a non-ionic surfactant, Genapol OXD-080, to control a plague caused by crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) populations in the rice fields. In the Lower Mondego River Valley, Portugal, G. holbrooki is abundant in rice fields. It feeds mainly on copepods, cladocerans and rotifers. Surface insects, such as aphids, collembolans, adult (imago) chironomids and other dipterans, are additional food. Large G. holbrooki consumed greater amounts of cladocerans and adult chironomids than other smaller size groups, while small fish prefered rotifers. Gravid females ate copepods, cladocerans, and adult chironomids and other dipterans in significantly greater amounts than immatures, males, and non-gravid females. Non-gravid females ate collembolans in significantly greater quantities than any other fish group. The population density of copepods, cladocerans, adult chironomids, and other dipterans, the area covered by aquatic vegetation, and water temperature all had significant effects on the total number of prey caught by G. holbrooki. In contrast, a negative correlation was found with rotifers, collembolans, aphids in higher densities, and of increased water volume, dissolved oxygen and pH. G. holbrooki holds a key intermediate position in the rice field food chain, feeding in large amounts of aquatic invertebrates and being eaten, in rum, by piscivores. With regard to the toxicity of Genapol OXD-080 on non-target organisms, LC50 values for G. holbrooki and some of its main prey were several times lower than the concentration necessary to decrease the activity of crayfish populations in the rice fields. Thus, Genapol OXD-080 could potentially cause greater damage to the local populations of non-target species and should not be used without taking precautions not to contaminate other important biological reservoirs, such as the rice field irrigation channels.									40	6	0	0	37	1	46			0018-8158			WOS:000078947000004

However, assessing the extent of climate impacts on species and their life-history traits requires reliable quantitative statistical approaches. We used a new analytical tool in markrecapture, the multi-event modelling, to simultaneously assess the influence of climatic variation on multiple demographic parameters (i.e. adult survival, transient probability, reproductive skipping and nest dispersal) at two Mediterranean colonies of the Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea, a trans-equatorial migratory long-lived seabird. We also analysed the impact of climate in the breeding success at the two colonies. We found a clear temporal variation of survival for Cory's shearwaters, strongly associated to the large-scale SOI especially in one of the colonies (up to 66% of variance explained). Atlantic hurricane season is modulated by the SOI and coincides with shearwater migration to their wintering areas, directly affecting survival probabilities. However, the SOI was a better predictor of survival probabilities than the frequency of hurricanes; thus, we cannot discard an indirect additive effect of SOI via food availability. Accordingly, the proportion of transients was also correlated with SOI values, indicating higher costs of first reproduction (resulting in either mortality or permanent dispersal) when bad environmental conditions occurred during winter before reproduction. Breeding success was also affected by climatic factors, the NAO explaining c. 41% of variance, probably as a result of its effect in the timing of peak abundance of squid and small pelagics, the main prey for shearwaters. No climatic effect was found either on reproductive skipping or on nest dispersal. Contrarily to what we expect for a long-lived organism, large-scale climatic indexes had a more pronounced effect on survival and transient probabilities than on less sensitive fitness parameters such reproductive skipping or nest dispersal probabilities. The potential increase in hurricane frequency because of global warming may interact with other global change agents (such as incidental bycatch and predation by alien species) nowadays impacting shearwaters, affecting future viability of populations.									34	0	0	0	32	0	34			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000313752300013	22823099

Cutthroat fingerlings decreased as a fraction of the population from stocking in late June to electrofishing surveys in the following October and March. In contrast, the fraction of cutthroat fingerlings among tagged fingerlings eaten by cormorants collected on the river was significantly greater than that in the population when originally stocked. More limited data from pellets regurgitated by adult cormorants at a nearby colony and in American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) collected on the river showed the same trend toward greater percentages of cutthroat trout being consumed than were present among trout stocked. There were no differences in cormorant predation rates on the Eagle Lake strain of rainbow trout reared under shaded versus partially shaded conditions, or between Auburn and Bar BC strains of Snake River (Yellowstone) cutthroat trout. On the North Platte River, cutthroat trout fingerlings were more susceptible to cormorant predation than rainbow trout of similar size that were stocked simultaneously.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0008-4301			WOS:000085324800015

Survival of eggs and larvae was high at 24degreesC and 32degreesC. At 19degreesC none of the larvae survived longer than the first instar, whereas at 21degreesC the number of the larvae completing the immature stage was extremely low. Developmental time was significantly shorter at 32degreesC. Females lived longer at 21degreesC, but no differences were observed at 24degreesC and 32degreesC. Fecundity was greatly reduced at 21degreesC and was higher at 32degreesC. At 21degreesC, the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) reached the minimum (0.0004), and gradually increased with temperature (0.054 at 24degreesC and 0.137 at 32degreesC). At 24degreesC larvae consumed more prey during their development, but at 32degreesC the predation rate per day was higher. For adults both total predation rate and predation rate per day were higher at 32degreesC. The performance of the anthocorid at the various temperatures is discussed in relation to its practical use as a control agent for stored product insects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Aspects like maturity, fecundity, spawning migrations, spawning habitats, onset of spawning, and development time of eggs were reviewed. The onset of maturity is reached at younger age in southern than northern populations due to higher growth rate in the south. Males mature at smaller size and are on average younger than females. Absolute fecundity is closely related to the length and weight, but no clear relationship could be found between relative fecundity and length. Statistically significant relationships were found between the onset of spawning and latitude, and between the duration of the development time of eggs and stable water temperature. Near the southern limits of distribution, the onset of spawning is in February while near the northern limits it is in June. The interannual variability in fecundity and in the onset of maturity and further the factors affecting them have not been studied much. Furthermore, it is not known whether these variations could affect the population dynamics of pikeperch. Little is also known about the actual spawning behaviour of pikeperch in natural habitats. This is probably due to the typical spawning habitats located at 1-3 m depth in waters with high turbidity and low visibility. Even though the homing behaviour to the same spawning areas is well developed in adults, it is not known whether the adults were actually born in the same area.									82	0	0	0	76	0	83			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000182717500001

The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition.2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity.3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales.5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species.6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment.Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.									38	1	0	0	35	2	39			0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000260257800005

Lifespan, growth rate, and body size across latitude in marine Bivalvia, with implications for Phanerozoic evolution								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				283	1836					20161364	10.1098/rspb.2016.1364				AUG 17 2016	2016	Mean body size in marine animals has increased more than 100-fold since the Cambrian, a discovery that brings to attention the key life-history parameters of lifespan and growth rate that ultimately determine size. Variation in these parameters is not well understood on the planet today, much less in deep time. Here, we present a new global database of maximum reported lifespan and shell growth coupled with body size data for 1 148 populations of marine bivalves and show that (i) lifespan increases, and growth rate decreases, with latitude, both across the group as a whole and within well-sampled species, (ii) growth rate, and hence metabolic rate, correlates inversely with lifespan, and (iii) opposing trends in lifespan and growth combined with high variance obviate any demonstrable pattern in body size with latitude. Our observations suggest that the proposed increase in metabolic activity and demonstrated increase in body size of organisms over the Phanerozoic should be accompanied by a concomitant shift towards faster growth and/or shorter lifespan in marine bivalves. This prediction, testable from the fossil record, may help to explain one of the more fundamental patterns in the evolutionary and ecological history of animal life on this planet.									34	1	0	0	25	0	34			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000384274700016	27488653

Humans who use scientific ecological methods can use species such as mollusks that lay down annual growth rings to detect past environmental variation and use statistical models to make predictions about future change. We used traditional ecological knowledge shared by local Inupiaq, combined with growth histories of two species of mollusks, at different trophic levels, to study local change in the coastal ecosystems of Kotzebue, Alaska, an area in the Arctic without continuous scientific monitoring. For the mollusks, a combination of the Arctic Oscillation and total Arctic ice coverage, and summer air temperature and summer precipitation explained 79-80% of the interannual variability in growth of the suspension feeding Greenland cockle (Serripes groenlandicus) and the predatory whelk (Neptunea hero), respectively, indicating these mollusks seem to be impacted by local and regional environmental parameters, and should be good biomonitors for change in coastal Alaska. The change experts within the Kotzebue community were the elders and the fishers, and they observed changes in species abundance and behaviors, including benthic species, and infer that a fundamental change in the climate has taken place within the area. We conclude combining traditional and scientific ecological knowledge provides greater insight than either approach alone, and offers a powerful way to document change in an area that otherwise lacks widespread quantitative monitoring.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8				2296-7745		WOS:000485310600038		
J	Craig, JK; Crowder, LB								Hypoxia-induced habitat shifts and energetic consequences in Atlantic croaker and brown shrimp on the Gulf of Mexico shelf								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				294				79	94		10.3354/meps294079				2005	2005	Seasonal, summertime hypoxia (dissolved oxygen <= 2 mg l(-1)) has occurred over large areas (-1000 to 20 000 km(2)) of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico shelf during several years since at least the mid-1980s, resulting in habitat loss for demersal species. To evaluate the effects of hypoxia-induced habitat loss on Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus and brown shrimp Farfante-penaeus aztecus, we compared species' spatial distributions and relationships to abiotic factors (temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity) across years differing in the spatial extent of hypoxia, Analysis of 14 yr of fishery-independent research trawl and environmental data (July) indicated that hypoxia-induced shifts in spatial distribution result in considerable shifts in the temperature and oxygen conditions that croaker and brown shrimp experience. Croaker, which typically occupy relatively warm, inshore waters, remain in the warmest waters inshore of the hypoxic region but also are displaced to cooler offshore waters. Brown shrimp, which are typically distributed more broadly and further offshore, shift to relatively warm inshore waters as well as cooler waters near the offshore hypoxic edge. These shifts in the species' spatial distribution are reflected in long-term decreases and increases in the mean temperatures occupied by croaker and brown shrimp, respectively, as well as increases in the variance in occupied temperatures for both species. Despite avoidance of the lowest oxygen waters, high densities of croaker and brown shrimp occur in areas of moderately low oxygen concentration (35 to 60% air saturation, 1.6 to 3.7 mg l(-1)) near the offshore hypoxic edge. Because temperature and dissolved oxygen are important abiotic factors that impact metabolic scope, these shifts in spatial distribution during severe hypoxia may impact organism energy budgets. High croaker and shrimp densities near the hypoxic edge likely have implications for trophic interactions as well as the harvest of both target (brown shrimp) and nontarget (croaker) species by the commercial shrimp fishery.									110	2	0	0	96	1	113			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000230387600007

Measurements of metabolic enzyme activity and RNA/DNA have been especially valuable as indicators of condition in studies of marine invertebrates and fishes, groups for which accurate determination of field metabolic rates is difficult. Properly calibrated and applied, biochemical indicators have been successfully used in studies of rocky intertidal ecology, where two decades of experimentation have generated rigorous, testable models for determining the relative influences of biotic and abiotic factors on species distribution, abundance, and interaction. Biochemical indicators of condition and metabolic activity (metabolic enzymes, RNA/DNA) have been used to test nutrient-productivity models by demonstrating tight linkages between nearshore oceanographic processes (such as upwelling) and benthic rocky intertidal ecosystems. Indices of condition and heat stress (heat shock proteins, or Hsps) have begun to be used to test environmental stress models by comparing condition, activity, and Hsp expression of key rocky intertidal predator and prey species. Using biochemical indicators of condition and stress in natural systems holds great promise for understanding mechanisms by which organisms respond to rapid environmental change.									212	6	1	0	198	2	221			0066-4278	1545-1585		WOS:000220827800009	14977401

Pacific halibut reared at 2, 6 and 10 degreesC were fasted for I or 7 days to generate variation in energetic state. The 7 day fast resulted in measurable declines in condition indices at 10degrees and 6degrees C but not at 2degrees C. At 10degrees C, all Pacific halibut consumed the first meal offered, but fish previously fasted for 7 days took significantly longer to locate and consume the meal than fish fasted for only I day. At 2degrees C, Pacific halibut fasted for 7 days did not generally consume the first meal offered, but resumed feeding 2.1 days sooner, on average, than fish fasted for only I day. The gastric evacuation rate of the squid meal was best described by a power model with near-exponential curvature (a = 1.011). The evacuation rate was strongly temperature-dependent (Q(10) = 3-65) but displayed the same degree of variability at each temperature. The evacuation rate in Pacific halibut was not affected by feeding history, body size or energetic state. Furthermore, individual variation in gastric evacuation rate was not correlated with feeding responsiveness at any temperature. These results indicate a general plasticity in the behavioural but not physiological aspects of energy acquisition.

The present paper attempts to establish the role of different hydrological parameters in the formation of plankton blooms and to look for a suitable form of functional response to describe the reduction of zooplankton. population due to toxin producing phytoplankton (TPP). We consider the analysis of variance technique in regression model. In the analysis, first we try to check whether each of the zooplankton species has significant association with any of the physical parameters and TPP as a whole. Secondly, we consider the fact whether each of the zooplankton species has any association with the physical parameters and the TPP individually. Moreover, we propose a modified variance measure for detecting species association, taking into consideration some of the environmental variables and suggested a suitable functional form to describe the toxin production process by TPP population. We then incorporate our findings into a mathematical model and show that a sufficiently large increase in the toxin production rate can destabilize the plankton system's functioning and result in algae bloom.

To understand if fish populations have the capacity to respond to multiple stressors, it is critical to examine interactive effects across multiple biological scales, from cellular metabolism to species interactions. This study examined the effects of CO2-acidification and hypoxia on two naturally cooccurring species, juvenile rockfish (genus Sebastes) and a known predator, cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus). Fishes were exposed to two PCO2 levels at two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels: similar to 600 (ambient) and similar to 1600 (high) mu atm PCO2 and 8.0 (normoxic) and 4.5 mgl(-1) DO (hypoxic) and assessments of cellular metabolism, prey behavior and predation mortality rates were quantified after 1 and 3 weeks. Physiologically, rockfish showed acute alterations in cellular metabolic enzyme activity after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and hypoxia that were not evident in cabezon. Alterations in rockfish energy metabolism were driven by increases in anaerobic LDH activity, and adjustments in enzyme activity ratios of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase and LDH:CS. Correlated changes in rockfish behavior were also apparent after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and hypoxia. Exploration behavior increased in rockfish exposed to elevated PCO2 and spatial analysis of activity indicated short-term interference with anti-predator responses. Predation rate after 1 week increased with elevated PCO2 ; however, no mortality was observed under the multiple-stressor treatment suggesting negative effects on cabezon predators. Most noteworthy, metabolic and behavioral changes were moderately compensated after 3 weeks of acclimation, and predation mortality rates also decreased suggesting that these rockfish may be resilient to changes in environmental stressors predicted by climate models. Linking physiological and behavioral responses to multiple stressors is vital to understand impacts on populations and community dynamics.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			2051-1434			WOS:000438300100002	30018763

Since these ecosystems will likely become increasingly common in the future it is important to know if they can provide food for wildlife. Here we test whether European otters Lutra lutra can have high foraging success in human-made reservoirs. Rhythms of daily activity were studied in a small (365 ha) and shallow (6-15 m) reservoir in NW Spain in which otters show diurnal activity and can be observed directly when foraging. We studied time of permanence in the water and fish catch rate during the period in which water levels were kept artificially low (autumn-winter 2015, 2016 and 2017). Results indicate that otters had at least two peaks of diurnal activity (from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. far from sunrise and from 06:00 to 07:00 p.m. immediately before sunset). Otters spent an average of 74 min (54-94, 95% CI) in the water foraging daily, and had a minimum fish catch rate of ca 600 g h(-1) of small fish. According to a pre-existing theoretical model, otters eating at that rate can satisfy their daily energy requirements with just 1.5 h of daily foraging activity, what roughly coincides with the upper confidence limit of the parameter estimate. When considering as well the capture of large fish otters obtained ca 850 g of fish per day in only 1.2 h in the water. Otters in the reservoir satisfy their daily requirements in autumn-winter with the same time investment than Shetland Island otters foraging during the day on marine fish during the summer. This coincidence is most likely due to the fact that winter water temperature in our study site is similar to that in the Shetland Islands in summer.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0909-6396	1903-220X		WOS:000517761600002

The high mortality commonly observed in, for example, decapod larvae has often been linked to poor nutrition, with most studies focussing on food quantity. Here, we focus instead on the effects of quality and have investigated its effects on the nutritional condition of lobster larvae. We established a tri-trophic food chain consisting of the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina, the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa and larvae of the European lobster Homarus gammarus. In a set of experiments, we manipulated the C:N:P stoichiometry of the primary producers, and accordingly those of the primary consumer. In a first experiment, R. salina was grown under N- and P-limitation and the nutrient content of the algae was manipulated by addition of the limiting nutrient to create a food quality gradient. In a second experiment, the effect on lobster larvae of long- and short-term exposure to food of varying quality during ontogenetic development was investigated. The condition of the lobster larvae was negatively affected even by subtle N- and P-nutrient limitations of the algae. Furthermore, younger lobster larvae were more vulnerable to nutrient limitation than older ones, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in the capacity of lobster larvae to cope with low quality food. The results presented here might have substantial consequences for the survival of lobster larvae in the field, as, in the light of future climate change and re-oligotrophication of the North Sea, lobster larvae might face marked changes in temperature and nutrient conditions, thus significantly altering their condition and growth.									12	2	0	0	12	0	13			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000330734100024	24072442	
J	Vijverberg, J; Vos, M				Vos, Matthijs/B-3802-2009				Predator-released compounds, ambient temperature and competitive exclusion among differently sized Daphnia species								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				51	4			756	767		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01528.x				APR 2006	2006	1. We studied the effects of fish water and temperature on mechanisms of competitive exclusion among two Daphnia species in flow-through microcosms. The large-bodied D. pulicaria outcompeted the medium sized D. galeata x hyalina in fish water, but not in the control treatment. Daphnia galeata x hyalina was competitively displaced 36 days earlier at 18 degrees C than at 12 degrees C.2. It is likely that the high phosphorus content of fish water increased the nutritional value of detrital seston particles by stimulating bacterial growth. Daphnia pulicaria was presumably better able to use these as food and hence showed a more rapid somatic growth than its competitor. This led to very high density of D. pulicaria in fish water, but not in the controls. The elevated D. pulicaria density coincided with high mortality and reduced fecundity in D. galeata x hyalina, resulting in competitive displacement of the hybrid.3. It is clear that the daphnids competed for a limiting resource, as grazing caused a strong decrease in their seston food concentration. However, interference may also have played a role, as earlier studies have shown larger Daphnia species to be dominant in this respect. The high density of large-bodied D. pulicaria in fish water may have had an allelopathic effect on the hybrid. Our data are inconclusive with respect to whether the reached seston concentration was below the threshold resource level (R*) of the hybrid, where population growth rate and mortality exactly balance, as it would be set in the absence of interference, or whether interference actually raised the hybrid's R* to a value above this equilibrium particle concentration.4. Our results do clearly show that fish-released compounds mediated competitive exclusion among zooplankton species and that such displacement occurred at a greatly enhanced rate at an elevated temperature. Fish may thus not only structure zooplankton communities directly through size-selective predation, but also indirectly through the compounds they release.									12	0	0	0	13	0	13			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000236022900013		
J	Coles, Janet J.; Decker, Karin L.; Naumann, Tamara S.								ECOLOGY AND POPULATION DYNAMICS OF SCLEROCACTUS MESAE-VERDAE (BOISSEV. & C. DAVIDSON) L.D. BENSON								WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST				72	3			311	322		10.3398/064.072.0305				NOV 2012	2012	The population dynamics of Sclerocactus mesae-verdae were documented annually in :3 plots over 20 years in southwestern Colorado. Demographic studies of this duration are rare but they are necessary to gain a more accurate estimate of population trends in long-lived desert species. Sclerocactus mesae-verdae was Federally listed is threatened in 1979; this study was initiated in 1986 with the objective of determining whether Colorado populations were growing, declining, or stable. Data collected yearly annual I May included diameter, vigor, and flower/fruit counts for 1629 stems belonging to 659 plums. We used regression analysis to estimate the mean, valiance, and average population growth rate for each plot. Observations made throughout the study suggested that the cactus responded strongly to climatic variables, especially precipitation and temperature, and that 2 of the 3 subject populations were subject to periodic devastation by a longhorn beetle (Moneilema semipunctatum). These observations led us to attempt to correlate significant mortality (beetle-caused) or recruitment events to climate variables. We found that the cactus populations appear to be roughly stable to increasing slightly, possibly due to several wet springs and warmer-than-average winter temperatures since 1992. However, the warming trend also favors beetle predation, which overall presents a concern for the species' long-term survival. We conclude that 20 years may not be long enough to clarify large-scale climate influences on die persistence of long-lived desert species.									4	2	0	0	5	0	7			1527-0904			WOS:000311762700005

Recent modeling approaches advocate the integration of physical and biological processes and the coupling of fully-represented ecosystems. Here, we describe a coral reef ecosystem simulation model (CAFFEE) linking reef cover dynamics, benthic and pelagic production and metabolism, detrital pathways and reef formation processes. The model integrates 27 functional groups with coupled two-way trophic and spatial interactions and includes dynamic adjustment of benthic production and consumption processes. The model is validated with a 40 year time series of coral reef field data from Kenyan reefs responding to two disturbances: fisheries closures and a strong thermal anomaly, the 1998 coral bleaching event. The model simulations successfully replicated a number of patterns observed in empirical data, in particular the progression of communities toward greater calcium carbonate deposition following fisheries closure, and the temporal shift to algal-domination after bleaching events. Further validation of the model was garnered from comparisons of emergent model outputs with ecological ratios commonly used to parameterize comparable systems. The model simulations indicate trade-offs among the organic and inorganic (calcium carbonate) processes in coral reefs whereby fisheries closures promote inorganic production and bleaching disturbances favor the organic production processes of the reef.

We tested this hypothesis in four types of experiments with juvenile rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) foraging on Daphnia longispina in an indoor twin column tank system. In each experiment of the first three types, one column contained one of three types of experimental treatments differing from the control treatment (in the other column) by the following: (i) elevated temperature in the epilimnion, (ii) hypoxia in the metalimnion and (iii) simultaneous elevated temperature in the epilimnion and hypoxia in the metalimnion. In the fourth type of experiment, the gradients of temperature and oxygen concentration in both columns were the same, but prior to the experiments, Daphnia and fish in the control treatment were acclimated to normoxia and, in the experimental treatment, to hypoxia. The results confirmed our hypothesis, since the predation rate of fish was greater in each of the first three experimental treatments than in the control. We did not detect an effect of the acclimation to hypoxia on the predation rate of the fish.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000509465800010	31768081

Thanks to bio-logging, the simultaneous measurements of fine-scale foraging behaviors and oceanographic parameters by predators allow characterizing their foraging environments and provide insights into their prey distribution. In this context, we propose to delimit and to characterize the foraging environments of a marine predator, the Southern Elephant Seal (SES). To do so, the relationship between oceanographic factors and prey encounter events (PEE) was investigated in 12 females SES from Kerguelen Island simultaneously equipped with accelerometers and with a range of physical sensors (temperature, light and depth). PEEs were assessed from the accelerometer data at high spatio-temporal precision while the physical sensors allowed the continuous monitoring of environmental conditions encountered by the SES when diving. First, visited and foraging environments were distinguished according to the oceanographic conditions encountered in the absence and in presence of PEE. Then, a hierarchical classification of the physical parameters recorded during PEEs led to the distinction of five different foraging environments. These foraging environments were structured according to the main frontal systems of the SO. One was located north to the subantarctic front (SAF) and characterized by high temperature and depth, and low light levels. Another, characterized by intermediate levels of temperature, light and depth, was located between the SAF and the polar front (PF). And finally, the last three environments were all found south to the PF and, characterized by low temperature but highly variable depth and light levels. The large physical and/or spatial differences found between these environments suggest that, depending on the location, different prey communities are targeted by SES over a broad range of water temperature, light level and depth conditions. This result highlights the versatility of this marine predator. In addition, in most cases, PEEs were found deeper during the day than during the night, which is indicative of mesopelagic prey performing nycthemeral migration, a behaviour consistent with myctophids species thought to represent the bulk of Kerguelen SES female diets.

Meanwhile, some megafishes have been introduced outside of their native range. A notable example is the European catfish (Silurus glanis), one of the few siluriforms native to Eastern Europe. It is among the 20 largest freshwater fish worldwide, attaining a total length over 2.7 m and a documented mass of 130 kg. Its distinct phylogeny and extreme size imply many features that are rare among other European fish, including novel behaviours (massive aggregations, beaching), consumption of large bodied prey, fast growth rates, long lifespan, high fecundity, nest guarding and large egg sizes. The spread of the species is likely to continue due to illegal introductions, primarily for recreational angling, coupled with natural range extension associated with climate change. Here, the most recent knowledge on the current distribution and the ecology of the species are reviewed. A series of key research questions are identified that should stimulate new research on this intriguing, yet largely unknown, species and, more generally, on the ecology of freshwater invaders.									19	0	0	0	15	0	19			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000425147200009

Social aggregation is a special category that refers to groups that self-organize and maintain cohesion to exploit benefits such as protection from predators, and location and capture of resources more effectively and with greater energy efficiency than could a solitary individual. In this review we explore general aggregation principles, with specific reference to pelagic organisms; describe a range of new technologies either designed for studying aggregations or that could potentially be exploited for this purpose; report on the insights gained from theoretical modelling; discuss the relationship between social aggregation and ocean management; and speculate on the impact of climate change. Examples of aggregation occur in all animal phyla. Among pelagic organisms, it is possible that repeated co-occurrence of stable pairs of individuals, which has been established for some schooling fish, is the likely precursor leading to networks of social interaction and more complex social behaviour. Social network analysis has added new insights into social behaviour and allows us to dissect aggregations and to examine how the constituent individuals interact with each other. This type of analysis is well advanced in pinnipeds and cetaceans, and work on fish is progressing. Detailed three-dimensional analysis of schools has proved to be difficult, especially at sea, but there has been some progress recently. The technological aids for studying social aggregation include video and acoustics, and have benefited from advances in digitization, miniaturization, motion analysis and computing power. New techniques permit three-dimensional tracking of thousands of individual animals within a single group which has allowed novel insights to within-group interactions. Approaches using theoretical modelling of aggregations have a long history but only recently have hypotheses been tested empirically. The lack of synchrony between models and empirical data, and lack of a common framework to schooling models have hitherto hampered progress; however, recent developments in this field offer considerable promise. Further, we speculate that climate change, already having effects on ecosystems, could have dramatic effects on aggregations through its influence on species composition by altering distribution ranges, migration patterns, vertical migration, and oceanic acidity. Because most major commercial fishing targets schooling species, these changes could have important consequences for the dependent businesses.									28	0	0	0	22	0	28			0065-2881		978-0-12-385529-9	WOS:000301675300004	21962752

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				65	5			947	959		10.1111/fwb.13481		JAN 2020		MAY 2020	2020	Browning of waters, coupled to climate change and land use changes, can strongly affect aquatic ecosystems. Browning-induced light limitation may have negative effects on aquatic consumers via shifts in resource composition and availability and by negatively affecting foraging of consumers relying on vision. However, the extent to which light limitation caused by browning affects fish via either of these two pathways is largely unknown. Here we specifically test if fish growth responses to browning in a pelagic food web are best explained by changes in resource availability and composition due to light limitation, or by reduced foraging rates due to decreased visual conditions. To address this question, we set up a mesocosm experiment to study growth responses of two different fish species to browning and conducted an aquaria experiment to study species-specific fish foraging responses to browning. Furthermore, we used a space-for-time approach to analyse fish body length-at-age across >40 lakes with a large gradient in lake water colour to validate experimental findings on species-specific fish growth responses. With browning, we found an increase in chlorophyll a concentrations, shifts in zooplankton community composition, and a decrease in perch (Perca fluviatilis) but not roach (Rutilus rutilus) body growth. We conclude that fish growth responses are most likely to be linked to the observed shift in prey (zooplankton) composition. In contrast, we found limited evidence for reduced perch, but not roach, foraging rates in response to browning. This suggests that light limitation led to lower body growth of perch in brown waters mainly through shifts in resource composition and availability, perhaps in combination with decreased visibility. Finally, with the lake study we confirmed that perch but not roach body growth and length-at-age are negatively affected by brown waters in the wild. In conclusion, using a combination of experimental and observational data, we show that browning of lakes is likely to (continue to) result in reductions in fish body growth of perch, but not roach, as a consequence of shifts in prey availability and composition, and perhaps reduced foraging.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000509968600001

A broad range of disturbance agents affect biological communities indirectly through their modifications to habitat complexity. Individuals that best judge the threat of predation within their environment and can trade-off vigilance against behaviors that promote growth will be rewarded with the highest fitness. This study experimentally examined whether topographic habitat complexity affected the way a damselfish assessed predation risk using olfactory, visual, or combined cues. Fish had higher feeding rates in the low complexity environment. In a low complexity environment, damage-released olfactory cues and visual cues of predators complemented each other in the prey's assessment of risk. However, where complexity was high and visual cues obscured, prey had lower feeding rates and relied more heavily on olfactory cues for risk assessment. Overall, fish appear to be more conservative in the high complexity treatment. Low complexity promoted extremes of behavior, with higher foraging activity but a greater response to predation threats compared with the high complexity treatment. The degree of flexibility that individuals and species have in their ability to adjust the balance of senses used in risk assessment will determine the extent to which organisms will tolerate modifications to their habitat through disturbance.									22	0	0	0	22	0	22			2045-7758			WOS:000326286700015	24324872

Here we examine the stability of urchin barrens by defining the demographics of the Australian urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma during regime shift to, and maintenance of, barrens. Inverse-logistic modeling of calibrated in situ annual growth increments for five urchin populations, two from kelp beds and three from barrens, demonstrate slowing of urchin growth as availability and consumption of standing and/or drift kelp declines. Population age structures were predicted from observed sizes over four years (2012-2015, n = 5,864 individuals), which indicated stable age distributions for populations both maintaining barrens and actively grazing among kelp beds. Younger age distributions occurred on barrens whereas more mature populations existed within kelp beds, indicating that high recruitment facilitates maintenance of barrens while overgrazing appeared more reliant on adult urchins grazing from the edges of kelp beds, as opposed to juvenile recruitment among kelp. Leslie-matrix projections indicated potential for unchecked population growth for all study populations, but which varied depending on whether local or regional recruitment rates were modeled. Ultimately, strong density dependence was observed to check population growth; with high-recruitment/high-density populations offset by reduced growth rates and decreased longevity. Increasing disease rates among older urchins in high-density populations were consistent with observed density-dependent mortality, while tethering of healthy urchins revealed highest predation on small urchins within kelp beds, suggesting some remnant resilience of declining kelp habitat. Results demonstrate that the greatest opportunity for urchin population control is when reefs exist in the kelp bed state, at which point urchin populations are prone to negative feedback. Conversely, control of urchins on barrens is demonstrably difficult given positive density-dependent feedbacks that act to stabilize population size and which evidently underpin the hysteresis effect governing the persistence of this alternative stable state.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000457618800016	30707451

Ecology of scree skinks (Oligosoma waimatense) in O Tu Wharekai Wetland, mid-Canterbury high country, New Zealand								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				43	1					3354	10.20417/nzjecol.43.6				2019	2019	Many of New Zealand's 104 lizard taxa are restricted to the country's main islands where they are vulnerable to a range of threats. Information on population trends and basic ecological data are lacking for most species, hampering conservation efforts. We monitored a population of scree skinks (Oligosoma waimatense; conservation status: Nationally Vulnerable) in an alluvial stream bed in O Tu Wharekai Wetland in the midCanterbury high country over 10 years (2008-2018) to understand aspects of the population's ecology, and to clarify potential threats and options for management. Although there was no linear trend in scree skink capture numbers over this time, an 84% decline was observed following severe and unseasonal flooding in May 2009. Capture numbers recovered over c. 8.5 years in the absence of any species management. Skinks ranged in size from 60-114 mm (snout-to-vent length). Home range size estimates varied from 39.5 to 950 m(2) (100% Minimum Convex Polygons) and their mean size was smaller than those reported for closely-related species. Photo-identification was not sufficiently accurate for long-term individual identification. Threats at our study site include severe flooding, predation by pest mammals, weed encroachment and human interference. Climate change is likely to increase future flood risk to this population and to other threatened species inhabiting the upland reaches of Southern Alps rivers. We recommend: (1) continued monitoring at our study site to assess long-term trends in a flood-prone population of scree skinks; (2) monitoring of four additional populations in scree habitat for 10 years to determine threats and management needs; (3) a survey of Black Jacks Island in Lake Benmore to determine whether the species (last seen there in the 1980s) is still present; and (4) the immediate removal of wilding conifers and other exotic trees from affected sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0110-6465	1177-7788		WOS:000460310400004		
S	Packer, DB; Hoff, T						Benaka, LR		Life history, habitat parameters, and essential habitat of mid-Atlantic summer flounder								FISH HABITAT: ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT AND REHABILITATION		AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM		22				76	92						1998	1998	To satisfy the essential fish habitat (EFH) mandate of the reauthorized Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are developing objective, generic criteria to describe and identify the essential habitats for their managed species. Summer flounder or fluke Paralichthys dentatus is an important commercial and recreational species that occurs from shallow estuaries to the outer continental shelf from Nova Scotia to Florida. It is most abundant within the Middle Atlantic Eight from New England to Cape Hatteras, and this region is the focus of this paper. Summer flounder make seasonal inshore-offshore migrations; adults and juveniles normally inhabit shallow coastal and estuarine waters during the warmer months of the year and mostly move offshore with declining water temperature and day length during autumn. Adults spawn during the fall and winter migrations. The best habitat information available on summer flounder is for the estuarine-dependent transforming larvae and juveniles. They use several different estuarine habitats as nursery areas, including salt-marsh creeks, sea grass beds, mudflats, and open bay areas. In these habitats, water temperature affects the seasonal occurrence of summer flounder, drives the inshore-offshore migration, and, particularly during winter and spring, affects first-year growth and survival and thus subsequent year-class strength. The distribution of transforming larvae and juveniles within the estuaries is significantly influenced by salinity gradients and substrate. Transforming larvae and juveniles show a preference for sandy substrates in the laboratory but also have been captured on mud or mixed substrates. Juveniles are attracted to eelgrass and macroalgae habitats because of the presence of prey but remain in nearby sand to avoid predators as well as conceal themselves from the prey. The MAFMC used the life history and habitat parameter information developed by the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) to precisely describe the EFH of summer flounder by life stage. Because summer flounder are overexploited, the MAFMC wanted to be conservative in its EFH identification. Therefore, 90% of the areas where each life history stage has been collected from offshore surveys were identified as EFH. The MAFMC proposed that 100% of the estuaries where larvae and juveniles were identified as being present be identified as EFH because these life stages are estuarine dependent. Nursery habitats within the estuaries are essential because they provide the best conditions for growth and survival of the transforming larvae and juveniles. Submerged aquatic vegetation beds are especially vulnerable and were identified as habitat areas of particular concern. As more habitat-related density data become available from various local, state, and federal fishery-independent surveys, updated maps of distribution and abundance will be produced.

The study was carried out with adult oysters of similar shell size collected in the Limfjord estuary, Denmark (56 degrees 47'N, 08 degrees 51'E), in November 2011. The feeding traits of both species [clearance rate (CR), retention efficiency (RE) and lower threshold for clearance (LTC)] were compared using five algal species with different cell sizes (5-32 mu m ESD) (Isochrysis galbana, Rhodomonas salina, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Prorocentrum micans and Akashiwo sanguinea). Oysters were acclimated to an experimental temperature of 22 degrees C and a salinity of 25. The CR of O. edulis was one to three times lower than that of C. gigas for the three smaller algal species (5-15 mu m) but not different for the two larger algae. Algae in the size range 7-32 mu m were retained with 100% RE by both oysters, but the smallest alga was retained with reduced RE (similar to 35%). There were no differences in LTC between the two oysters. A closer examination of the relationship between LTC and different measures of the algae present (cell size, cell volume, chl a, C and N) suggests that the LTC, and also the CR, may depend in part on the internal energy status of the oysters.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000392332900006

This device consists in electrofishing frames powered by a direct current generator. A steel plate anode is placed in the centre of the frame whose perimeter is delimited by a closed cathode. The cathode acts as an electric barrier and allows a more precise delimitation of the sampled area. The frame is installed in 5 min by two operators (camouflage of the anode in the substratum). Delays for recolonization of the sampling area by YOY averaged 6.5 min (N = 25) and never exceeded 15 min. The straying and mortality rates of YOY were dependent on voltage used, size of anode and distance anode-cathode (logistic equations; p <0.05; 14 DF). The best compromise was obtained when using a 0.04 m(2) anode within a 2 m(2) frame energetized with 240 V (straying and mortality <5 %). This configuration was tested on 16 sites within a single station. 1,241 YOY (21-66 mm FL) were captured belonging to eight cyprinid species, the most represented species being L. leuciscus (51.04 % of captured YOY). Densities as high as 133 YOY/m(2) were attended in shallow and weakly-sloped nurseries and were significantly (R(2) = 0.972, 14 DF) correlated with water temperature in the sampling site relatively to the thermal gradients in the station. Microhabitat use by YOY is interpreted within the contexts of predation and habitat availability in reduced flows. The consistent results obtained with this new methodology indicate that its precision is relevant for the assessment of microhabitat use by juvenile fishes. Further applications and improvements of the methodology are discussed.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			0003-9136			WOS:A1995RZ82000009

Despite the wide-spread use of amphibians as experimental model organisms, there is a limited understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors affect the variation in metamorphic traits under natural conditions. The aim of our study was to quantify the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on spatial variation in the body size of tadpoles and size at metamorphosis of the European common toad (Bufo b. spinosus). Our study population was distributed over the riverbed (active tract) and the fringing riparian forest of a natural floodplain. The riverbed had warm ponds with variable hydroperiod and few predators, whereas the forest had ponds with the opposite characteristics. Spatial variation in body size at metamorphosis was governed by the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors. The particular form of the interaction between water temperature and intraspecific tadpole density suggests that abiotic factors laid the foundation for biotic factors: intraspecific density decreased growth only at high temperature. Predation and intraspecific density jointly reduced metamorphic size. Interspecific density had a negligible affect on body size at metamorphosis, suggesting weak inter-anuran interactions in the larval stage. Population density at metamorphosis was about one to two orders of magnitudes higher in the riverbed ponds than in the forest ponds, mainly because of lower tadpole mortality. Based on our results, we conclude that ponds in the riverbed appear to play a pivotal role for the population because tadpole growth and survival is best in this habitat.									27	0	2	0	25	0	29			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000278838000009	20204410

Changes in vertical migration of coregonids in response to varying predation risk								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				63	10			2286	2295		10.1139/F06-124				OCT 2006	2006	The distribution of fishes is influenced by a host of physico-chemical and biological variables, including temperature and oxygen, prey abundance, feeding or assimilation rates, and predation risk. We used hydroacoustics and midwater trawls to measure the vertical distribution of pelagic fishes during a series of research cruises on Lake Superior's western arm in 2001 and 2004. Our objective was to assess vertical structuring in the fish assemblage over varying light levels. We observed variability in vertical structuring of both ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) and their primary predator, the siscowet (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet). Our results indicate that deepwater predators and prey migrate extensively over a diel cycle. This migration pattern is most consistent with changes in the distribution of prey resources for siscowet and diel variability in predation risk controlled by changing light levels for ciscoes. The magnitude of vertical migration in ciscoes increased with higher abundance of siscowets, supporting predation risk as a driver of cisco distribution. This study describes the extent of vertical migration in each group of fish, provides a statistical description of the pattern, and discusses the implications for trophic interactions in the Lake Superior food web.									102	1	0	0	93	0	102			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000241585400014

The size and taxonomic grouping were recorded for every zooplankton captured and the relative input of zooplankton of different size classes was determined. The contribution of heterotrophy to animal respiration (CHAR) was calculated using an improved method that included the proportionate contribution of zooplankton from all size classes. Results show that the proportionate effects of species, depth and bleaching treatments on coral feeding rates were not significantly different between ambient and enhanced zooplankton concentrations. Corals captured the same size and assemblage of zooplankton under all evaluated conditions, and preferentially captured plankters smaller than 400 pm. Feeding rates of Porites lobata increased with depth regardless of bleaching status. Feeding rates of Porites compressa increased with depth in non-bleached corals, but not in bleached corals. Within depth, feeding rates of bleached Montipora capitata increased, P compressa decreased and R lobata remained unchanged relative to non-bleached fragments. Therefore, the feeding response of corals to the same disturbance may vary considerably. Calculated CHAR values show that heterotrophic carbon from zooplankton plays a much larger role in the daily carbon budget of corals than previously estimated, accounting for 46% of some coral species' daily metabolic carbon requirements when healthy and 147% when bleached. Thus, heterotrophically acquired carbon made an important contribution to the daily carbon budget of corals under all experimental conditions. These results suggest that the relative importance of autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon to a coral's energetic needs is mediated by a coral's bleaching status and environment, and should be considered on a continuum, from 100% photoautotrophy to 100% heterotrophy.

Understanding the short- and long-term impacts of these extreme events on large-bodied predators will provide insight into the spatial and temporal scales at which acute environmental disturbances in top-down processes may persist within and across ecosystems. Here, we use long-term studies of movements and age structure of an estuarine top predator-juvenile bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas-to identify the effects of an extreme 'cold snap' from 2 to 13 January 2010 over short (weeks) to intermediate (months) time scales. Juvenile bull sharks are typically year-round residents of the Shark River Estuary until they reach 3 to 5 yr of age. However, acoustic telemetry revealed that almost all sharks either permanently left the system or died during the cold snap. For 116 d after the cold snap, no sharks were detected in the system with telemetry or captured during longline sampling. Once sharks returned, both the size structure and abundance of the individuals present in the nursery had changed considerably. During 2010, individual longlines were 70% less likely to capture any sharks, and catch rates on successful longlines were 40% lower than during 2006-2009. Also, all sharks caught after the cold snap were young-of-the-year or neonates, suggesting that the majority of sharks in the estuary were new recruits and several cohorts had been largely lost from the nursery. The longer-term impacts of this change in bull shark abundance to the trophic dynamics of the estuary and the importance of episodic disturbances to bull shark population dynamics will require continued monitoring, but are of considerable interest because of the ecological roles of bull sharks within coastal estuaries and oceans.									42	0	0	0	39	0	42			0171-8630			WOS:000300660600012

Four isolates of Duddingtonia flagrans and one isolate of Arthrobotrys oligospora were inoculated on petri dishes containing either cornmeal agar (CMA) or faecal agar and then incubated for 14 days under three different constant and fluctuating temperature regimes. The radial growth was similar on the two substrates at each temperature regime. All fungal isolates showed a higher growth rate at a constant 20 degrees C. At 10 degrees and 15 degrees C, all D. flagrans isolates showed very similar patterns of radial growth at both constant and fluctuating temperatures. At 20 degrees C, they grew significantly faster at constant than at fluctuating temperatures. A. oligospora grew significantly faster than all D. flagrans isolates except when incubated at a fluctuating 20 degrees C. Spores of each fungal isolate were added to faecal cultures containing eggs of Cooperia oncophora at a concentration of 6250 spores/g faeces. The cultures were incubated for 14 days at the same temperature regimes described above. Control faeces (without fungal material) were also cultured. More larvae were recovered from the fungus-treated cultures incubated at a constant 10 degrees or 15 degrees C than from those incubated at the respective fluctuating temperatures, except for one D. flagrans isolate. Incubation at 20 degrees C showed the opposite effect. The general reduction observed in the number of nematode larvae due to fungal trapping was 18-25% and 48-80% for a constant and fluctuating 10 degrees C, 70-96% and 93-95% for a constant and fluctuating 15 degrees C, and 63-98% and 0-25% for a constant and fluctuating 20 degrees C, respectively.									26	0	0	0	22	1	28			0932-0113	1432-1955		WOS:000081302800007	10431729

Towards the northern edge of species ranges the role of biotic interactions gradually decreases while the impact of climate oscillations becomes more important. This study examined the long-term changes in abundance, individual growth rates and shell shape characteristics of Macoma balthica, one of the dominant species in White Sea soft-bottom intertidal communities. To test the role of predators in changes in clam abundance, we examined the number of moonsnails Amauropsis islandica. Macoma balthica exhibited spatially synchronous population dynamics at six sites in Kandalaksha Bay, where densities of clams varied between 140 and 8500 ind. m(-2) during the 21-year period of observations. Statistical modelling using generalized additive models (GAM) shows that a combination of mild winter and warm summer led to an increase in M. balthica density the following year. Predation by A. islandica had no impact on changes in M. balthica density. Growth rates of M. balthica were higher during a cool decade, but clams that lived in a wanner period were characterized by more globose shells. Our results suggest that the climate oscillations can be regarded as the key factor causing the shift in abundance of M. balthica in the White Sea during the last two decades via recruitment and survival.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0025-3154	1469-7769		WOS:000430473000002

Drought-induced intermittency concentrates aquatic organisms into drying pools. These pools represent refugia from desiccation but apply other stressors, such as extreme temperatures and increased competition for dwindling resources. In the Southern United States, fishes and freshwater mussels are often concentrated together in drying pools during seasonal, summer droughts. This can result in increased competition for food among invertivorous fish, but also increased food abundance for these fish because mussels increase macroinvertebrate abundance. Further, since mussels require fish as hosts for their ectoparasitic larval phase, glochidia, competition with their host during this biologically active time is detrimental to mussels. We conducted an experiment to examine the effects of freshwater mussels on trophic resources and fish survival in drying pools. We stocked mesocosms with juvenile largemouth bass that were infected or uninfected with glochidia and tracked abiotic conditions, trophic resources and fish survival for 10 days. We found that fish survived longer in the presence of adult mussels, regardless of their infection status. We suspect that prey items supplemented by adult freshwater mussels increased the survival of fish. Thus, the presence of adult mussels and the resources that increase in their presence potentially mitigate stress to fish in "ecological crunch times." By conserving mussels, fish populations might withstand droughts more easily.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0906-6691	1600-0633		WOS:000519776100004

Yet, little is known about how aquatic noise affects marine communities. To determine the implications that changes to the soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing on the ramifications of noise on fish behavior and physiology. Our meta-analysis identified 42 studies that produced 2,354 data points, which in turn indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses occurred within foraging ability, predation risk, and reproductive success. Additionally, anthropogenic noise was shown to increase the hearing thresholds and cortisol levels of numerous species while tones, biological, and environmental noise were most likely to affect complex movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest that the majority of fish species are sensitive to changes in the aquatic soundscape, and depending on the noise source, species responses may have extreme and negative fitness consequences. As such, this global synthesis should serve as a warning of the potentially dire consequences facing marine ecosystems if alterations to aquatic soundscapes continue on their current trajectory.									28	0	0	0	20	0	28			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000437281500030	29476641

Occasionally their grazing rates exceed seagrass growth rates, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as overgrazing. Because of a reported increasing frequency of overgrazing events, concomitant with loss of seagrass-associated ecosystem services, it has been suggested that overgrazing is one of the key threats to tropical and subtropical seagrasses. In light of this, we review the current knowledge on causes, consequences. and management of sea urchin overgrazing of seagrasses. Initially we argue that the definition of overgrazing must include scale and impairment of ecosystem services, since this is the de facto definition used in the literature, and will highlight the potential societal costs of seagrass overgrazing. A review of 16 identified cases suggests that urchin overgrazing is a global phenomenon, ranging from temperate to tropical coastal waters and involving at least 11 seagrass and 7 urchin species. Even though most overgrazing events Seem to affect areas of <0.5 km(2), and recovery often occurs within a few years, overgrazing can have a range of large, long-term indirect effects such as loss of associated fauna and decreased sediment stabilization. A range of drivers behind overgrazing have been suggested, including bottom-up (nutrient enrichment). top-down (reduced predation control due to e.g. overfishing), "side-in" mechanisms (e.g. changes in water temperature) and natural population fluctuations. Based on recent studies, there seems to be fairly strong support for the top-down and bottom-up hypotheses. However, many potential drivers often co-occur and interact, especially in areas with high anthropogenic pressure, suggesting that multiple disturbances-by simultaneously reducing predation control, increasing urchin recruitment and reducing the resistance of seagrasses-could pave the way for overgrazing. In management, the most common response to overgrazing has been to remove urchins, but limited knowledge of direct and indirect effects makes it difficult to assess the applicability and sustainability of this method. Based on the wide knowledge gaps, which severely limits management, we suggest that future research should focus on (1) identification and quantification of ecosystem and societal scale effects of overgrazing; (2) assessment of the relative importance and interactions of different drivers; and (3) development of a holistic proactive and reactive long-term management agenda.

A bioenergetic analysis of factors limiting brown trout growth in an ozark tailwater river								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				77	2			121	132		10.1007/s10641-006-9059-7				OCT 2006	2006	We examined prey utilization and energy consumption by brown trout, Salmo trutta, in a cold tailwater (Little Red River, Arkansas, USA; LRR) having low biodiversity and low availability of fish as prey. Stomach content analysis and age estimation were performed on thirty brown trout (10 each of three size classes for a total of 710 trout) collected monthly from an upstream and downstream site over a 1-year period. Diet diversity was low at both sites, as 80% and 70% of all prey consumed by upstream and downstream brown trout, respectively, were isopods. Piscivory (< 0.5% of individuals sampled) and consumption of terrestrial invertebrates were rare. There was no relation between diet diversity and trout age, and a very small ontogenetic shift in brown trout diet. Second, we investigated brown trout growth rates relative to prey consumption and temperature. Temperatures and availability of prey were less than required for maximal trout growth. However, prey availability limited trout growth directly, but sub-optimal temperatures probably buffered the effect of this reduced energy consumption by reducing metabolic energy expenditures. Brown trout growth was 54.8-57.0% of the maximum predicted by a bioenergetics model. Instantaneous growth rates for age 1 and adult brown trout were slightly higher for those downstream (0.195) versus those upstream (0.152). Although isopods are abundant within this tailwater to serve as a forage base, the displacement of native fish fauna and subsequent lack of establishment of cold-tolerant forage fish species due to the thermal regime of hypolimnetic release from Greers Ferry Reservoir probably serves as a major barrier to brown trout growth.									20	0	0	0	21	0	21			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000240362100002

The development of modelling approaches to assess and predict their distributions and impacts, and evaluate management options has increased substantially. We reviewed these modelling approaches, applied in aquatic ecosystems, using a systematic review approach in line with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. According to our results, multispecies/ecosystem models dominated the applications, with dynamic and non-spatial models being the most prevalent. Most of the models included an additional stressor, mainly fisheries, climate change or nutrient loading. The impacts on biota focused on predation, but also on competition and ecosystem functioning, while the impacts on ecosystem services focused on food provision and water purification. At species/population level, most of the studies reported negative impacts; while at multispecies/ecosystem level, negative and both negative and positive impacts were similarly represented. We reflect on the ability of current models to assess different impacts of IAS populations and highlight the need to advance their capabilities to predict future impacts. Further development of models that allow capturing the arrival, establishment and spread of IAS and assess their impacts in an integrated way is still needed. Spatial-temporal modelling techniques bridging with novel analytical capabilities (such as environmental DNA to investigate the presence of IAS and metabarcoding and machine learning to predict future trophic behavior and distributions) may be the key for future achievement.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000515002900005

In the San Juan River, all three species annually produce larvae, but only Bluehead and Flannelmouth suckers regularly recruit to the juvenile phase and older. Otolith microstructure analysis can determine age, growth rates, and spawning periodicity and may elucidate possible reasons for differences in recruitment among species. Larval suckers were collected from low-velocity habitats in the San Juan River in 2011; fish were measured, and ontogenetic phase and fish age were determined from otolith increment counts. Otolith age was used to determine hatch dates and spawning periodicity, calculate daily growth rates, and develop three candidate growth functions relating fish age and body length. Relative to Bluehead and Flannelmouth suckers, Razorback Suckers had a shorter spawning period, lower growth rate, and a higher proportion of the least developed ontogenetic phase. The small size of Razorback Suckers relative to other suckers may result in higher predation and lower prey acquisition, thus restricting their transition to more developed phases and limiting recruitment to the juvenile phase. Model ranking based on Akaike's information criterion (corrected for small sample size) was nearly identical for all growth functions. The early life history information we provide may guide flow releases in this regulated system to provide suitable backwater habitat and warmer water temperatures compatible with reproduction, growth, and survival of native catostomids, including the endangered Razorback Sucker. However, due to the limited temporal and geographic extent of samples used in this study, data presented herein are not inclusive of all conditions under which suckers may be present in the San Juan River.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000523248100001

Much evidence is accumulating that climate change is driving these negative trends in growth rate. Climate-driven changes in the physical environment may affect seabirds both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts such as increasingly common extreme weather events will result in negative physiological responses. However, climate effects on seabirds are more likely to be indirect and mediated by prey quality and availability. Mounting evidence suggests that climate impacts on lower trophic levels are altering the pathway of energy to seabirds. While the basis for changes in primary production are complex and uncertain, climate-driven changes in the availability of sandeels (primarily Ammodytes marinus) and the copepod Ca/anus finmarchicus, key prey species in adjacent trophic levels, appear to be causing a reduction in breeding success and growth rate in several British seabird species.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0078-3218		978-1-4987-0545-5	WOS:000364174100002

The marine-phase (i.e., juvenile life stage) is important yet poorly understood, and is associated with growth opportunities to achieve maximum body size and recruitment. The four goals of this paper are to: (1) synthesize the literature to identify patterns in the marine biology of Pacific lamprey; (2) develop hypotheses to explain these patterns; (3) identify limiting factors and threats, and (4) identify research needs. We hypothesize that recruitment of adult lamprey to spawning populations is influenced by oceanographic regimes through impacts on host abundance. Three marine factors that may be limiting lamprey abundance include: (1) predation and fisheries bycatch; (2) host availability; and (3) host contaminant loads. Four potential marine-related threats to lamprey include: (1) pollution; (2) climate change; (3) unfavorable oceanographic regimes; and (4) the effects of interactions between climate and regimes. Pacific lamprey is not philopatric and the extent to which host migrations and other factors influence lamprey entry into rivers is unclear. Research is needed to fill information gaps on how, when, why, and where lamprey move, feed, and grow in the ocean. Their widespread distribution, parasitic life history, diverse hosts, and multiple predators suggest that Pacific lamprey is integrated into diverse marine ecosystems.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0960-3166	1573-5184		WOS:000517112600003

This problem is difficult due to differences in population responses among closely related taxa. Increased understanding of dynamic relationships between exogenous and endogenous factors will facilitate forecasting and suggest nodes in the life cycle of economically important species susceptible to intervention by managers. This study uses an information-theoretic approach to examine the contributions of weather and density to model population densities and growth rates of nine common grasshopper species from continental U. S. grassland over 25 years. In general, grass-feeding species and total grass-feeders as a functional group were most closely associated with weather during the year before hatching. Increased variability in prior growing season precipitation was associated with increased densities of Mermiria bivittata, Opeia obscura, Phoetaliotes nebrascensis, and the grass-feeding guild. Melanoplus sanguinipes densities tended to be smaller following warm fall seasons, while Amphitoruns coloradus declined during the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation or after warmer than average winters. Population growth rate dynamics of all grouped species combinations were best explained by models including variability in precipitation during the prior year growing season. Large-scale Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) patterns were also associated with growth rate dynamics of the mixed-feeding species group. Density showed a negative relationship with population growth rates of five species. This study indicates the importance of parental and diapause environmental conditions and the utility of incorporating long-term, readily obtained decadal weather indices for forecasting grasshopper densities and identifying critical years with regard to grasshopper management-at least to the degree that the past will continue to predict the future as global climates change.

Trait-specific selective mortality has been documented in the laboratory and field, yet our knowledge of the factors contributing to the existence, strength, and consistency of natural selective mortality is limited. We compiled previously published and unpublished data on the common Caribbean coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum, recruiting to Barbados, West Indies, and the upper Florida Keys to examine how environmental variability during pelagic larval life influences the distribution of early life-history traits exhibited by new recruits. We explored how the scope of variability in otolith-derived traits such as larval growth, pelagic larval duration (PLD), size and condition at settlement, and early juvenile growth influences the degree to which mortality of juveniles is selective. At both locations, contrasting oceanographic conditions (periodic passage of large low-salinity North Brazil Current [NBC] rings near Barbados and seasonal variation in water temperature at Florida) led to significant differences in the early life-history traits of recruits. Mortality was most frequently selective for the two most variable traits, condition at settlement and early juvenile growth. Environmental variability (including variation in predation pressure and stress-inducing conditions) also likely influences juvenile mortality and consequently the degree to which selective loss of particular traits occurs. As we begin to better understand the spatial, temporal, and species-specific circumstances in which events occurring during larval life influence juvenile performance, studies must also be extended to examine how these processes are translated into adult fitness.

Based on literary sources, a description of the distribution and biology of Navaga,Eleginus nawaga,in the White Sea, as well as a history of their fishery, are provided. Long-term changes in biological parameters of several Navaga populations, as well as the current state of the Navaga stocks are summarized. In recent decades, the size and age structure of Navaga populations have undergone significant changes. In Onega and Dvina bays there was a significant rejuvenation of stocks; in contrast, an aging population was observed in Mezen Bay and the Voronka, which was due to climatic changes in all areas of the White Sea. Catches of Navaga have remained at a stable level for more than 100 years, which indicates a stable state of the stocks of this species. Future studies of Navaga in the White Sea should focus on such important aspects as migration, spatial and vertical distribution of juveniles and adults, population structure, biomass and population dynamics, fishing and natural mortality, as well as habitat conditions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000559371200001

Experiments were conducted to determine whether predators would prey on Atlantic sturgeon if alternative prey was available and if the presence of substrate on the tank bottom impacted the number of Atlantic sturgeon consumed. European perch (Perca fluviatilis) was used as the predator, and the alternative prey were three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) or gudgeon (Gobio gobio). The predators and alternative prey were obtained from the wild. The mortality of sturgeon (n = 10) and alternative prey (n = 10) caused by four predators was recorded during 15 min trials. Trials with three-spined stickleback and gudgeon as alternative prey were performed separately. Each experimental trial was repeated five times. The predators consumed significantly more Atlantic sturgeon than alternative prey in both the experimental setups when the bottom of the tank was covered with gravel and stone substrate and when there was no substrate. In trials with three-spined stickleback the mortality of Atlantic sturgeon in both experimental setups was 94 +/- 8.94%, while that of three-spined stickleback in the setup with substrate was 20 +/- 19.23%, and without substrate it was 22 +/- 10.00%. European perch also consumed more Atlantic sturgeon than they did gudgeon, and the mean Atlantic sturgeon mortality in the experimental setup with substrate was 94 +/- 5.48%, while for gudgeon it was 48 +/- 8.37%. In the experimental setup without substrate the predators also consumed substantially more Atlantic sturgeon than gudgeon, with a mean Atlantic sturgeon mortality of 94 +/- 8.94%, while for gudgeon it was 76 +/- 5.48%. The study indicated that hatchery reared Atlantic sturgeon larvae are susceptible to predation by European perch. Predation could impact the survival of juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in the natural environment, and it could be one of the factors that is impeding the restoration of this species in the Baltic Sea basin.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000459917600025		
J	Gwiazda, Robert; Amirowicz, Antoni								TOWARDS THE OPTIMAL FORAGING STRATEGY: IS SEASONAL SHIFT IN THE DIET OF CORMORANTS PHALACROCORAX CARBO (L.) IN A DAM RESERVOIR THE EFFECT OF WATER TEMPERATURE OR SIZE PATTERN IN FISH ASSEMBLAGES?								POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				58	4			783	791						2010	2010	According to optimal foraging theory the prey choice strongly affects the benefit-cost ratios. Predators search prey giving the highest benefit and costs of all components of predation (i.e. prey search, encounter, pursuit, capture, and handling) may be considerably reduced if the prey is more available. The study on Cormorant diet and the species composition of prey fish assemblages in the Dobczyce Reservoir (area 985 ha, submontane, eutrophic reservoir in Southern Poland) in spring (May-June) and in autumn (Oct-Nov) showed differences in the food composition and the prey size affected by seasonal changes in fish availability. The diet of Cormorant included eleven fish species and the dominant species in the food was roach in spring (72%) and roach and perch in autumn (49% in total). Roach and perch had the highest share in prey assemblages too (56% in spring, and 53% in autumn). Significant preference toward roach in spring was found. The share of roach and perch did not changed seasonally and could not explain the change in the composition of Cormorant diet. The range of the total length (LT) of fish in Cormorant diet was 3.5-35.2 cm. Diet consisted of distinctly smaller fish in autumn. Relative number of small fish was ca 3 times greater in this period compared to spring. Weighted mean of fish TL in prey assemblage was 20.0 cm for roach and 12.5 cm for perch in spring, and 11.8 and 8.1 in autumn, respectively. The proportion of average weight of roach (W = 0.004074 LT3.334) to that of perch (W = 0.005779 LT3.260) was greater in spring (4.1:1) than in autumn (2.9:1). Probably it can explain the diet shift in autumn. The switch to smaller but more abundant fish in autumn was not related to temperature but to fish availability which reduced the cost of searching and the prey may be easily found.									5	0	0	0	6	0	6			1505-2249			WOS:000285679100016

The urban heat island (UHI) effect describes the capture of heat by built structures (e.g. asphalt), resulting in elevated urban temperatures. The UHI is a well-studied phenomenon, but only a handful of studies have investigated trait-based shifts resulting from the UHI, and even fewer have attempted to quantify the magnitude of the UHI experienced at the microclimate scale. Here, using a common urban exploiter, the Western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus), we show that the UHI experienced by spiders in July in their urban Phoenix, AZ refuges is 6 degrees C hotter (33 degrees C) than conditions in the refuges of spiders from Sonoran Desert habitat outside of Phoenix's development (27 degrees C). We then use this field microclimate UHI estimate to compare the development speed, mass gain and mortality of replicate siblings from 36 urban lineages reared at 'urban' and 'desert' temperatures. We show that extreme heat is slowing the growth of spiderlings and increasing mortality. In contrast, we show that development of male spiders to their penultimate moult is accelerated by 2 weeks. Lastly, in terms of behavioral shifts, UHI temperatures caused late-stage juvenile male spiders to heighten their foraging voracity and late-stage juvenile female spiders to curtail their web-building behavior. Trait-based approaches like the one presented herein help us better understand the mechanisms that lead to the explosive population growth of urban (sometimes invasive) species, possibly at the expense of urban biodiversity. Studies of organismal responses to the present day UHI can be used as informative surrogates that help us grasp the impact that projected climate change will have on biodiversity.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000532119700010	31490963

Created reef success depends entirely on selecting a location that supports long-term oyster growth and survival, including the recruitment and survival of on-reef oysters. Significant changes in estuarine salinity through management of freshwater inflows and through changed precipitation patterns may significantly impact the locations of optimal oyster restoration sites. These rapid shifts in conditions necessitate a need to better understand both impacts to on-reef oyster growth and population development, and variation in oyster stock performance. Oyster growth, mortality, condition, and disease prevalence were examined in three different stocks of oysters located in protected cages, as well as oyster recruitment and mortality on experimental reef units in three different locations representing a salinity gradient, along the Louisiana Gulf coast in 2011 and 2012. Over a 2-y period, the high-salinity site had highest oyster growth rate in protected cages but demonstrated the least likelihood for reef development based on on-reef oyster population failure, likely because of predation-related mortality (high recruitment and 100% mortality). In contrast, the midsalinity site with moderate oyster growth and on-reef recruitment and low mortality demonstrated a higher likelihood for reef development. The lowest salinity site exhibited extreme variability in all oyster responses between years because of extreme variation in environmental conditions during the study, indicating a low likelihood of long-term reef development. Whereas limited differences in stock performance between sites were found, the range of site environmental conditions tested was ultimately much lower than expected and may not have provided a wide enough range of conditions. In areas with limited, low recruitment, or rapidly changing environmental conditions, seeding with stocks selected for best growth and survival under expected future environmental conditions could better ensure reef development by using oyster populations best suited to the predicted conditions. With rapidly changing estuarine conditions from anthropogenic activities and climate change, siting of oyster reef restoration incorporating both oyster population dynamics and in situ biotic and abiotic interactions is critical in better directing site selection for reef restoration efforts.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000408958300006

Two hundred and thirty-four samples were collected monthly, between July 2000 and June 2001, in the main channel. Seventy-nine species of 29 families were captured with a total estimated mean density and biomass of 1513 individuals ha(-1) and 34 kg ha(-1), respectively. The number of species and total mean density differed significantly among areas and seasons, but the total mean biomass differed only significantly throughout the ecocline (areas) of the Paranagua Estuary. For the most abundant species, the mean densities of Stellifer rastrifer, Aspistor luniscutis, Menticirrhus americanus, Sphoeroides testudineus, Cynoscion leiarchus and Symphurus tesselatus (with the exception of Cathorops spixii and Genidens genidens) differed significantly among seasons. The mean biomass of these species, with the exception of G. genidens, S. rastrifer, A. luniscutis and S. testudineus, also differed significantly for the factor seasons. Area was a significant factor for the eight most abundant species (density and biomass), except S. testudineus (density), G. genidens, C. leiarchus and S. tesselatus (biomass). The season v. area interaction term was significant for C. leiarchus (density). Most of these differences occurred during the rainy season when fishes concentrated principally in the middle of the estuary, where the salinity remained stable. It is suggested that the salinity stability in the middle of the estuary is the main reason why the most estuarine resident fish species move downstream and remain there, regardless of the increased freshwater runoff. Moreover, canonical correspondent analysis output detected that during the late rainy season, the variable dissolved oxygen (P < 0.01) was the most important environmental variable, responsible for structuring patterns of fishes assemblages in the west-east axis of Paranagua Estuary. During the end of the dry season, both salinity (P < 0.01) and dissolved oxygen (P < 0.05) were responsible for this ecological feature in the estuary. Finally, it was possible to detect that juveniles and adults of some important species respond differently to seasonal fluctuations of the ecocline-determining environmental factors. This behaviour is suggested as a strategy to avoid competition and predation during the rainy season in the middle estuary. The Paranagua Estuary did not fit with the pre-existing models described in the tropical and subtropical estuarine fish literature since its main channel fish assemblages remained within its bounds even during the rainy season.

J	Ayre, K								Effect of predator size and temperature on the predation of Deroceras reticulatum (Muller) (Mollusca) by carabid beetles								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE ENTOMOLOGIE				125	7			389	395		10.1046/j.1439-0418.2001.00568.x				AUG 2001	2001	Twenty-one carabid species were used in a laboratory study to determine the effect of beetle size and temperature on the predation of one day old Deroceras reticulatum (Muller) slugs. The beetles were caught in arable land at the study site. None of the five small-sized beetle species killed slugs, whereas five of the seven medium-sized beetle species and eight of the nine large-sized beetle species killed slugs. Four of the most abundant beetle species at the study site were used to assess the effect of temperature on the predation of 1-day-old slugs. There were significant differences in the proportion of beetles predating slugs at the different temperatures. Regression analysis showed that there was a significant increase in the proportion of Pterostichus madidus (Fabricius) and Harpalus rufipes (Degeer) beetles predating slugs as temperature increased. Nebria brevicollis (Fabricius) inflicted its highest level of slug mortality at 8 degreesC and its larvae were the only predators to significantly increase slug mortality at 4 degreesC, the lowest experimental temperature. Harpalus aeneus (Fabricius) inflicted significant levels of slug mortality at 20 degreesC, the highest experimental temperature. It appeared that the predatory activity of these beetle species at the five experimental temperatures reflected their annual activity periods in the field.									24	0	0	0	26	0	26			0931-2048			WOS:000171380700006

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				48	3			383	393		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00995.x				MAR 2003	2003	1. The ultimate explanation for diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is the avoidance of visual predation in surface waters. Studies on migrating zooplankton have shown that remaining in the cold and food-poor hypolimnion during the day, however, has demographic costs. Higher temperatures and greater food concentrations in the surface waters are thought to be the main reasons why Daphnia species move upwards at night.2. In this study, we investigated the growth condition of daphniids raised on seston taken from different depths from a lake with and without a deep-water chlorophyll maximum.3. Juvenile growth rates of Daphnia galeata x hyalina from the lake without a deep-water chlorophyll maximum were similar for all treatments. After temperature correction, however, growth rates were significantly higher on seston taken from the surface layers.4. In contrast, in the lake with the deep-water chlorophyll maximum, D. galeata growth rates were higher in deeper strata, even after temperature correction. Although this lake had a weak temperature gradient, D. galeata left the food-rich strata at night and migrated into the surface food-poor environment. Invertebrate predation and oxygen depletion are probably not the reasons for the nocturnal upward migration into the surface strata. Therefore, we assume that D. galeata migrates upwards to take advantage of higher temperatures. Using several temperature-egg-development models, we could not, however, fully explain this behaviour.									50	1	0	0	49	0	52			0046-5070			WOS:000181027400001

However, little is known about the intra-annual timing and rate of shell growth necessary to interpret such records. In addition, it remains unclear whether actual temperatures can be reliably inferred from delta O-18 values of geoduck {goo'e-duk} shells. This study compared high-resolution nvironmental records (hourly to monthly resolved temperature, bi-weekly to monthly delta O-18(water) and salinity data) with temperatures reconstructed from oxygen isotope values of the outer shell layer (T delta O-18(OSL)) and cardinal tooth portions (T delta O-18(CT)) of different contemporaneous specimens alive at the same locality. Results indicate that shell growth mainly occurred between March/April and November/December with a maximum during May-August. This finding must be considered when comparing the "annual" growth increment width chronologies to environmental parameters. in addition, intra-annual delta O-18(shell) values require the calculation of weighted averages instead of arithmetic means. During ontogeny, the duration of the growing season remained nearly unchanged; an important finding for paleoclimate studies based on inter-annual growth patterns. Seasonal shell growth was strongly correlated with temperature (R=0.93, R-2=0.86, p<0.0001). Presumably due to individual differences in the exchange rate between the extrapallial fluid (EPF) and the ambient water, the outer shell layer of some specimens formed out of oxygen isotopic equilibrium, particularly during summer (high growth rates, increased O-18 depletion of the EPF). This resulted in a T delta O-18(OSL) difference of up to 2 degrees C among different specimens. In addition, a bias was observed in different specimens toward daytime or nighttime temperatures, particularly during summer. Such a bias may be related to individual differences in the physiological activity at ultradian time-scales or to elevated predation pressure. More importantly, CT portions (= inner shell layer) formed in isotopic disequilibrium with the ambient water. Typically, reconstructed temperatures differed by more than 3-4 degrees C from actual water temperatures. Within specimens, T delta O-18(OSL) and T delta O-18(CT) were offset by ca. 2 degrees C. Some T delta O-18(CT) also exhibited unexplained inter-annual trends, so that T delta O-18(CT) among specimens varied by up to 4 degrees C. Given the delta O-18(shell) inconsistency between and among shells, a small seasonal temperature amplitude barely exceeding 4 degrees C and the error bars of T-delta 18O of geoducks at this setting on the order of +/-2 degrees C (error bars of the paleothermometry equation + variable delta O-18(water) values + precision error of the mass spectrometer), the geochemical record of a single P. abrupta may not serve as a suitable paleoclimate archive. A reliable approximation to paleotemperatures may only be achieved by exclusively sampling the outer shell layer of multiple contemporaneous specimens, so that the T delta O-18(OSL) variance among shells can be quantified.

These events are mainly caused by seawater warming, but are exacerbated by the subsequent decrease in nutrient availability in surface waters. It has therefore been shown that nitrogen, phosphorus or iron limitation contribute to the underlying conditions by which thermal stress induces coral bleaching. Generally, information on the trophic ecology of trace elements (micronutrients) in corals, and on how they modulate the coral response to thermal stress is lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that heterotrophic feeding (i.e. the capture of zooplankton prey by the coral host) and thermal stress induce significant changes in micro element concentrations and isotopic signatures of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. The results obtained first reveal that coral symbionts are the major sink for the heterotrophically acquired micronutrients and accumulate manganese, magnesium and iron from the food. These metals are involved in photosynthesis and antioxidant protection. In addition, we show that fed corals can maintain high micronutrient concentrations in the host tissue during thermal stress and do not bleach, whereas unfed corals experience a significant decrease in copper, zinc, boron, calcium and magnesium in the host tissue and bleach. In addition, the significant increase in Cu-65 and Zn-66 signature of symbionts and host tissue at high temperature suggests that these isotopic compositions are good proxy for stress in corals. Overall, present findings highlight a new way in which coral heterotrophy and micronutrient availability contribute to coral resistance to global warming and bleaching.									14	1	0	0	13	0	15			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000437281500033	29569807

Although spawning stock biomass is high, recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) Summer Flounder remains variable. Chesapeake Bay is one of the principal nursery areas for this species, but processes such as growth and survival that affect production of YOY Summer Flounder in this estuary have not been explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between abundance and size of Summer Flounder recruits from the 1988 to 2012 year classes in Chesapeake Bay. We also considered the effects of environmental factors on fish size because conditions in the bay vary spatially during the time that fish occupy nursery areas. To describe variations in Summer Flounder size, we used monthly length observations from 13,018 YOY fish captured by bottom trawl from the lower Chesapeake Bay and the James, York, and Rappahannock river subestuaries where Summer Flounder are commonly observed. We applied a generalized additive model to describe spatial, temporal, and environmental effects on observed fish size; we also considered the density of Summer Flounder and an index of productivity as factors in the model. Summer Flounder in Chesapeake Bay exhibited density-dependent and spatially related variations in mean length: larger fish were found mostly in the Bay and smaller fish in the subestuaries. Additionally, low (< 13 degrees C) and high (>26 degrees C) temperatures and low salinities (<10 psu) had a negative effect on fish size, indicating that individuals found in these environments were typically smaller than conspecifics inhabiting areas of moderate temperatures and higher salinities. Variable nursery habitat conditions in temperate estuaries affect fish size and, subsequently, may influence production of Summer Flounder year classes through effects on maturation and survival. As water temperatures in the mid-Atlantic region continue to increase, YOY Summer Flounder size may be negatively affected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

All the physical and biological observations were integrated in coupled circulation-trophodynamic simulations. The three-dimensional circulation fields were modeled using data assimilation methods described in Aretxabaleta et al. [2005. Data assimilative hindcast on the Southern Flank of Georges Bank during May 1999: frontal circulation and implications. Continental Shelf Research 25, 849-874]. The individual-based model (IBM) of Lough et al. [2005. A general biophysical model of larval cod growth applied to populations on Georges Bank. Fisheries Oceanography 14, 241-262] was used to consider trophodynamic effects on the growth and survival of larval cod. Prey fields were specified for mixed and stratified water columns from field surveys and allowed to adjust in the circulation model. Encounter and ingestion rates of larvae were functions of prey concentration, larval search patterns, light, swimming speeds of predator and prey, and turbulence. Model outputs provide hourly depth-dependent estimates of growth rates, prey biomass ingested, and larval length and weight. Simulations were conducted along a 2-D transect across the tidal front, from mixed to stratified water columns, before and after a wind event. Pre-storm, observed larval cod growth rates, based on RNA-DNA analysis, were highest in the surface 20 m at the stratified and front stations. Poststorm, larval growth rates decreased 1-2% d(-1) at the stratified and front stations, corresponding with a < 1 degrees C decrease in temperature. At the mixed station, there was no apparent difference in growth rates with depth, either before or after the storm. Simulations indicate that maximum larval growth rates can occur at the tidal-mixing front due to the accumulation of prey in a region of near optimal temperature, turbulence, and light. However, away from the front, high abundance of prey can compensate for environmental conditions (e.g., light and turbulence levels) that are less than optimal.

They are particularly useful for identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the data, and for exploring plausible scenarios of change. We compiled data on the pelagic foodweb of the South Georgia shelf, which is one of the most intensively studied areas in the Southern Ocean. The data suggest that current average annual copepod production is three times that of Antarctic krill and that flying seabirds and fish are, respectively, responsible for 25% and 21% of local krill consumption. The most striking inconsistency was that estimated consumption of fish was 5 times their estimated production. We developed a static mass balance model of the foodweb representing one of many possible solutions to the inconsistencies in the data. The model included sufficient fish biomass to balance the original consumption estimate, and consequently fish became the main krill consumers. Nonetheless, only 74% of local krill production was consumed by predators, suggesting that there are additional mortality sources that we did not explicitly model. We developed further models to explore scenarios incorporating plausible climate-driven reductions in krill biomass. In scenarios with unchanged predator diets, an 80% reduction in krill biomass resulted in a 73% reduction in vertebrate biomass. However, when predators with diverse diets were able to switch to feeding on alternative zooplankton prey, total vertebrate biomass was maintained at current levels. Scenarios in which 80% of krill biomass was replaced with copepod biomass required 28% more primary production because the estimated consumption rate of copepods is higher than that of krill. The additional copepod biomass did not alter the consequences for vertebrates. These scenarios illustrate the wide range of potential consequences of a shift from a krill to a copepod dominated system in a warming climate. They suggest that both maintenance and dramatic reduction of vertebrate production are plausible outcomes, although the former requires major changes in predator diets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured eggspace' temperatures adjacent to natural egg clutches in populations distributed across a range of latitudes (36 degrees 8-44 degrees 6) and altitudes (213-3171 m). Eggs laid > 50 cm above the ground averaged 3.1 degrees C cooler than ambient air at 1 m height, while eggs at < 1 cm height averaged 15.5 degrees C hotter than ambient, ranging up to 47 degrees C. Because of differences in egg height, eggs at 3171 m elevation and 20.6 degrees C ambient air experienced mean eggspace temperatures 7 degrees C hotter than those at 213 m elevation and ambient 33.3 degrees C. Experimental eggs survived for one hour at 45 degrees C but were killed by 48 degrees C. Eggs laid low, by positively geotactic butterflies, risked thermal stress. However, at populations where eggs were laid lowest, higher oviposition would have incurred incidental predation from grazers. Interpopulation variation in phenology influenced thermal environment and buffered exposure to thermal stress. At sites with hotter July temperatures, the single annual flight/oviposition period was advanced such that eggs were laid on earlier dates, with cooler ambient temperatures. The insects possessed two mechanisms for advancing egg phenology; they could advance timing of larval diapause-breaking and/or shorten the life cycle by becoming smaller adults. Mean weight of newly-eclosed females varied among populations from 92 to 285 mg, suggesting that variable adult size did influence phenology. Possible options for in situ mitigation of thermal stress include further advancing phenology and raising egg height. We argue that these options exist, as evidenced by current variation in these traits and by failure of E. editha to conform to restrictive biogeographic constraints, such as the expectation that populations at equatorial and poleward range limits be confined to higher and lower elevations, respectively. This optimistic example shows how complex local adaptation can generate resilience to climate warming.									25	0	0	0	21	0	25			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000347052300006

Lacertid lizards are insectivorous ectotherms whose energy requirements and food consumption rates are relatively much lower. Maximizing the net rate of energy intake (profitability) may, therefore, be just an optional strategy for these small ectotherms. Nevertheless, lacertids exhibit precisely defined patterns of prey selection. They are selective in the sizes of the prey they capture, and mean prey size (but not profitability, counterbalanced by the longer times required for handling the larger prey) is a good predictor of prey selection in most of the species examined. The foraging choices of lacertid lizards represent complex behavioural responses, in which at least the following factors may be involved: (1) time constraints, related to reproductive cycles, that seem to favour time minimization in the breeding season; (2) movement minimization in the postbreeding season; (3) nutrient optimization; (4) predation risk that may force lizards to balance between the conflicting demands of feeding and avoiding danger; and (5) body temperature, whose effects on lizard performance may cause temperature dependent shifts in prey choice and feeding behaviour.									20	1	0	0	17	0	21			0268-0130			WOS:A1995RK05200002

The size range of individuals at this site was 1.5-5 cm total length. Additional observations at other sites showed that 0-year silver hake only occurred on silt-sand bottom with amphipod tubes at bottom water temperatures of 8.7-11.4 degrees C. This distribution pattern could be the result of either selective settlement into appropriate habitats or differential predation with higher survivorship in more complex habitats. We posit that 0-year silver hake occur in patches of dense amphipod tube cover to avoid visual predators and co-occur with preferred prey (i.e., amphipods and shrimps).									57	1	0	0	44	0	57			0378-1909			WOS:A1997XW48900008

As such, some water conditions such as temperature fluctuate on a daily and seasonal basis. The aim of this study was to examine the effect on growth, condition, survival of, and Artemia ingestion by, early juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus abdominalis, cultured for 6 wk at temperatures within the species' natural range (8-24 C) and above it (26 C). Seahorses cultured at 20 C were longer and heavier than those at 17 C, although not significantly different to 23 C. There were no differences in survival or Artemia ingestion of juveniles cultured at 17, 20, and 23 C. At 26 C, 100% mortality was reached on Day 15. This study demonstrates that H. abdominalis can be reared in captivity at a range of 17-23 C in early life stages without compromising growth and survival.									9	0	0	0	9	2	9			0893-8849	1749-7345		WOS:000297937000011

Recognizing the complex nature of the fisheries collapses is essential for understanding the impact of human activities on natural systems. The rapid and abrupt shifts in abundance exhibited by some marine fish populations can be driven by the fishing fleet behaving like generalist predators. Here, we propose that fishing fleet has a s-shaped functional predator function that, combined with economic factors and ENSO variability could cause rapid and abrupt transitions in the of jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) fishery in the south-eastern Pacific. Our results showed that fishing fleet predator functional response is well described by a s-shaped function, where ENSO variability (El Nino/La Nina years) appears to decrease/increase the fishing rate. Our model predictions were able to accurately forecast independent data of jackmackerel acoustic survey estimates. We show that the population trend and collapse of jack mackerel stock at the Humboldt Current Ecosystem (HCE) can be explained by the changes in fishing effort, which seem to be driven by economic forces and El Nino climatic variability. Our simple model allows us to explore some management responses in a heuristic manner. The most critical element seems to be the combination of an n-shaped isocline for fish stock growth, modulated by ENSO variability, and a horizontal isocline of fishing effort which is highly sensitive to changes in the profitability of the fishery. Therefore, the implementation of management policies based on simple theoretical models will be increasingly required to harvest fish stocks in these times of growing demographic demands and climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2296-7745		WOS:000521219100001

Most documented cases of species shifts so far involve relatively small species at lower trophic levels, and consider individual species in ecological isolation from others. Here, we show that a large highly migratory top predator fish species has entered a high latitude subpolar area beyond its usual range. Bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus Linnaeus 1758, were captured in waters east of Greenland (65 degrees N) in August 2012 during exploratory fishing for Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus Linnaeus 1758. The bluefin tuna were captured in a single net-haul in 9-11 degrees C water together with 6 tonnes of mackerel, which is a preferred prey species and itself a new immigrant to the area. Regional temperatures in August 2012 were historically high and contributed to a warming trend since 1985, when temperatures began to rise. The presence of bluefin tuna in this region is likely due to a combination of warm temperatures that are physiologically more tolerable and immigration of an important prey species to the region. We conclude that a cascade of climate change impacts is restructuring the food web in east Greenland waters.									48	1	0	0	40	0	50			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000339100200012	24824677

The results indicated that this tropical estuary, which is a Costa Rican fishery hot spot, was already overexploited by shrimp trawlers and the longline fleet, and recent observations suggest further deteriorations in this system. To evaluate the ecosystem and socioeconomic changes in the Gulf of Nicoya over the last 20years, the 1993 model was reconstructed with data from 2013 to compare both system states. Although the summary statistics of both states (i.e., 1993 and 2013) suggested that the system maintained its general functionality and even enabled the total harvest to increase by approximately 20%, a more detailed analysis of the levels of the functional groups suggested that the system was further degraded as follows: (1) most shrimp, eel, and catfish species decreased their share in the catches, with severe economic losses for the fishery; (2) of the species that substantially increased their share in the catches, most were short-lived, low-value species, such as small pelagic and small demersal fishes; and (3) catches of long-lived, high-trophic-level fish, such as rays, sharks, mackerels, and barracudas, decreased. A picture emerged in which the advancing fishery of low-trophic-level species with low economic value enabled the total harvest to increase, while valuable shrimp resources and higher-trophic-level species were depleted. These developments caused a tremendous economic loss of approximately 50%.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1942-5120			WOS:000471322100002		
J	Schell, DM								Declining carrying capacity in the Bering Sea: Isotopic evidence from whale baleen								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				45	2			459	462		10.4319/lo.2000.45.2.0459				MAR 2000	2000	The Bering Sea is a rich marine ecosystem with 1995 U.S. landings of finfish and shellfish in excess of 2 X 10(6) tons. Recently, major declines of marine mammal and bird populations have occurred, with the question arising as to whether the causes were top down, i.e., from fishing pressure, or bottom-up, i.e., driven by climate-change effects. We assessed the latter scenario by using the inverse relationship between phytoplankton cell-growth rates and carbon isotope fractionation to compare seasonal rates of primary productivity. The isotope ratios in the long baleen plates from bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) laid down while the whales fed in the Bering and Chukchi seas were used as a proxy for the average annual isotope ratios in their zooplankton prey and, by extension, phytoplankton. Plates from 37 whales produced a continuous isotopic record from 1947-1997 and indicate that seasonal productivity was higher in 1947-1976, peaking in 1966. Since that time, average delta(13)C values have declined by over 2.7 parts per thousand until 1997, inferring a drop in seasonal carbon fixation of similar to 30-40%. Alternatively, lowered isotope ratios could arise if phytoplankton stocks significantly increased over time while cell-growth rates declined. However, long-term literature estimates for phytoplankton in the Western and Eastern Pacific Ocean and Eastern Bering Sea show either no trend or a decrease over time. Archaeological samples of baleen from ca. 100 and 2,200 yr. B.P. showed average delta(13)C values higher than any in the last five decades, implying still higher productivity in the past. The lowered carrying capacity is a likely contributor to the decline of top consumers in the region.									110	0	0	0	81	0	110			0024-3590			WOS:000085822300020

We argue here that dispersal kernels are in fact highly dynamic during periods of range advance because density effects and spatial assortment by dispersal ability ("spatial selection") drive the evolution of increased dispersal on the expanding front. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we demonstrate this effect under a wide variety of population growth rates and dispersal costs. We then test the possibility of an evolved shift in dispersal kernels by measuring dispersal rates in individual cane toads (Bufo marinus) from invasive populations in Australia (historically, toads advanced their range at 10 km/year, but now they achieve 155 km/year in the northern part of their range). Under a common-garden design, we found a steady increase in dispersal tendency with distance from the invasion origin. Dispersal kernels on the invading front were less kurtotic and less skewed than those from origin populations. Thus, toads have increased their rate of range expansion partly through increased dispersal on the expanding front. For accurate long-range forecasts of range advance, we need to take into account the potential for dispersal kernels to be evolutionarily dynamic.

J	Lehman, Brendan; Huff, David D.; Hayes, Sean A.; Lindley, Steven T.								Relationships between Chinook Salmon Swimming Performance and Water Quality in the San Joaquin River, California								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				146	2			349	358		10.1080/00028487.2016.1271827				MAR 2017	2017	There is currently only a limited understanding of the relationship between water quality and predation on Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. smolts. We addressed the hypothesis that poor water quality will decrease a smolt's swimming performance and presumably its predator evasion capabilities. Predation is a major factor affecting salmon smolt survival throughout the San Joaquin River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Prior studies have quantified predation rates, but the effect of water quality on predator evasion capability has not previously been evaluated. We quantified the swimming performance of juvenile Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha in relation to water quality variables. The maximum swim speeds (U-max) of 45 hatchery-reared smolts (7.1-9.9 cm FL) were measured in controlled (laboratory) and field environments by using a mobile swim tunnel respirometer; measurements were obtained before and after the fish received a 2-d exposure to the lower San Joaquin River while being held in flow-through cages. To sample across a diversity of environmental conditions, we conducted trials during a 6-week period that coincided with the peak smolt out-migration. Regression models were constructed to evaluate relationships between swimming performance and four water quality covariates (water temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity). We found negative relationships between Umax and both temperature and turbidity, and we described these relationships graphically. Our findings suggest that water quality management strategies with the potential to improve salmon smolt survival include managing temperatures and suspended sediment concentrations to optimize the swimming capacity of migrating smolts and possibly improve their ability to evade predators.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000489650300008

Hence, these factors can influence size-dependent species interactions, such as predation. In the Wadden Sea, predation by crustaceans plays an important role in the survival of pre-recruit bivalves. To investigate growth rates and size-dependent loss in 2 distant regions of the Wadden Sea, in situ marking with the fluorochrome calcein was combined with cage experiments. Through marking, we obtained, for the first time, size-increment data for the fragile newly settled juveniles of the species Macoma balthica and Cerastoderma edule in the field. Growth and size-selective mortality were analysed separately, whereas hitherto both have usually been inferred from size distributions at this life stage. Fluorescent marking also revealed that growth rates were very variable among individuals. Growth was temporarily higher at Texel than at Sylt in both species. In combination with the exclosure experiments and the sampling of predators and migrating bivalves, selective loss of smaller individuals was detected in both regions and was related to predation pressure. Climate influences on phenology have potentially strong effects on species interactions, altering survival and thus recruitment and population dynamics.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0171-8630			WOS:000313344300011		
J	Zhao, Jiyan; Yang, Yangheshan; Xi, Xinqiang; Zhang, Changbing; Sun, Shucun								Artificial Warming Facilitates Growth but Not Survival of Plateau Frog (Rana kukunoris) Tadpoles in Presence of Gape-Limited Predatory Beetles								PLOS ONE				9	6					e98252	10.1371/journal.pone.0098252				JUN 6 2014	2014	Background: Global warming has been frequently demonstrated to increase growth rate in larval amphibians that have considerable phenotypic plasticity; this may lead to an increase in larval survival because large larvae are less likely to be captured by gape-limited predators. This study is to test whether warming could improve tadpole growth and thereby enhance the tadpole survival in plateau frog Rana kukunoris.Methodology: We conducted an experiment involving growing tadpoles under two contrasting temperatures, i.e. ambient temperature vs. warming by 3.8 degrees C, with and without their major predators - the gape-limited predaceous diving beetles Agabus sp. in eastern Tibetan Plateau, in a factorial arrangement. We recorded the survival and measured body fresh weight and morphological characteristics of the tadpoles.Principal Findings: Warming significantly increased body fresh weight in the presence of predators after three weeks of treatments. However, the predators imposed significant and similar effects on the survival of tadpoles under both ambient and elevated temperatures, with the effects mostly occurring in the first three weeks of the experiment. Changes in the body form, i.e. the greater whole length at a given fresh weight and the longer tail at a given body length, could have acted as mechanisms of defense and escape for the tadpoles.Conclusions/Significance: Warming did not increase tadpole survival with or without presence of predators. Moreover, an increased growth rate (due to warming in the presence of predators) was not a major factor contributing to the tadpole survival. We postulate that even if warming increases the tadpole growth rate in the plateau frog, it does not necessarily improve their survival in the presence of gape-limited predators.									7	2	0	0	8	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000341869000025	24905846

But, historical information on hilsa biology and ecology has confronted the scientists and policymakers with research and management challenges. We have reviewed both the old and recent findings on hilsa fishery to document the status of knowledge and potential gaps, necessary to comprehend for formulating a more effective fishery management plan. Thus, there has been a decline in hilsa catches in the riverine system associated with shift in fish migration routes, indiscriminate harvesting of brood and juvenile fish, and degradation of habitat. Specifically, the riverine hilsa catches peaked in the 1960s, declining thereafter, and became relatively abundant in marine waters since 1990s. Biological data indicated that hilsa goes through multiple reproductive cycles; therefore, a comprehensive understanding of reproductive biology, recruitment by various cohorts, stock abundance and habitats across the life cycle are necessary to accurately impose fishery regulatory measures, such as fishing ban in spawning season in Bangladesh. Moreover, domestication initiative is important for artificial seed production and mariculture development of hilsa that can not only offer economic return to small-scale farmers but also reduce the growing pressure on capture fishery. Importantly, the arrangement of co-management is found ideal as fishermen, scientists and managers can work jointly to improve the regulatory processes and to sustain the hilsa fishery over time.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			1467-2960	1467-2979		WOS:000454197900004

During May to August 2007, we investigated 147 clusters of locations (31% of the total) and found evidence of predation on a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawn and yearling, a beaver (Castor canadensis), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), and fisher (Martes pennanti) and scavenging on a road-killed deer and other carrion. However, we missed finding many prey items and discuss the problems associated with trying to conduct such a study.									20	0	0	0	21	0	21			1612-4642	1439-0574		WOS:000286630300015

The present study investigated the pre-imaginal development of S. decastigmus at different temperatures. The temperatures were: 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, with a relative humidity of 70 +/- 10% and a photofase of 12 h, and the nymphs were fed larvae of M. ochroloma. We evaluated the duration and viability of the egg and nymphal stages, the duration of each instar, and the predation potential. The incubation time decreased with increasing temperature, and the viability was highest at 25 degrees C. The duration of the nymphal stage was inversely proportional to the temperature, ranging from 18 days at 30 degrees C to 40.6 days at 20 degrees C. The highest S. decastigmus predation rates were found at 20 degrees C (90.4 larvae) and 30 degrees C (72.5 larvae). S. decastigmus showed the highest viability and lowest consumption of larvae of M. ochroloma at 25 degrees C.									4	0	0	0	4	1	4			1519-6984	1678-4375		WOS:000376681300026	26983086

The Wyoming toad (Anaxyrus baxteri) is a critically endangered amphibian whose cause of decline and inability to reestablish breeding populations despite early life stage reintroductions remains unknown; habitat degradation and the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are 2 potential contributing factors. In 2013, we experimentally tested the effects of habitat factors under food supplemented and predator-protected conditions (i.e., mesh field enclosures) on time to metamorphosis, the proportion of tadpoles that metamorphosed, tadpole and toadlet size, the proportion of toadlets remaining in enclosures at release (approx. 1 month post-metamorphosis), and Bd prevalence in early life stages of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge. In 2014, we tested the effects of small-scale application of vegetation height management on toadlet size, the proportion of toadlets that remained, and Bd prevalence until 1 month post-metamorphosis. In 2013, median time to metamorphosis (25.5 days) was shorter in warmer water temperatures and proportion of tadpoles that metamorphosed was 0.70. In 2013, toadlet size was positively related to forb cover up to 35% and although overall treatment effect was not significant, mid-vegetation height treatments (10-30 cm) had fewer small toadlets at release than short (010 cm) and tall (>30 cm) vegetation heights. In 2014, vegetation height treatment (11.49-31.6 cm) had marginal support for estimating larger size at release. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was not detected in water samples or on post-metamorphic toadlets. Our results suggest that in mesh field enclosures, time to metamorphosis is shorter in warm water. In addition, vegetation heights of 10-30 cm and up to 35% forb cover within terrestrial mesh enclosures could increase Wyoming toad post-metamorphic size, which could increase overwinter survival rates. Using mesh field enclosures for soft-release may improve the effectiveness of early life stage reintroduction efforts, but predator attraction and density-dependent growth need to be considered. Habitat management can also influence growth and survival of early life stages of amphibians and may benefit reintroduction efforts for other species.

An inverse relationship existed between clearance rate and algal cell concentration. Mean clearance rate ranged from 0.0034 to 0.0385 mL h(-1) for larvae and 0.14 to 0.41 mL h(-1) for juveniles of 0.5 mm shell height and increased to 248-420 mL h(-1) for juveniles of 10 mm shell height. Clearance rate increased with shell size allometrically, with a mean exponent of 2.460 +/- 0.087. Weight-specific clearance rate was independent of shell size at >20 cells mu L-1, but slightly decreased with increasing shell size at lower cell concentrations. Larvae and juveniles showed higher ingestion rates at higher algal concentrations, and the hyperbolic relationship was described using an enzymatic kinetic equation. Maximum ingestion rate occurred at approximately 20 cells mu L-1 in larvae and at >20 cells mu L-1 in juveniles. As temperature increased from 10 to 30 degrees C, larvae and juveniles became more active in feeding. Relative rates of clearance and ingestion at 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C were 8.4, 22.0, 52.8, and 88.2%, respectively, of the mean rate at 30 degrees C.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0730-8000			WOS:A1997XM07200006

We studied the relationships between spiders, the epiphytic tank bromeliad, Aechmea bracteata, and its associated ants in an inundated forest in Quintana Roo, Mexico, during a drought period while, exceptionally, this forest was dry and then during the flooding that followed. We compared spider abundance and diversity between 'Aechmea-areas' and 'control-areas' of the same surface area. We recorded six spider families: the Dipluridae, Ctenidae, Salticidae, Araneidae, Tetragnathidae and Linyphiidae among which the funnel-web tarantula, Ischnothele caudata, the only Dipluridae noted, was the most abundant. During the drought period, the spiders were more numerous in the Aechmea-areas than in the control-areas, but they were not obligatorily associated with the Aechmea. During the subsequent flooding, the spiders were concentrated in the A. bracteata patches, particularly those sheltering an ant colony. Also, a kind of specificity existed between certain spider taxa and ant species, but varied between the drought period and subsequent flooding. We conclude that climatic events modulate the relationship between A. bracteata patches and their associated fauna. Tank bromeliads, previously considered only for their ecological importance in supplying food and water during drought, may also be considered refuges for spiders during flooding. More generally, tank bromeliads have an important role in preserving non-specialized fauna in inundated forests.									9	0	0	0	9	1	10			1932-6203			WOS:000346611400056	25494055	
J	Bishop, MJ; Peterson, CH					Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500			Direct effects of physical stress can be counteracted by indirect benefits: Oyster growth on a tidal elevation gradient								OECOLOGIA				147	3			426	433		10.1007/s00442-005-0273-3				MAR 2006	2006	The paradigmatic gradient for intertidal marine organisms of increasing physical stress from low to high elevation has long served as the basis for using direct effects of duration of water coverage to predict many biological patterns. Accordingly, changes in potential feeding time may predict the direction and magnitude of differences between elevations in individual growth rates of sessile marine invertebrates. Oysters (triploid Crassostrea ariakensis) experimentally introduced at intertidal (MLW+0.05 m) and subtidal (MLW-0.25 m) elevations in racks provided a test of the ability to use duration of water coverage to predict changes in growth. During early-to-mid winter, a depression of 38-47% in shell growth of intertidal oysters matched the 36% reduction in available feeding time relative to subtidal oysters. In late winter as solar heating of exposed oysters increased, growth differences of 52-55% departed only slightly from the predicted 39%. In spring, however, duration of water coverage failed to predict even the correct direction of growth change with elevation as intertidal oysters grew 34% faster despite 39% less feeding time. Intense seasonal development of shell fouling by other suspension feeders like ascidians, mussels, and barnacles on subtidal (94% incidence) but not on aerially exposed intertidal (21-38% incidence) oysters may explain why duration of water cover failed to predict spring growth differences. Less intense fouling develops on intertidal oysters due to the physiological stress of aerial exposure on settlers, especially during higher temperatures and longer solar exposures of spring. Fouling by suspension feeders is known to reduce growth of the host through localized competition for food and added energetic costs. Thus, in springtime, indirect effects of aerial exposure providing a partial refuge from biological enemies overwhelmed direct effects of reduced duration of water coverage to reverse the expected pattern of slower intertidal growth of a marine invertebrate.									26	0	0	0	23	1	26			0029-8549			WOS:000235706200005	16249896

The effect of temperature on SDA has not been studied in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, Bonnaterre 1788), an active pelagic predator that occupies temperate and subtropical waters. The energetic cost and duration of SDA were calculated by comparing routine and post-prandial oxygen consumption rates. Mean routine metabolic rates in yellowfin tuna increased with temperature, from 136 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 20 degrees C to 211 mg O-2 kg(-1) h at 24 degrees C. The mean duration of SDA decreased from 40.2 h at 20 degrees C to 33.1 h at 24 degrees C, while mean SDA coefficient, the percentage of energy in a meal that is consumed during digestion, increased from 5.9% at 20 degrees C to 12.7% at 24 degrees C. Digestion in yellowfin tuna is faster at a higher temperature but requires additional oxidative energy. Enhanced characterization of the role of temperature in SDA of yellowfin tuna deepens our understanding of tuna physiology and can help improve management of aquaculture and fisheries.

African savannas with extensive versus minimal woody cover often have vastly different animal communities. However, we lack a clear mechanistic understanding of why animal communities are changing with vegetation structure. Our goal for this study was to understand how vegetation structure in an African savanna shaped the perceived predation risk of small mammals, hence affecting their activity. Using a reciprocal measure of standard giving-up-densities, amount of food eaten, we found sharp declines in rodents' perceived predation risk and increased rodent activity underneath shrub cover. This response was consistent across species; however, species showed subtle differences in their responses to grassy vegetation. Our findings suggest that areas of minimal or extensive shrub cover (shrub encroachment) may be homogenizing rodents' perceptions of predation risk and thus shaping their use of space.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000496416000067	31727923

We studied caterpillars of instar 1-3 of the Moorland Clouded Yellow (Colias palaeno, Linnaeus, 1761), that is from hatching from the egg until hibernation. The observation by time-lapse cameras enabled us to gather data on several caterpillars simultaneously over longer time periods. Especially, the combination with dataloggers collecting microclimatic data gives interesting insights in the life, mortality causes and behaviour of the observed caterpillars in relation to microclimatic conditions. To our knowledge, time-lapse or automatic cameras combined with dataloggers collecting microclimatic data have not been used in field studies on phytophagous insects, but only in defined experimental settings or to observe pollinators visiting flowers. Therefore, we summarize our experiences on opportunities and limitations in this communication. If the observed insect is not moving too far and is most of the time visible on the upper surface of the leaf this method can be used for several research questions under very different conditions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1366-638X	1572-9753		WOS:000404178700019

Energy budgets were determined taking into account energy acquisition (ingestion and absorption) and energy expenditure (oxygen consumption, ammonia production, and energy placed into mucus production and egg laying). Relative physiological condition was assessed by calculating the scope for growth index (SFG). Diet and temperature both played key roles in the physiological energetic and reproductive conditioning of this snail. Tagelus was the preferred prey, probably because of its greater vulnerability to predatory attack by C. giganteus. The highest feeding rate was observed at 15degreesC, coinciding with optimal growth. Absorption efficiency was similar with both diets, despite the differential preference in prey. Temperature had no effect on oxygen uptake, but increased as the snails fed on Tagelus during the reproductive conditioning period. Diet was the main factor affecting SFG, and temperature, although significant, accounted for a lower percentage of variation in SFG. Highest growth rates were observed at 15degrees C on a Tagelus diet. Reproductive effort, measured as the proportion of the total energy budget of an organism that is allocated to reproduction, was highest at 18degreesC with a Tagelus diet. Energy would not be allocated for reproduction when the snails were fed with M. chilensis, as SFG was negative at all three temperatures.									13	0	0	0	13	3	13			0028-8330			WOS:000177049300007		
J	Ciannelli, L; Bailey, KM								Landscape dynamics and resulting species interactions: the cod-capelin system in the southeastern Bering Sea								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				291				227	236		10.3354/meps291227				2005	2005	Capelin area major component of cod diet in many ecosystems of the North Atlantic. In the Bering Sea, however, the percentage of capelin found in Pacific cod stomachs is negligible. We hypothesize that the landscape (or 'seascape') features of hydrography and bathymetry of the Bering Sea impose a constraint on the distribution of cod and capelin that contributes to their spatial segregation and ultimately, to their uniquely weak trophic link. We analyzed a long-term data collection (1972 to 2001) on Pacific cod and capelin catches and feeding interactions, and developed a new metric to quantify the spatially explicit overlap between a predator and a prey. Our analysis indicates that cod and capelin distributions respond to the thermal conditions of the Bering Sea. Typically, a frigid water mass is present on the middle portion of the shelf, and cod distribution is confined to the southern side of the cold pool, while capelin is confined to the north. However, in warm years the middle shelf is penetrated by thermal gateways (between 1 and 6 degrees C), allowing cod to invade the capelin habitat. In this situation, when cod and capelin overlap, cod feed heavily on capelin. The annual index of cod and capelin overlap is correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, a climate indicator of the North Pacific. The width of the thermal gateways in the middle shelf is also correlated with the PDO. These results point to a direct causal link, from climate and thermal conditions of the Bering Sea shelf, to cod and capelin distribution, and ultimately to their overlap and trophic interactions.									58	0	0	0	36	0	58			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000229699400020

As these tropical trees expand poleward, they are replacing herbaceous saltmarsh vegetation. Mangroves and saltmarsh vegetation are ecosystem engineers that are typically viewed as having similar ecosystem functions. However, few studies have investigated whether predation regimes, community structure, and ecosystem functions are shifting at the saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone. In this study, we manipulated predator access to marsh and mangrove creekside habitats to test their role in mediating vegetation and invertebrate structure and stability in a two-year experiment. We also conducted a survey to evaluate how shifting vegetation is modifying structural complexity, invertebrate communities, and ecosystem functioning at the ecotone. Excluding larger (> 2 cm diameter) predators did not affect vegetation or invertebrate structure or stability in either saltmarsh or mangrove habitats. The survey revealed that the two habitat types consistently differ in structural metrics, including vegetation height, inter-stem distance, and density, yet they support similar invertebrate and algal communities, soil properties, and predation rates. We conclude that although mangrove range expansion immediately modifies habitat structural properties, it is not altering larger predator consumptive effects, community stability, community composition, or some other ecosystem functions and properties at the ecotone.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				1424-2818		WOS:000500005400003

Pacific saury has been commercially exploited and its stock size shows large fluctuations. It spawns from autumn to spring. Growth and survival in the early life stage have been considered the major factors controlling recruitment fluctuations. The winter spawning cohort showed a fast and stable growth rate during their early stage. Ages of 40 mm juveniles (t(40)) calculated from growth rate estimations were stable during the 30-yr period and showed a significant positive correlation to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index in winter. A negative correlation between the t40 and the catch record of medium size saury ( 24.0 - 28.9 cm) was detected but was not significant. Recruitment of the winter spawning cohort is thought to be regulated not only by the duration of the vulnerable larval period but also by other biological factors, i.e. mortality after the larval stage and the abundance of predators.					2nd GLOBEC Open Science Meeting2nd GLOBEC Open Science Meeting	OCT 15-18, 2002OCT 15-18, 2002	GLOBECGLOBEC	QINGDAO, PEOPLES R CHINAQINGDAO, PEOPLES R CHINA	8	2	0	0	8	0	11			1054-6006			WOS:000185446000019

Water temperature, oxygen and salinity were measured at two different light penetration depths. Inorganic nutrients, total and nannophytoplanktonic chlorophyll a were determined at each depth and additional samples were taken for phytoplankton taxonomic work. Oblique zooplankton hauls were done and abundance, composition and dry weight of zooplankton were determined. Indirect grazing rate estimate was calculated using the pigment budget. The Study period coincided with an El Nino event detected in the Punta Morales zone and reflected by a change in the physico-chemical water characteristics. Some nutrient concentrations were correlated to the salinity, and significant differences were observed between the transition and rainy seasons in the phytoplankton biomass of the two fractions. A total of 43 phytoplankton taxa were identified and flagellates, centric and pennate diatoms represented 90% of the total phytoplankton abundance. In the zooplanktonic samples, copepods were the most abundant group and Acartia lilljeborgii, Pseudodiaptomus sp. and Paracalanus parvus were the dominant herbivores; dry weight mean values of herbivorous copepods were between 0.6 and 50 mg m(-3). Grazing rate showed a mean of 0.67 +/- 0.83 d(-1). This study showed a seasonal behavior with changes in nutrient concentrations, availability of phytoplankton and rising temperatures through El Nino. Predation and grazing pressure produced changes in the structure of plankton (phyto and zooplankton) Populations in the internal zone of Gulf of Nicoya.									16	0	0	0	14	3	16			0717-3326	0718-1957		WOS:000258785600008

The model included (i) multiple age classes of pollock, (ii) a generic predator, (iii) fisheries, and (iv) major prey of pollock. Major processes considered were (i) recruitment, (ii) bottom-up control of somatic growth, (iii) mortality because of predation, cannibalism and fishing, GO size-selective prey selection, (v) temperature-dependent bioenergetics such as conversion efficiency and daily consumption rate, and (vi) production and advective supply of prey. By assuming that pollock select prey based upon both relative abundance and predator-prey size relationships, the model accurately simulated seasonal and ontogenetic variations in the diet. However considering ontogenetic segregation, the model showed that, due to cannibalism, newly recruited fish would be totally consumed within 6 months after settlement. By considering segregation (10% overlap during spring and 0.1% during other seasons), an agreement of diet between the simulation and empirical data averaged 82.7% for the different seasons and fish sizes. Euphausiids, the most important prey of pollock, suffered the highest predation impact (22.2 +/- 5.3 WWg m(-2) yr(-1)) exceeding annual production in the model domain (17.2 +/- 0.1 WWg m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that an advective supply of prey is necessary to support the pollock population. The daily ration of pollock during spring and summer averaged at 1.2 and 0.6% BW day(-1) for small (less than or equal to200 mm) and large (>200 mm) pollock, respectively; this daily ration was reduced by half during autumn and winter.									23	0	0	0	18	0	24			1054-6006	1365-2419		WOS:000226723100013

Due to its small size, P. similis has potential for rearing marine fish larvae which require first food smaller than B. rotundiformis We examined the. feasibility of using P. similis as live food by analyzing its life history, population growth and feeding incidence by fish larvae. P similis produced first offspring on 2.5-2.8 days after hatch. Females produced 4.3-7.8 offspring during their 2.9-3.4 day reproductive period. P. similis grew well at temperatures 25 to 35 degrees C (density=250 to 1030 ind./ml; r=0.68 to 0.81 day(-1)) and at salinities 2 to 15 ppt (density 360 to 500 ind./ml; r=0.73 to 0.78 day(-1)). Population density of P. similis was higher than B. rotundiformis after 8 days of culture period with either N. oculata and C. vulgaris as food. In mass culture, population density of P. similis increased from 25 to 2400 ind./ml (r = 0.42 day(-1)) after 11 days. Results from feeding experiments confirm that P. similis is consumed by seven-band grouper (Epinephelus septemfasciatus) larvae. The larvae demonstrated the highest feeding rate at 20 ind./ml of R similis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									28	0	0	0	26	1	29			0044-8486	1873-5622		WOS:000267565700010

To study this, the water level in experimental tanks was reduced shortly before time of metamorphosis. Water level remained high in control tanks. The experiment was performed at two different tadpole densities and replicated four times, with tadpoles from different source ponds. The experimental treatment, simulating a drying pond, resulted in earlier metamorphosis while no significant difference in size at metamorphosis was found. Resources per capita decreased as a result of the decreased water level so the increase in development rate was not an effect of feeding conditions. Temperatures in the tanks were such that it is unlikely that the increased development rate was due to temperature effects. I interpret the advancement of metamorphosis as an adaptive response to the threat of drying. This response has been documented for several other anuran species. All those breed in temporary water bodies, supporting the hypothesis that the trait is an evolved adaptation for breeding in such waters.									51	2	3	0	54	0	60			0173-5373			WOS:000084551500006

As such, it is an important determinant of the potential invasive ability of organisms and may limit population expansion unless organisms can physiologically respond to changes in temperature either through plasticity or by adapting to their novel environment. Here, we studied the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, which has become invasive on a global scale. We compared adults from an invasive population of western France with individuals from two populations in the native range in South Africa. We measured the thermal dependence of locomotor performance in adults given its relevance to dispersal, predator escape, and prey capture. Our results show significant differences in the limits of the 80% performance breadth interval for endurance with the French population showing a left shift in its limits congruent with the colder climate experienced in France. The French invasive population was introduced only about 40years ago suggesting a rapid shift in the thermal physiology. Given that all individuals were acclimated under laboratory conditions at 23 degrees C for 2 months this suggests that the invasive frogs have adapted to their new environment. These data may allow the refinement of physiologically informed species distribution models permitting better estimates of future ranges at risk of invasion.

We conducted field caging experiments and collected weekly nekton samples in shallow open-water habitat in a marsh pond during summer and fall 2007 in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA, to estimate growth and morality rates of juvenile white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus. Growth rates (mean +/- 1 SE) were lower during the summer experiment (0.77 +/- 0.05 mm d(-1)) than the fall (0.91 +/- 0.04 mm d(-1)), and high summer water temperatures may have inhibited shrimp growth. Cohort analysis to derive mortality estimates from 15 weekly sampling trips failed due to extended periods of continuous recruitment, the lack of clearly identifiable cohorts, and high temporal variability in abundance estimates. Catch-curve analysis provided estimates of mean daily instantaneous mortality (Z) during the sampling period of 0.181 for post-larvae and early juveniles <28 mm TL and 0.083 for larger juveniles >28 mm. The mortality estimates must be interpreted with caution due to potential problems meeting the assumptions of catch-curve analysis. Despite the challenges, comparisons of vital rates among habitats are required to validate long-held paradigms on the functioning of estuarine nurseries and the importance of various coastal habitats in the support of fishery species.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000281566900007

The optimal temperature range for polyp production is 19-25 degrees C, while medusa production and growth require warmer water (21-30 degrees C). Reasons for the sporadic occurrence of medusae in nature are still unclear. Culturing medusae has been problematic while culturing polyps in the laboratory is well documented. The successful culturing of C. sowerbii medusae to gonad development is only documented to our knowledge in articles in Japanese with a probable limited readership. We successfully cultured all life cycle stages of Craspedacusta, including medusae. Medusae budded from polyps from Gatun, Panama and were cultured at 23 and 26 degrees C using local water and Hydra Medium. Medusae bell morphology, tentacle number, gonad development, and the number and size of prey consumed were documented. Smaller medusae were hand-fed, while mature medusae captured prey. Medusae lived for 3-11weeks and gonad development occurred. A more thorough understanding of temperature, water chemistry, and laboratory feeding protocols during all life cycle stages of C. sowerbii will aid in predicting future distribution patterns of this invasive hydroid in freshwater habitats.									5	0	0	0	3	0	6			0792-4259	2157-0272		WOS:000372063300003

We present data collated over an 8-year period from a catchment of geothermally heated streams in Iceland, which acts as a natural experiment on the effects of warming across different organisational levels and spatiotemporal scales. Body sizes and population biomasses of individual species responded strongly to temperature, with some providing evidence to support temperature size rules. Macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal community composition also changed dramatically across the thermal gradient. Interactions within the warm streams in particular were characterised by food chains linking algae to snails to the apex predator, brown trout These chains were missing from the colder systems, where snails were replaced by much smaller herbivores and invertebrate omnivores were the top predators. Trout were also subsidised by terrestrial invertebrate prey, which could have an effect analogous to apparent competition within the aquatic prey assemblage. Top-down effects by snails on diatoms were stronger in the warmer streams, which could account for a shallowing of mass-abundance slopes across the community. This may indicate reduced energy transfer efficiency from resources to consumers in the warmer systems and/or a change in predator-prey mass ratios. All the ecosystem process rates investigated increased with temperature, but with differing thermal sensitivities, with important implications for overall ecosystem functioning (e.g. creating potential imbalances in elemental fluxes). Ecosystem respiration rose rapidly with temperature, leading to increased heterotrophy. There were also indications that food web stability may be lower in the warmer streams.									85	3	0	0	74	0	88			0065-2504		978-0-12-398315-2	WOS:000317240700003

The growth rate of larvae was modelled as a function of age, temperature, and prey concentration and the mortality rate as a function of age and temperature. Numerical results indicate that upwelling events during the spawning season may have a negative impact on larval survival. Total larval biomass seems to be mainly controlled by larval prey relative to temperature. This preliminary study does not account for the dynamics of the food chain and therefore the intense biological activity associated with an upwelling event, as well as the influence of river plumes in retention mechanisms.

PREY-MEDIATED EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON CONDITION AND SURVIVAL OF A TERRESTRIAL SNAKE								ECOLOGY				89	10			2770	2776		10.1890/07-2017.1				OCT 2008	2008	Drought can have severe ecological effects and global climate-change theory predicts that droughts are likely to increase in frequency and severity. Therefore, it is important that we broaden our understanding of how drought affects not only individual species, but also multitrophic interactions. Here we document vegetation and small-mammal abundance and associated patterns of Texas ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta) body condition and survival before, during, and after a drought in central Texas, USA. Vegetation (grass and forbs) height and small-mammal capture rates were two times greater in wet years compared to the drought year. The decline of small mammals (the snakes' principal prey) during the drought was associated with a drop in ratsnake body condition, consistent with reduced food intake. During the drought, snake mortality also increased 24%. Although higher snake mortality was attributable to predation and road mortality rather than being a direct result of starvation, an increase in risk-prone behavior by foraging snakes probably increased their exposure to those other mortality factors. Drought conditions lasted only for 21 months, and vegetation, small- mammal abundance, and snake condition had returned to pre-drought levels within a year. Although estimates of snake population size were not available, it is likely that substantially more than a year was required for the population to return to its previous size.									33	0	0	0	33	0	34			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000259995100011	18959314

Nestling growth rates are highly susceptible to variation in environmental conditions and parental investment, and highly variable environments with short breeding seasons such as the Arctic magnify these tradeoffs. Arctic-nesting passerines provide a good model system in which to explore variation within and between species in growth rates with regard to environmental conditions and the timing of clutch initiation. Here we investigated interannual and interspecies variation in nestling mass gain for 2 species of Arctic-breeding passerine, Gambel's White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) and Lapland Longspur (Calcarius lapponicus), across 2 years. The nestling period of 2014 was both colder (with lower minimum and maximum temperatures) and wetter (with 73% more rainfall) than 2013. Arthropod biomass was also reduced in shrub tundra in 2014 compared to 2013. Both species showed reductions in rate of daily mass gain of nestlings in 2014 compared to 2013, but we observed no significant difference between species. Furthermore, we found that in 2014 early nesting birds had higher rates of nestling growth than those initiating clutches later in the season. These findings suggest that overall environmental conditions were more challenging for raising nestlings in 2014 compared to 2013 and that these differences were manifested in a reduced rate of nestling mass gain in both species. Furthermore, both species showed a negative correlation between precipitation and growth rates, whereas only Lapland Longspur showed a positive correlation between growth rates and temperature.									24	0	0	0	25	0	26			0004-8038	1938-4254		WOS:000376770100014

Though the bloom was not massive in terms of biomass its unialgal nature indicated that it had a strong and unspecific toxin. Microscopy did not reveal any likely predators on C. polylepis. However adding a sample from bloom water in the second stage in a chemostat with C. polylepis in the first stage gave growth of a heliozoan Heterophrys marina which grew well on C. polylepis. Growth studies were performed in cell culture chambers. Maximal growth rates were measured at concentrations of C. polylepis around 2000 cells/ml, growth rates decreased at increasing concentrations and zero growth or negative growth were found at concentrations of P-limited C. polylepis above 75 000 cells/ml H. marina were in this situation without visible axopods and non spherical. Transferring these cells into fresh medium with low numbers of C. polylepis gave normal growth after 2-3 days. The growth rate was fairly temperature dependent. H. marina had variable growth on other phytoflagellates, however it did not grow with a diatom or Alexandrium tamarense as food source.The particulars of the biology of H. marina shows an organism with considerable adaptive flexibility. These adaptations can be seen as changes in cell volume, rapid conversion from/to sedentary/planktonic life style, multiple fission without cell growth and wide range in food preference. It may be particularly suited as predator on C. polylepis as C. polylepis were seemingly attracted to cells of H. marina concentrating in its vicinity.					1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON FREE-LIVING HETEROTROPHIC FLAGELLATES1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON FREE-LIVING HETEROTROPHIC FLAGELLATES	AUG 06-11, 1990AUG 06-11, 1990	BRIT COUNCIL; CARLSBERG FDN; COMMISS EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES; COUNCIL EUROPE; ROYAL SOC LONDON; SYSTEMAT ASSOC; TANSLEY TRUSTBRIT COUNCIL; CARLSBERG FDN; COMMISS EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES; COUNCIL EUROPE; ROYAL SOC LONDON; SYSTEMAT ASSOC; TANSLEY TRUST	HELSINGOR, DENMARKHELSINGOR, DENMARK	20	0	0	0	19	0	20			0078-5326			WOS:A1991FY87000005

These biogenic substances are the dominant volatile organic compounds in air in forested regions. They contribute to the formation of thopospheric ozone and other photochemical oxidants if mixed with polluted air from urban areas. Increased ozone levels hamper photosynthesis and thus have a negative impact on the growth of forests and crops. Terpene flux estimations are needed for models of atmospheric chemistry and for carbon budgets. Several models of natural terpene emission have been constructed, both in a global scale and for various regions. Ideally, a model of natural terpene emissions should show the terpene flux at different times of day and year, at different weather conditions, and for different ecosystems. Its resolution should be sufficient to show short emission peaks. It should also be able to accommodate extreme events like pest outbreaks and serious storms, especially since those are expected to become more common due to global warming. An examination of the scientific literature on monoterpene content in trees and emission fluxes for the dominant boreal forest tree species shows that models aiming to predict terpene fluxes from natural sources over time should include the factors temperature and light intensity, and possibly also take into account the seasonal variation of terpene levels in trees. As wood tissue damage increases emissions, a base level of herbivory and insect predation should be estimated and included. When identification of high concentrations is important, models should have sufficient resolution to capture the emission peaks found, for example, at bud break. The temperature dependence is shown to vary sufficiently between different tree species to motivate using specific values for the ecosystems examined.					16th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution16th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	SEP, 2008SEP, 2008	WIT Transact Ecol & EnvironWIT Transact Ecol & Environ	Wessex Inst Technol, Skiathos, GREECEWessex Inst Technol, Skiathos, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-3541		978-1-84564-127-6	WOS:000265065800012		
J	Marvin, Glenn A.; Davis, Kayla; Dawson, Jacob								Effect of acute low body temperature on predatory behavior and prey-capture efficiency in a plethodontid salamander								PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR				158				121	127		10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.02.038				MAY 1 2016	2016	The low-temperature limit for feeding in some salamander species (Desmognathus, Plethodontidae) has been inferred from field studies of seasonal variation in salamander activity and gut contents, which could not determine whether feeding is more dependent on environmental conditions influencing salamander foraging behavior or prey availability and movement. We performed two controlled laboratory experiments to examine the effect of short-term (acute) low body temperature on predatory behavior and prey-capture efficiency in a semiaquatic plethodontid salamander (Desmognathus conanti). In the first experiment, we quantified variation in the feeding responses of cold salamanders (at 1,3, 5 and 7 degrees C) to a video recording of a walking, warm (15 degrees C) cricket to determine the lower thermal limit for predatory behavior, independent of any temperature effect on movement of prey. Experimental-group salamanders exhibited vigorous feeding responses at 5 and 7 degrees C, large variation in feeding responses both among and within individuals (over time) at 3 degrees C, and little to no feeding response at 1 degrees C. Feeding responses at both 1 and 3 degrees C were significantly less than at each higher temperature, whereas responses of control-group individuals at 15 degrees C did not vary over time. In the second experiment, we quantified feeding by cold salamanders (at 3, 5, 7 and 11 degrees C) on live, warm crickets to examine thermal effects on prey-capture ability. The mean feeding response to live crickets was significantly less at 3 degrees C than at higher temperatures; however, 50% of salamanders captured and ingested prey with high efficiency at this temperature. We conclude that many individuals stalk and capture prey at very low temperatures (down to 3 degrees C). Our results support a growing body of data that indicate many plethodontid salamanders feed at temperatures only a few degrees above freezing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Hjort (1914) famously attributed this "critical period" of low survival to larval inability to obtain sufficient food. We discuss recent experimental and modeling work, suggesting that the viscous hydrodynamic regime have marked effects on the mechanism of suction feeding in larval fish. As larvae grow, the size of the gape and associated volume of the mouth increase. At the same time, larvae swim faster and can generate faster suction flows, thus transiting to a hydrodynamic regime of higher Reynolds numbers. This hydrodynamic regime further leads to changes in the spatio-temporal patterns of flow in front of the mouth, and an increasing ability in larger larvae to exert suction forces on the prey. Simultaneously, the increase in swimming speed and the distance from which the prey is attacked result in higher rates of encountering prey by larger (older) larvae. In contrast, during the first few days after feeding commence the lower rates of encounter and success in feeding translate to low feeding rates. We conclude that young larvae experience "hydrodynamic starvation," in which low Reynolds numbers mechanically limit their feeding performance even under high densities of prey.

The behavioral model consistently predicts that E. mordax grows much more slowly than would be expected with a pure, net-energy intake rate maximization strategy. The reduced growth rates could result from the fish avoiding zooplankton patches, where they are under increased predation risk, by swimming slowly in the waters between zooplankton patches. The combinations of growth rates and daily instantaneous mortality rates generated by the behavioral model are internally consistent with a Lefkovitch matrix population model, which includes an early juvenile stage of a stable and stationary population. Several novel and testable predictions are made by the behavioral model, including: (1) anchovies swim very slowly between zooplankton patch encounters; (2) within a patch fish swim very rapidly while searching for prey; and (3) fish often leave zooplankton patches before totally filling their stomachs. Given these encouraging initial results, the behavioral modeling approach appears to be a valuable technique for examining how potential habitat changes due to global warming may affect fish behavior and populations. Several such scenarios are proposed and discussed.									20	0	0	0	18	0	19			0967-0645	1879-0100		WOS:A1994NK10400006

After experiencing a period of arrested growth, individuals often show compensatory growth responses by modifying their life-history, behaviour and physiology. However, the strength of compensatory responses may vary across broad geographic scales as populations differ in their exposition to varying time constraints. We examined differences in compensatory growth strategies in common frog (Rana temporaria) populations from southern and northern Sweden. Tadpoles from four populations were reared in the laboratory and exposed to low temperature to evaluate the patterns and mechanisms of compensatory growth responses. We determined tadpoles' growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency during the compensation period. In the absence of arrested growth conditions, tadpoles from all the populations showed similar (size-corrected) growth rates, food intake and growth efficiency. After being exposed to low temperature for 1 week, only larvae from the northern populations increased growth rates by increasing both food intake and growth efficiency. These geographic differences in compensatory growth mechanisms suggest that the strategies for recovering after a period of growth deprivation may depend on the strength of time constraints faced by the populations. Due to the costs of fast growth, only populations exposed to the strong time constraints are prone to develop fast recovering strategies in order to metamorphose before conditions deteriorate. Understanding how organisms balance the cost and benefits of growth strategies may help in forecasting the impact of fluctuating environmental conditions on life-history strategies of populations likely to be exposed to increasing environmental variation in the future.									19	1	0	0	19	0	20			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000329624300013	23996230

Invasive species are responsible for substantial economic and ecological losses. Invasive species impact resource availability, outcompeting and even causing extinction of native species. The management of invasive species requires knowledge on the ecology, physiology and population dynamics of these species. In a world where environmental conditions are changing fast due to global climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, a more comprehensive knowledge of the life history and physiology of these species is urgently needed. The DEB theory is unique in capturing the metabolic processes of an organism through its entire life cycle, and thus, is a useful tool to model lifetime feeding, growth, reproduction, and responses to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. In this work, we estimated the parameters of a DEB model for Asterias amurensis. This starfish was introduced in Tasmania and is considered the most serious marine pest in Australia where it has caused local extinctions of several species. Asterias amurensis is a major predator and is a keystone species exerting top-down control of its prey populations by achieving large densities. We determined the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the performance of A. amurensis. The DEB model presented here includes energy handling rules to describe gonad and pyloric caeca cycles. Model parameters were used to explore population dynamics of populations of A. amurensis in Australia. The DEB model allowed us to characterise the ecophysiology of A. amurensis, providing new insights on the role of food availability and temperature on its life cycle and reproduction strategy. Moreover it is a powerful tool for risk management of already established invasive populations and of regions with a high invasion risk.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000437242900009

These phenotypic changes can alter ecological and evolutionary processes; yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying many plastic phenotypic responses remain unknown. Here we show that dopamine signalling through a type-D2 receptor mediates developmental plasticity by regulating arm length in pre-feeding sea urchin larvae in response to food availability. Although prey-induced traits are often thought to improve food acquisition, the mechanism underlying this plastic response acts to reduce feeding structure size and subsequent feeding rate. Consequently, the developmental programme and/or maternal provisioning predetermine the maximum possible feeding rate, and food-induced dopamine signalling reduces food acquisition potential during periods of abundant resources to preserve maternal energetic reserves. Sea urchin larvae may have co-opted the widespread use of food-induced dopamine signalling from behavioural responses to instead alter their development.									42	0	0	0	38	0	43			2041-1723			WOS:000299159900024	22186888

In growth experiments with A. aurita ephyrae fed different species and concentrations of prey organisms (Artemia sp., Balanus sp., Brachionus sp., Rathkea octopunctata), the specific growth rate increased with increasing prey concentration, and a maximum specific growth rate of about 0.22 d(-1) was obtained. For A. aurita medusae fed Acartia tonsa and Artemia sp., maximum growth was about 0.08 d-1. The minimum prey concentration resulting in maximum growth rate was 80 to 100 mu g C l(-1) for ephyrae (depending on prey type), and about 100 mu g C l(-1) for medusae. For S. tubulosa fed different prey concentrations of A. tonsa nauplii, the maximum specific growth rates were 0.32 and 0.1 d(-1) for 2 and 4 mm individuals, respectively, achieved at prey concentrations between 15 and 30 pg C l(-1). Maximum growth rates decreased with initial size in A. aurita and A. vitrina, to become approximately constant at 0.05 to 0.06 d(-1). Clearance rates (F, 1 d(-1)) of A. aurita offered different prey types increased as a function of the umbrella diameter (D, mm) squared, expressed as F = aD(2), where a-value depends on prey type. Both maximum specific growth rate and clearance rate increased exponentially with temperature between 4 and 19 degrees C for ephyrae, and between 8 and 19 degrees C for medusae, but at higher temperatures both growth and clearance decreased markedly. From experiments with A. aurita (both ephyra and medusae) in which growth, ingestion and respiration were measured simultaneously, carbon budgets were constructed for individuals growing at maximum rates when feeding on different prey types. Assimilation efficiency, net growth efficiency, and minimum concentrations of prey organisms needed for sustaining maximum growth were estimated, allowing evaluation of the degree to which jellyfish realize their growth potential in the field, or whether the jellyfish are controlling the zooplankton.									35	1	0	0	31	0	37			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000250472300013

We documented the decline of a previously prolific invasive mudsnail, Batillaria attramentaria, at Elkhorn Slough estuary in central California, USA. The mudsnail was the most abundant epibenthic invertebrate in the estuary, maintaining very high densities for many decades before declining heterogeneously throughout the estuary over the past decade, decreasing in density by three orders of magnitude at some sites. We used field and laboratory experiments to test several possible mechanisms for its demise. We show that the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes can prey heavily on Batillaria. We detected high dissolution rates of Batillaria shells, and we measured greater predation rates on tethered snails with dissolved versus intact shells. Warm water temperatures and high water levels coincided with the period of most dramatic Batillaria declines (2013-2015). Localized water impoundments appear to buffer environmental drivers of the decline because Batillaria remained abundant at sites with artificial tidal restriction, while the population crashed at one site after full tidal exchange was restored. We also investigated trematode parasite prevalence and molluscicide applications to the surrounding watershed as possible causes of mudsnail declines, but they had little explanatory power. Our findings illustrate the potential for population crashes even for long-established introduced species at pest levels of abundance, and demonstrate that such declines can exhibit spatial heterogeneity. Both of these results highlight the value of investigating population dynamics of invaders across multiple temporal and spatial scales.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000508699500001		
J	HIGHSMITH, RC; COYLE, KO								AMPHIPOD LIFE HISTORIES - COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE ON DECOUPLED GROWTH AND MATURATION RATES, PRODUCTIVITY, AND P-B RATIOS								AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST				31	6			861	873						1991	1991	Data are presented on northern Bering Sea benthic amphipod growth rates and age at maturity, indicating that high latitude species grow slowly, require 2 to 4 years to mature, reach a large size, and have long lifespans. Data are also presented demonstrating predation by benthic amphipods on newly metamorphosed juveniles of a potential space competitor, the northern sand dollar Echinarachnius parma. Such facultative predation by the predominantly herbivorous amphipods may, in part, explain the existence of alterative benthic communities in the eastern Bering Sea. Incorporation of the high latitude results into a review of benthic amphipod life histories revealed several important patterns. Amphipod growth rates and molting rates appear to be decoupled, resulting in small adults at warm temperatures and large adults at lower temperatures. We posit that molting rate is temperature-sensitive, that at warm temperatures molting occurs rapidly regardless of limited instar tissue growth, and that the amphipods reach sexual maturity after a fixed number of molts. Alternatively, gonad development is also temperature-dependent and may drive maturation, regardless of the number of molts experienced. Amphipods have linear or exponential growth rates, as opposed to the familiar asymptotic curve. Consequently, secondary production is highly dependent upon the proportion of large individuals in the population, in contrast to organisms with asymptotic growth in which production is largely determined by the proportion of young, growing individuals present. Production in amphipods is significantly correlated with standing stock. P:B ratios are not correlated with production in amphipods, and probably are not in other organisms with linear or exponential growth rates, and thus appear to have no comparative value other than as a possible index of generation times.

Using three experimental temperatures (20.0 degrees, 23.3 degrees, 26.6 degrees C), we determined that the developmental times of all three populations significantly decreased with increasing temperature. Additionally, the number of aphids consumed per day significantly increased from the lowest to the highest experimental temperatures for each population. There were few differences among the three populations for the aspects studied, although one population of L. gaimarii had a significantly (P = 0.005) longer third stadium (and total larval duration) at the lowest experimental temperature than either L. ninae or the other population of L. gaimarii. This coincided with a higher mean number of aphids consumed for this population at this temperature. Most importantly, we found that these Leucopis species are voracious predators on aphids, with each individual killing approximately 100 aphids throughout larval life. Also, our data suggests that the species native to the Pacific Northwest, L. gaimarii, is as effective a predator on the Russian wheat aphid as the introduced species, L. ninae.									8	0	0	0	9	0	9			0013-8797			WOS:A1996VT19100006

Recent studies have shown substantial reductions in aerobic performance in some teleost fish species, but no change or even enhanced performance in others. Notably lacking, however, are studies on the effects of near-future CO2 conditions on larger meso and apex predators, such as elasmobranchs. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) lives on shallow coral reef flats and in lagoons, where it may frequently encounter short-term periods of environmental hypoxia and elevated CO2, especially during nocturnal low tides. Indeed, H. ocellatum is remarkably tolerant to short periods (hours) of hypoxia, and possibly hypercapnia, but nothing is known about its response to prolonged exposure. We exposed H. ocellatum individuals to control (390 mu atm) or one of two near-future CO2 treatments (600 or 880 mu atm) for a minimum of 60 days and then measured key aspects of their respiratory physiology, namely the resting oxygen consumption rate, which is used to estimate resting metabolic rate, and critical oxygen tension, a proxy for hypoxia sensitivity. Neither of these respiratory attributes was affected by the long-term exposure to elevated CO2. Furthermore, there was no change in citrate synthase activity, a cellular indicator of aerobic energy production. Plasma bicarbonate concentrations were significantly elevated in sharks exposed to 600 and 880 mu atm CO2 treatments, indicating that acidosis was probably prevented by regulatory changes in acid-base relevant ions. Epaulette sharks may therefore possess adaptations that confer tolerance to CO2 levels projected to occur in the ocean by the end of this century. It remains uncertain whether other elasmobranchs, especially pelagic species that do not experience such diurnal fluctuations in their environment, will be equally tolerant.									30	0	0	0	27	0	30			2051-1434			WOS:000209703800029	27293668	
J	Zhao, Jiyan; Yang, Yangheshan; Xi, Xinqiang; Sun, Shucun								Artificial warming increases size at metamorphosis in plateau frogs (Rana kukunoris) in the presence of predators								AQUATIC ECOLOGY				48	4			423	434		10.1007/s10452-014-9495-y				DEC 2014	2014	Global warming may induce significant changes in species life history traits particularly in amphibians, which are characterized by complex and plastic life cycles. Because both warming and predators are often suggested to reduce size at metamorphosis in amphibians, we hypothesized that the size at metamorphosis was further reduced by experimental warming in the presence of predators. We conducted a factorial-designed experiment involving two factors and two levels (warmed vs. ambient, lethal predator absence vs. presence, resulting in four treatments) using Rana kukunoris tadpoles in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and we examined its behavioral, growth, and developmental responses to warming in the presence and absence of predatory beetles (Agabus sp.) for 13 weeks. During the course of the experiment, a similar level of tadpole mortality due to the diving beetles was found between ambient and warmed treatments, but the warming effect on size at metamorphosis depended on whether the predators were present or absent. In the absence of predators, warming did not significantly increase tadpole growth but advanced the timing of metamorphosis, such that size at metamorphosis of forelimb emergence and tail resorption was much reduced in terms of body fresh weight. In the presence of predators, warming increased tadpole growth rate much more than the development rate (as reflected by duration of the tadpole stage), and therefore the size at metamorphosis was significantly increased. The significant effect of the interaction between predator and warming on the size at metamorphosis could be attributed to the tadpole response in the frequencies of feeding, resting, and swimming to the predator activity level, which was in turn increased by warming. We suggest that warming-induced changes in life history traits should be studied in relation to species interaction so as to accurately predict ecological response of amphibians to the future warmed world.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1386-2588	1573-5125		WOS:000344800800006

Hypotheses based on physical constraints or behavioural plasticity predict relationships between the speed and the tortuosity of running, which should affect the thermal sensitivity of locomotion.We measured the speed and tortuosity of running by leaf-cutter ants over a range of temperatures from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Tortuosity was estimated by the fractal dimension of each path.As we expected, ants ran faster at higher temperatures, but they also followed straighter (less tortuous) paths. A negative relationship between speed and tortuosity was observed both within and among thermal environments.Both biomechanical and behavioural mechanisms might have caused the observed relationship. Turning at high speeds should be more difficult because of the force needed to overcome inertia, and turning at low speeds could help ants evade a predator. Staged encounters with predators should help to define the ecological significance of the trade-off between speed and tortuosity.									26	0	0	0	24	1	26			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000252443600010

In order to maximize the food supply and maintain the population of predators, it is very important to understand the effects of bran moisture content (BMC) and initial population density (IPD) on mass production of T. putrescentiae. In the current study, the population increase of T. putrescentiae under six BMCs and five IPDs were evaluated at optimal temperature and humidity with suitable photoperiod conditions. The results showed that the population growth rates of T. putrescentiae were significantly higher with higher BMC. The population increased by 8, 32, 72, 304 times within five weeks under different BMC which was 8.3%, 10%, 15%, 20%, respectively. Unfortunately, when BMC reached to 25%, there was a great amount of mildew growing other than the mites. In the case of IPD, about 10000 adult mites per 100 g bran resulted in the largest final population of T. putrescentiae. However, either lower or higher IPD led to a smaller final population. It was also concluded that population growth rate decreased while the initial density was increasing, ranging from 1,055, 601, 397, 266, 109 times under initial density of similar to 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000 adult mites per 100 g bran, respectively. Besides, we also described a method in detail for the effective isolation and counting of mites from bran. We found that population growth grew to maximum (over 50,000 mites / bran per gram) under BMC of 20%, IPD of similar to 50 adults /bran per gram, temperature of 28 +/- 1 degrees C, 80 +/- 5% R.H. and photoperiod of all darkness, which could be the best condition for mass production of T. putrescentiae. Our results provide basic biological information for the mass rearing of the mold mite, which will maintain stable and controllable food source for the predatory mites.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1362-1971			WOS:000359063000006

We present results obtained with three different modelling approaches: (i) an individual-based model of animal spatial behavior; (ii) a continuous taxis-diffusion-reaction system of partial-difference equations; (iii) a 'hybrid' approach combining the individual-based algorithm of organism movements with explicit description of decay and diffusion of the movement stimuli. Though the models are based on extremely simple rules, they all allow description of spatial movements of animals in a predator-prey system within a closed habitat, reproducing some typical patterns of the pursuit-evasion behavior observed in natural populations. In all three models, at each spatial position the animal movements are determined by local conditions only, so the pattern of collective behavior emerges due to self-organization. The movement velocities of animals are proportional to the density gradients of specific cues emitted by individuals of the antagonistic species (pheromones, exometabolites or mechanical waves of the media, e.g., sound). These cues play a role of taxis stimuli: prey attract predators, while predators repel prey. Depending on the nature and the properties of the movement stimulus we propose using either a simplified individual-based model, a continuous taxis pursuit-evasion system, or a little more detailed 'hybrid' approach that combines simulation of the individual movements with the continuous model describing diffusion and decay of the stimuli in an explicit way. These can be used to improve movement models for many species, including large marine predators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lapota, D; Rosen, G; Chock, J; Liu, CH								Red and green abalone seed growout for reseeding activities off Point Loma, California								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				19	1			431	438						JUN 2000	2000	California has a statewide closure on harvest of any abalone species from San Diego County north to San Francisco. Prior to closure, harvests of the main species that compose the fishery (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822; the green abalone, Haliotis fulgens Philippi 1845; and the pink abalone, Haliotis corrugata Gray 1828) had plummeted to an all-time low of several hundred thousand pounds per year. Overfishing and several diseases identified recently in abalone are creating concern within the industry with respect to the recovery of the fishery. One method being considered to restore the fishery on a limited basis is reseeding. Reseeding success is dependent on many factors. including planting location and techniques of seed placement. Other important factors include the abundance and nutritive quality of macroalgae (kelp) available to the abalone, the seawater temperature requirement of the species being seeded, the size of the seed being planted, and the presence of potential predators within the seed site. In this study, we observed that shell growth and weight gain in juvenile red and green abalone are temperature-dependent. When constant, elevated temperatures are maintained, growth rates improved as compared to growth rates in animals kept at the lower temperatures normally found. More growth in juvenile red abalone was observed at 19 degrees C, with an average daily shell growth of 0.1 mm/day. Previous work suggested that Egregia laevigata, a brown kelp was a superior food source for juvenile abalone; however, the growth rates of I rd abalone fed Egregia increased minimally compared to growth rates of juvenile red abalone fed another brown kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Maximum sustained shell growth of 0.16 mm/day in juvenile green abalone was observed at a culture temperature of 21 degrees C. Extrapolations of these growth rates for an entire year indicate growth of 36 mm/y for red abalone and 60 mm/y for green abalone, Growth predictions based on laboratory-reared juveniles will vary from those observed in wild populations since seawater temperatures are not static along the coast and may vary as much as 10-12 degrees C during the year. The nutritional value of kelp and other algae may be as important as temperature in the effect on growth observed in the laboratory and in the field. Increased growth rates exhibited by juvenile red abalone during the period from January through April 1977 may be reflective of changing nutrient ratios or levels in kelp that are otherwise limiting during reduced or non-upwelling months. We are presently culturing hatchery-produced red and green abalone seed for eventual planting in the U.S, Department of the Interior's Cabrillo National Monument. The seed are approximately 45 mm in size and are fed a mixed kelp diet. They will be transplanted when they are approximately 75-100 mm in size. Reseeding success assessed by annual dive surveys should help determine if planting larger animals increases survival of brood stock and increases recruitment within the monument area.

Specifically, we study the stochastic dynamics of arthropod predator-prey interactions under a varying temperature regime, and we develop an individual model of a prey under pressure from a predator, with vigilance (or foraging effort), search rates, attack rates, and other predation parameters dependent on daily temperature variations. Simulations suggest that an increase in the daily average tempera ture may benefit both predator and prey. Furthermore, simulations show that anti-predator behavior may indeed decrease predation but at the expense of reduced prey survivorship because of a greater increase in other types of mortality.

As Neoseiulus species are valuable predator mites, N. bicaudus could be used for biocontrol of some small pests like spider mites, whitefly, and thrips. Tetranychus turkestani (Ugarov et Nikolskii) is the main spider mite affecting agriculture and forestry in Xinjiang. The development rate and reproductive biology of N. bicaudus feeding on T. turkestani were studied at six constant temperatures: 18 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 29 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. The duration of the egg, larva, protonymph, total immature, and pre-oviposition stages all decreased as temperatures increased from 18 degrees C to 32 degrees C and then increased slightly as temperatures increased from 32 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The mean generation time (6.95 days) and the shortest time for the population to double (1.70 days) were observed at 35 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) and the finite rate of increase (lambda) both were larger as temperature increased, reaching their maxima at 35 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0 = 34.60) also reached a maximum at 26 degrees C. The maximum daily fecundity (2.55 eggs/day/female) and the maximum daily female fecundity (1.69 female eggs/day/female) were both observed at 26 degrees C. The results showed that N. bicaudus could complete its development at the six temperatures used in this study. Both the developmental duration as well as the time needed for the population to double decreased as temperature increased. As temperature increased, the duration of the oviposition period first increased and then decreased. The optimal development and reproduction temperature of N. bicaudus preying on T. turkestani is approximately 26 degrees C.									9	7	0	0	15	0	17			1362-1971			WOS:000359063000004

In temperate lakes, large-sized herbivores such as Daphnia magna are used to control cyanobacterial blooms. The cladoceran, Simocephalus mixtus and the amphipod, Hyalella azteca are common in tropical and sub-tropical aquatic systems. Since both species are generalist feeders, we tested their ability to consume uni-cellular Microcystis sp. and Chlorella at different temperatures. Feeding rates and filtration rates at different temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) were quantified on diets of Chlorella vulgaris and Microcystis sp.; each diet separately at different concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0x10(6) cell mL(-1)). Both the crustaceans were able to consume C. vulgaris and Microcystis sp. although at different rates depending on the food concentration and temperature. At 25 degrees C and a Microcystis sp. concentration of 2.0x10(6) cells mL(-1), H. azteca fed up to 60x10(4) cells ind(-1) h(-1) of Microcystis sp. which was even greater than its feeding rate on C. vulgaris. Simocephalus was able to consume Microcystis sp. although at significantly lower rates as compared to C. vulgaris. Our experiments show that H. azteca can feed well on Microcystis sp.. Combined with control in fish predation pressure, both crustacean species could be used in top-down control, but further investigation on a large scale with these organisms is necessary to propose new alternatives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0923-4861	1572-9834		WOS:000471654100012

Acoustic monitoring indicates a correlation between calling and spawning in captive spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus)								PEERJ				5						e2944	10.7717/peerj.2944				FEB 9 2017	2017	Background. Fish sound production is widespread throughout many families. Territorial displays and courtship are the most common reasons for fish sound production. Yet, there is still some questions on how acoustic signaling and reproduction are correlated in many sound-producing species. In the present study, our aim was to determine if a quantitative relationship exists between calling and egg deposition in captive spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus). This type of data is essential if passive acoustics is to be used to identify spawning aggregations over large spatial scales and monitor reproductive activity over annual and decadal timeframes.Methods. Acoustic recorders (i.e., DSG-Oceans) were placed in three laboratory tanks to record underwater sound over an entire, simulated reproductive season. We enumerated the number of calls, calculated the received sound pressure level, and counted the number of eggs every morning in each tank.Results. Spotted seatrout produced three distinct call types characterized as "drums," "grunts," and "staccatos." Spotted seatrout calling increased as the light cycle shifted from 13.5 to 14.5 h of light, and the temperature increased to 27.7 degrees C. Calling decreased once the temperature fell below 27.7 degrees C, and the light cycle shifted to 12 h of light. These temperature and light patterns followed the natural reproductive season observed in wild spotted seatrout in the Southeast United States. Spotted seatrout exhibited daily rhythms in calling. Acoustic signaling began once the lights turned off, and calling reached maximum activity approximately 3 h later. Eggs were released only on evenings in which spotted seatrout were calling. In all tanks, spotted seatrout were more likely to spawn when male fish called more frequently. A positive relationship between SPL and the number of eggs collected was found in Tanks 1 and 3.Discussion. Our findings indicate that acoustic metrics can predict spawning potential. These findings are important because plankton tows may not accurately reflect spawning locations since egg capture is likely affected by predator activity and water currents. Instead, passive acoustics could be used to monitor spotted seatrout reproduction. Future studies can use this captive study as a model to record the estuarine soundscape precisely over long time periods to better understand how human-made stressors (e.g., climate change, noise pollution, and chemical pollutants) may affect spawning patterns.									15	1	0	0	15	0	16			2167-8359			WOS:000396898400002	28289557

The relationship between the body size of both sexes was allometric with female-biased sexual size dimorphism. Body size of males did not change with latitude or temperature, while that of females changed significantly with temperature. Larger females were found in regions with higher temperature which is presumably a result of an optimal climate: higher temperature and longer season provide higher prey availability which accelerates the growth rate of females, leading to a larger body size. As female size varied more than male size, a sexual size dimorphism cline was observed in Z. rubidum. Larger sexual size dimorphism was found in warmer regions. These results thus suggest that environmental conditions (temperature) influence intraspecific variation in sexual size dimorphism in Z. rubidum.									5	0	0	0	6	1	6			0022-2933			WOS:000241266500005

Elgin, Ashley/0000-0001-5728-9843			Evaluating consumptive and nonconsumptive predator effects on prey density using field time-series data								ECOLOGY				100	3					e02583	10.1002/ecy.2583				MAR 2019	2019	Determining the degree to which predation affects prey abundance in natural communities constitutes a key goal of ecological research. Predators can affect prey through both consumptive effects (CEs) and nonconsumptive effects (NCEs), although the contributions of each mechanism to the density of prey populations remain largely hypothetical in most systems. Common statistical methods applied to time-series data cannot elucidate the mechanisms responsible for hypothesized predator effects on prey density (e.g., differentiate CEs from NCEs), nor can they provide parameters for predictive models. State-space models (SSMs) applied to time-series data offer a way to meet these goals. Here, we employ SSMs to assess effects of an invasive predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, on an important prey species, Daphnia mendotae, in Lake Michigan. We fit mechanistic models in an SSM framework to seasonal time series (1994-2012) using a recently developed, maximum-likelihood-based optimization method, iterated filtering, which can overcome challenges in ecological data (e.g., nonlinearities, measurement error, and irregular sampling intervals). Our results indicate that B. longimanus strongly influences D. mendotae dynamics, with mean annual peak densities of B. longimanus observed in Lake Michigan estimated to cause a 61% reduction in D. mendotae population growth rate and a 59% reduction in peak biomass density. Further, the observed B. longimanus effect is most consistent with an NCE via reduced birth rates. The SSM approach also provided estimates for key biological parameters (e.g., demographic rates) and the contribution of dynamic stochasticity and measurement error. Our study therefore provides evidence derived directly from survey data that the invasive zooplankter B. longimanus is affecting zooplankton demographics and offer parameter estimates needed to inform predictive models that explore the effect of B. longimanus under different scenarios, such as climate change.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000460163500017	30565223

We conducted experiments to determine whether checkered pufferfish (Sphoeroides testudineus), which were collected from a dynamic (in terms of depth and water temperature) tidal mangrove creek environment in The Bahamas, have consistent individual-level differences in locomotor activity and the response to a simulated predator threat, as well as swimming performance and puffing in response to stressors. The relationships between personality and performance traits were evaluated to determine whether they represented stress-coping styles or syndromes. Subsequently, a displacement study was conducted to determine how personality and performance in the laboratory compared to movements in the field. In addition, we tested whether a physiological dose of the stress hormone cortisol would alter individual consistency in behavioural and performance traits. We found that pufferfish exhibited consistent individual differences in personality traits over time (e.g., activity and the duration of a response to a threat) and that performance was consistent between the lab and the natural enclosure. Locomotor activity and the duration of startled behaviour were not associated with swimming and puffing performance. Locomotor activity, puffing performance, and swimming performance were not related to whether fish returned to the tidal creek of capture after displacement. Similarly, a cortisol treatment did not modify behaviour or performance in the laboratory. The results reveal that consistent individual-level differences in behaviour and performance were present in a population from a fluctuating and physiologically challenging environment but that such traits are not necessarily correlated. We also determined that certain individual performance traits were repeatable between the lab and a natural enclosure. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between exogenous cortisol levels and behavioural traits or performance in these fish, which suggests that other internal and external mechanisms may underlie the behaviours and performance tested.

Therefore, the purpose of the present laboratory work was to obtain experimental data on prey consumption during development as well as longevity and reproduction of T. pyri on apple leaf discs and in Plexiglas cells at constant temperatures of 25 +/- 2 degreesC and 30 +/- 2 degreesC with P. ulmi as prey.The results showed that mean daily and total prey consumption by both the nymphs and adults of T. pyri decreased significantly on both the arenas as the temperature was increased from 25 degreesC to 30 degreesC, whereby adult prey consumption, both mean daily and total, was higher than that of nymphs. Prey consumption by both the nymphs and adults was significantly higher in the Plexiglas cells than on the leaf discs at both temperatures. Mean total prey consumption during nymphal development was 16.1 (femalefemale) and 12.8 (malemale) at 25 degreesC compared to 7.0 (femalefemale) and 5.8 (malemale) preys at 30 degreesC on the apple leaf discs and 46.0 (femalefemale) and 38.5 (malemale) at 25 degreesC compared to 25.2 (femalefemale) and 20.3 (malemale) preys at 30 degreesC in the Plexiglas cells. Mean duration of nymphal development was similar for the two sexes at the same temperature, but it was longer at 25 degreesC than at 30 degreesC. It was 6.0 and 4.0 days on the apple leaf discs while 7.0 and 6.0 days in the Plexiglas cells at 25 degreesC and 30 degreesC, respectively. Mean daily and total prey consumption by both male and female adults also decreased with the increasing temperature, whereby the females consumed more than double the mean total number of prey than the males on both the arenas of observation and at both temperatures: 355.4 versus 149.7 preys at 25 degreesC and 192.2 versus 85.6 preys at 30 degreesC on the leaf discs and 826.8 versus 374.5 preys at 25 degreesC and 488.9 versus 187.9 preys at 30 degreesC in the Plexiglas cells. Longevity of the females was longer than males on both arenas and at both temperatures and it was longer at 25 degreesC than at 30 degreesC. Mean total longevity on the apple leaf discs was 68.3 (femalefemale) and 50.8 (malemale) days at 25 degreesC compared to 52.5 (femalefemale) and 36.8 (malemale) days at 30 degreesC, while in the Plexiglas cells it was 91.0 (femalefemale) and 65.8 (malemale) days at 25 degreesC compared to 75.3 (femalefemale) and 48.5 (malemale) days at 30 degreesC. Reproduction in females also decreased significantly with increasing temperature. It decreased from 62.0 to 39.0 eggs/female on the leaf discs and 75.0 to 47.1 eggs/female in the Plexiglas cells. The females laid significantly higher numbers of eggs at both temperatures in the Plexiglas cells than on the leaf discs. Oviposition period in females was 30 days at 25 degreesC on both the arenas, while at 30 degreesC it was 26 days on the apple leaf discs and 27 days in the Plexiglas cells.									11	0	0	0	13	0	14			1436-5693			WOS:000183191600001

The study coincided with a bloom of the haptophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii in the colonial form. Copepods dominated the zooplankton community numerically, and were mainly distributed within the upper 150 m (except for Metridia longa and Oithona spp., that inhabited deeper waters), without showing a clear avoidance of the P. pouchetii layer. Copepod diet was diverse, ciliates having a relevant share (40% of the diet). Copepods also displayed active grazing upon the colonies of P. pouchetii. In general, feeding rates were low (on average, daily ration was 1.6% of body carbon), likely due to the scarcity of nano and microplankton during the study ( < 100 mu g C L-1). Consequently, the trophic impacts on both the nano- and microplankton standing stocks and on primary production were negligible. These results suggest that during the period of study the transfer of carbon and energy from lower trophic levels towards copepods was low. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Apparent survival and density of the dominant Atlantic coast salt marsh fish, the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, were estimated in four North Carolina tidal creeks using a model simultaneously fitted to mark-resight and mark-recapture data. Rates of weekly loss (mortality plus emigration) were high (similar to 10%). Sampling for tagged fish within and outside of study creeks showed high site fidelity to each creek, indicating that loss largely resulted from mortality rather than emigration. Estimated rates of apparent survival were lowest in the creek with the least instream- and watershed-level impacts. This creek has direct (non-culvert) access downstream to a larger waterbody, suggesting that enhanced access by predators and/or greater rates of permanent emigration may have contributed to lower apparent survival in this creek. There was a positive relation between minnow trap catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and density allowing the relationship between CPUE and habitat and urbanization to be examined in a total of six creeks. The largest CPUE estimates occurred early in each growing season and were associated with creeks possessing characteristics most representative of undisturbed salt marsh mosaics: high percentage of marsh coverage instream and downstream and high percentage of marsh edge. Given generally limited movement outside of creeks, differences in abundance among creeks likely result from different levels of recruitment that are related to salt marsh availability. Priority preservation of salt marsh habitats may be warranted by natural resource planners to maintain abundance levels of this trophically important species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000478058300016

In this way, environmental changes affect animalplant interactions. In this study, we assessed the effect of temperature on a tritrophic system of the lima bean, the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. In this system, the plant defends itself against T.urticae by emitting volatiles that attract P.persimilis. Over 2040 degrees C, the emission of volatiles by infested plants and the subsequent attraction of P.persimilis peaked at 30 degrees C, but the number of eggs laid by T.urticae adults and the number of eggs consumed by P.persimilis peaked at 35 degrees C. This indicates that the spider mites and predatory mites performed best at a higher temperature than that at which most volatile attractants were produced. Our data from transcriptome pyrosequencing of the mites found that P.persimilis up-regulated gene families for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and ubiquitin-associated proteins, whereas T.urticae did not. RNA interference-mediated gene suppression in P.persimilis revealed differences in temperature responses. Predation on T.urticae eggs by P.persimilis that had been fed PpHsp70-1 dsRNA was low at 35 degrees C but not at 25 degrees C when PpHsp70-1 expression was very high. Overall, our molecular and behavioural approaches revealed that the mode and tolerance of lima bean, T.urticae and P.persimilis are distinctly affected by temperature variability, thereby making their tritrophic interactions temperature dependent.									19	0	0	0	16	1	19			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000310583800020	23043221

Not only has the number of agent species increased, but new manipulation techniques for natural enemies have also been empirically introduced, particularly in greenhouse crops. This makes biocontrol more complex, requiring a new mathematical modeling approach appropriate for the optimization of the release of agents. The present paper aimed at filling this gap by the development of a temperature- and stage-dependent dynamic mathematical model of the host-parasitoid system with an improved functional response. The model is appropriate not only for simulation analysis of the efficiency of biocontrol agents, but also for the application of optimal control methodology for the optimal timing of agent releases, and for the consideration of economic implications. Based on both laboratory and greenhouse trials, the model was validated and fitted to the data of Chelonus oculator (F.) (Hym.: Braconidae) as a biological control agent against the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lep.: Noctuidae). We emphasize that this model can be easily adapted to other interacting species involved in biological or integrated pest control with either parasitoid or predator agents.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000354621500013

AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS				21	7			658	675		10.1002/aqc.1225				NOV-DEC 2011	2011	1. The response of fish, sea urchins, benthic cover, herbivory, and predation on sea urchins were studied over a 14-year period in and out of a recently established fully closed and fished atoll reef lagoon of the remote Glover's Reef, Belize.2. Closure from fishing was predicted to result in the recovery of predatory fish and herbivores, herbivory rates, and subsequently reduce erect algae and lead to the recovery of herbivore resistant and calcifying taxa such as hard corals and calcifying algae. Recovery of predatory fishes was the largest response to closure and the herbivore response was weak and no corals and calcifying algae changed in the predicted direction.3. Hard corals declined where they were most abundant and all sites appear to have reached a stable point of similar to 15% cover by the end of the study. Generalized and possibly opportunistic carnivores, such as jacks, barracuda, groupers, snappers, grunts, and sparids showed the greatest increases and there was a trend towards more small-bodied herbivores such sea urchins and damselfish in the open and a slight gain in large herbivores in the closed area, but this had little effect in increasing total herbivory.4. Factors that may have influenced this unexpected response include: (1) a complex food web that did not produce a simple cascade response; (2) attenuation of the cascade effect towards the lower trophic levels; (3) insufficient compliance, closure time, and space; (4) a post- rather than pre-disturbance establishment of the closure; 5) habitat or site specificity; and (6) overriding environmental disturbances, such as oceanographic oscillations and a warming climate.5. The results suggest a need to further evaluate fisheries management systems, contingencies, and interventions that will promote coral reef resilience to climate change and ecosystem sustainability.

GTLAUS is not a prediction model for practical plant protection, bur a tool for analysis of the interaction of different pest and antagonist densities and ecological effects of changing climate and other environmental conditions. The model contains three submodels: wheat ontogenesis, popular-ion dynamics of the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae (FABR.), and population dynamics and predation of aphid-specific predators, especially Coccinella septempunctata L. Several functions for certain features, e.g. grain yield loss and aphid mortality due to parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi, were also incorporated into the model. A large number of scenario runs with various initial population densities and different weather regimes were analyzed to quantify aphid population development under certain conditions and antagonist potential for natural control. Age structure variation in the initial aphid population leads to markable differences in population growth race. Temperatures 3K higher than the long-term German mean temperature were found to give especially C. septempunctata a relative predatory advantage compared with aphid multiplication. Natural control, therefore, increases even clearly so. The model calculations also showed that the impact of beneficials varies greatly, depending primarily on aphid density and temperature. Lower temperatures may favour aphids for seasons of prolonged wheat ripening and weaker predator activity.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			0340-8159			WOS:A1996VV72600013

Sampling of larvae and juveniles of H. aff. malabaricus has been conducted during the period from November 1991 through February 1995, with 42 sampling stations distributed in four sub-areas: Ivinhema I, Ivinhema II, Baía, and Paraná. During the same period, data were obtained for water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, river level, precipitation index, and photoperiod. The largest catches of larvae were in the Ivinhema I sub-area (47.06%), and of juveniles in the Paraná sub-area (54.55%). Larvae and juveniles were caught from October to February. Larvae were mainly collected at night and in all types of environments sampled (lotic, semi-lotic, and lentic). Principal Component Analysis of the environmental parameters and larval density showed that the largest catches were obtained in dry season months, with low values for temperature, electrical conductivity, river level, and photoperiod, and with high concentrations of dissolved oxygen and pH. This reproductive strategy may minimizes predation and maximizes food utilization, as it enables the fish to reach advanced developmental stages, while most other species are spawning.		Analisou-se a distribuição espaço-temporal de larvas e juvenis de Hoplias aff. malabaricus (Erythrinidae) na planície de inundação do alto rio Paraná e suas relações com algumas variáveis ambientais, verificando-se os habitats preferenciais para a reprodução e desenvolvimento inicial. As amostragens foram divididas em quatro fases realizadas durante o período de novembro de 1991 a fevereiro de 1995, sendo estabelecidas 42 estações de coleta distribuídas em 4 subáreas (Ivinhema I, Ivinhema II, Baía e Paraná). As coletas foram realizadas na coluna de água e na vegetação aquática marginal. Durante o período foram obtidos dados de temperatura da água, oxigênio dissolvido, pH, condutividade elétrica, nível fluviométrico, índice pluviométrico e fotoperíodo. As maiores capturas de larvas foram verificadas na subárea Ivinhema I (47,06%) e, de juvenis, na subárea Paraná (54,55%). As larvas foram encontradas entre outubro e fevereiro em todas as subáreas, já os juvenis foram encontrados até abril. As larvas foram capturadas principalmente durante o período noturno em todos os tipos de ambientes amostrados (lótico, semilótico e lêntico). A Análise de Componentes Principais, aplicada entre as variáveis ambientais e a densidade de larvas, revelou que as maiores capturas são obtidas em meses em que predominam baixos valores de temperatura, condutividade elétrica, nível fluviométrico e fotoperíodo e elevadas concentrações de oxigênio dissolvido e de pH, ou seja, em meses de seca. Esta estratégia reprodutiva minimiza a predação e maximiza o aproveitamento alimentar, uma vez que lhe permite alcançar estágios avançados enquanto a maioria das espécies está desovando.							14	0	0	0	17	7	16			1678-4375			SCIELO:S1519-69842002000200004	12489393

Chronic exposure to pollutants is thought to compromise survival rate and long-term reproductive outputs in these long-lived organisms, thus inducing population decline. However, the demographic consequences of contaminant exposure are largely theoretical because of the dearth of long-term datasets. This study aims to test whether adult survival rate, return to the colony and long-term breeding performance were related to blood mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), by using a capture-mark-recapture dataset on the vulnerable wandering albatross Diomedea exulans. We did not find evidence for any effect of contaminants on adult survival probability. However, blood Hg and POPs negatively impacted long-term breeding probability, hatching and fledging probabilities. The proximate mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects are likely multifaceted, through physiological perturbations and interactions with reproductive costs. Using matrix population models, we projected a demographic decline in response to an increase in Hg or POPs concentrations. This decline in population growth rate could be exacerbated by other anthropogenic perturbations, such as climate change, disease and fishery bycatch. This study gives a new dimension to the overall picture of environmental threats to wildlife populations.									47	0	0	0	45	0	47			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000338335800005	24920477	
J	Mitchell, Allegra; Bergmann, Philip J.								Thermal and moisture habitat preferences do not maximize jumping performance in frogs								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				30	5			733	742		10.1111/1365-2435.12535				MAY 2016	2016	1. Amphibians are suffering population declines globally, and understanding how environmental parameters influence their thermal and moisture preferences and performance at various tasks is crucial to understanding how these animals will be influenced by climate change.2. Body temperature and hydration affect organismal performance at many fitness-related tasks. Since amphibians are ectotherms with highly water-permeable skin, environmental temperature and moisture directly affect their body temperature and hydration. Therefore, amphibians should select habitats with the optimal combination of temperature and moisture to perform tasks necessary for survival. However, interactions between environmental temperature and moisture can influence habitat selection and task performance in different and often unpredictable ways, and this has only infrequently been considered.3. We tested for interactions between environmental temperature, moisture and organismal hydration on temperature and moisture preferences and jumping performance in green frogs (Lithobates clamitans) in the laboratory, using thermal and moisture gradients, and high-speed video and force plate data. We then integrated the laboratory experiments with field data.4. In the thermal and moisture gradients, frogs selected environmental conditions that minimized cutaneous evaporative water loss, hydroregulating more stringently than thermoregulating. These results are consistent with frogs in the field, which had highly variable body temperatures, but were always hydrated above 95% of their standard mass. However, conditions that minimized evaporative water loss frequently did not maximize jumping performance because warmer temperatures conferred greater performance.5. The ecology of L. clamitans may explain the discrepancy between their preferences and jumping performance optima because the frogs remain in wet environments that serve as refuges from dehydration. In parts of their range where frogs are subjected to warmer and drier conditions, they are likely to select microhabitats that minimize the risk of dehydration, possibly at the expense of their ability to forage and escape from predators.									19	0	0	0	19	0	19			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000375941800007

The model has been developed as an integral part within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for production and biomass of bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), as well as zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The LakeWeb-model is based on ordinary differential equations (the ecosystem perspective) and gives seasonal variations (the calculation time, dt, is 1 week and Euler's integration method has been applied). The sub-model for phytoplankton presented in this work is meant to account for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks (including predation by herbivorous zooplankton) for lakes in general. The model has not been tested in the traditional way using data from a few well investigated lakes. Instead, it has been tested using empirical regressions based on data from many lakes. The basic aim of this dynamic model is that it should capture typical functional and structural patterns in many lakes. It accounts for how variations in (1) lake phosphorus concentrations, (2) water clarity, (3) lake morphometry, (4) water temperature, (5) lake pH and (6) predation by herbivorous zooplankton influence production and biomass of phytoplankton. An important demand for this model is that it should be driven by variables easily accessed from standard monitoring programs and maps (the driving variables are: total phosphorus, colour, pH, lake mean depth, lake area, and epilimnetic temperatures). We have demonstrated that the new model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical regressions, and also expected and requested divergences from these regression lines when they do not provide sufficient resolution.

J	Chi, Baojie; Zheng, Xuan; Liang, Xiaochen; Liu, Yong				Chi, Baojie/AAF-9347-2020				Temperature-dependent demography of Agriphila aeneociliella (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a new insect pest of wheat in China								AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY				18	3			189	197		10.1111/afe.12151				AUG 2016	2016	1 Agriphila aeneociliella (Eversmann) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) was newly reported in China in 2010. Its larvae severely damage wheat in early spring and cause substantial economic losses in wheat crops.2 The present study involves a detailed study of the demography of A. aeneociliella based on the age-stage, two-sex life table. The developmental threshold and the effective accumulated temperature have been calculated for each developmental stage.3 Individuals were found to have either six or seven instars, with the percentage of seven-instar larvae increasing at higher temperatures.4 The total pre-adult development time ranged from 119.67 days at 25 degrees C to 147.26 days at 18 degrees C. The highest pre-adult survival rate was 72.60% at 18 degrees C, whereas the highest mean fecundity was 495.53 eggs per female at 25 degrees C. The highest growth rates (r = 0.0368 day(-1), lambda = 1.0375 day(-1)) were observed at 23 degrees C, whereas the shortest mean generation time (T = 127.67 days) occurred at 25 degrees C. No significant differences were found in population parameters between cohorts raised at 23 and 25 degrees C.5 The present study provides a basis for understanding the population ecology of A. aeneociliella and can be instrumental in constructing future integrated pest management programmes against this widespread pest.									4	1	0	0	4	0	5			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000379423700001		
J	Billman, Eric J.; Wagner, Eric J.; Arndt, Ronney E.								Effects of temperature on the survival and growth of age-0 least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis)								WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST				66	4			434	440		10.3398/1527-0904(2006)66[434:EOTOTS]2.0.CO;2				OCT 2006	2006	Larval and juvenile stages of many fishes require nursery habitats that provide optimal conditions for growth. Loss or degradation of these habitats limits recruitment, causing population and species declines. Least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis), an endemic cyprinid in the Bonneville Basin, is currently restricted to a few spring complexes in Utah. This species utilizes the warm shallow spring margins as spawning and rearing habitat throughout the summer. This study was conducted to determine effects of temperature on survival and growth of age-0 least chub to understand the importance of temperature in selection of spring margins as rearing habitat. Age-0 least chub were exposed to 5 temperatures (14 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 27 degrees C) for 112 days. Growth rates varied significantly with temperature except at 17 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and growth rates were highest at 21 degrees C (P < 0.001). Maximum growth rate for age-0 least chub, estimated from a 2nd-order polynomial regression, would occur at 22.3 degrees C. These thermal requirements indicate the importance of warm rearing habitats in producing strong year classes and viable populations. However, warm spring margins also enable western mosquitofish, a nonnative competitor and predator of least chub, to thrive in these spring habitats. Broad thermal limits of the least chub suggest that it could persist at cooler temperatures, which would reduce the viability of western mosquitofish populations.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			1527-0904			WOS:000243217500004

The venerid clam Anomalocardia brasiliana is harvested as a fishery resource from the French West Indies to Brazil. Yet, the exploitation of this species is not backed by management or regulations based on scientific knowledge. This can result in reduced (or even depleted) A. brasiliana density and biomass. Here, we examined the population dynamics of A. brasiliana over the course of 1 year at Cidade Beach, a sheltered sandy beach located in south-eastern Brazil. Sampling was done monthly from March 2007 to February 2008. The sampled population was predominantly juvenile. Growth and recruitment were continuous, indicating no major fluctuation in limiting factors, such as temperature, salinity and food. Nevertheless, the abundance and the turnover rate (P/B ratio) of A. brasiliana at Cidade were much smaller than the values observed in other areas of occurrence. The mortality was more intense in young individuals, and the peak of individual production occurred in individuals with a 25 mm shell length, suggesting that individuals smaller than this size should not be exploited.									5	0	0	0	5	1	5			0025-3154	1469-7769		WOS:000358846800013		
J	Lu, Hong-Liang; Xu, Chun-Xia; Zeng, Zhi-Gao; Du, Wei-Guo								Environmental causes of between-population difference in growth rate of a high-altitude lizard								BMC ECOLOGY				18						37	10.1186/s12898-018-0194-8				SEP 24 2018	2018	Background: Ectothermic animals living in cold (high latitude or high elevation) regions are predicted to grow slower due to limited thermal opportunities for activity and food resources than those living in warm regions. However, the Qinghai toad-headed lizards (Phrynocephalus vlangalii) grow faster and reach a larger adult size at a high-elevation site than at a low-elevation site. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic and environmental causes of this between-population difference in growth rate by conducting mark-recapture and common garden experiments on juvenile growth rate, and investigating the thermal environment, lizard body temperature, potential prey availability at the two elevation sites.Results: Compared with low-elevation individuals, high-elevation juvenile lizards had higher growth rates in the field, but grew at similar rates in the laboratory. High-elevation lizards had higher active body temperatures than low-elevation lizards despite similar air temperatures in the period of field investigation. The high-elevation site had relatively more and larger preys than the low-elevation site.Conclusions: Inter-population difference in growth rate of P. vlangalii may primarily result from developmental plasticity in response to the difference in environmental resources, rather than genetic differentiation. The higher growth rate of high-elevation lizards is likely associated with higher potential food availability and higher active body temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2				1472-6785		WOS:000445796100001	30249235	
J	Watanuki, Yutaka; Ito, Motohiro								Climatic effects on breeding seabirds of the northern Japan Sea								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				454				183	196		10.3354/meps09627				2012	2012	Seabirds as marine top predators have been put forth as reliable indicators of ecosystem change. To understand climate-ecosystem change in the northern Japan Sea, we studied the timing of breeding, chick diets, and breeding success of 3 seabird species almost continuously over 26 yr on Teuri Island, 1984 through 2009. Key climate drivers in this region are: (1) westerly winter winds that cool the atmosphere and the ocean and (2) the northward flowing Tsushima Current (TC) that warms the ocean in late spring and summer. Chick diet showed decadal changes in coastal pelagic fish, with a switch from sardine Sardinops melanostictus to anchovy Engraulis japonicus in the late 1980s corresponding to intensification of the TC. There were no long-term trends in the timing of breeding or breeding success of rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata and Japanese cormorant Phalacrocorax filamentosus, but these variables were affected by interannual variation in spring air and sea temperatures, as well as the timing of TC warm water intrusions within the foraging range (similar to 60 km from the colony) of the birds. Effects include: (1) freezing of the breeding grounds by winter winds limiting access to nesting grounds and (2) availability of anchovy and sandlance Ammodytes personatus affecting chick diet, growth, and breeding success. We did not detect relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and the availability of prey species. The timing and success of black-tailed gulls Larus crassirostris, which fed mainly on sandlance, however, could not be explained by these factors. Our study indicates potential links between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index and the flow rate of the TC, and between the Arctic Oscillation index and local wind stress, and suggests that broad-scale atmospheric pressure fields influence local weather, oceanography, and seabirds indirectly through changes in prey availability.									12	0	0	0	13	0	14			0171-8630			WOS:000304605500015		
J	Freire, Luciane Gomes; Lima, Tatiane do Nascimento								Effect of rain on trap building by Myrmeleon brasiliensis in a riparian woodland from the Cerrado biome in Brazil								ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA				167	6			561	565		10.1111/eea.12788				JUN 2019	2019	In areas of the Cerrado biome (Brazilian savanna) with well-defined rainy and dry seasons, changes in climate and landscape affect the abundance and seasonality of insects. Larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon brasiliensis (Navas) (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) are predators that build traps in dry sandy soil to capture prey. Here we determined the effect of rain on trap building by M. brasiliensis larvae in a riparian forest in the Cerrado biome. Differences in population size and developmental stage were found between the rainy and dry seasons. In the laboratory, the effect of rain-soaked soil on trap building was evaluated. Fewer antlion larvae were found in the rainy season. Moreover, a greater abundance of larvae in the final stage of development (third instar) was found in the dry season, whereas more first instars were found in the rainy season. The latter revealed that wet soil affects the trap building of the larvae, as smaller traps were built in the treatment with soaked soil (simulated rain), whereas the larvae in the control treatment (no rain) continued building traps with no change in size. The findings indicate that seasonality in the Cerrado biome exerts a short-term influence on M. brasiliensis larvae (larvae build fewer traps) as well as a long-term influence (association with life cycle).									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000477015000007

Seasonal variability was observed in the relationships between head length and standard length (SL) at 20, 25, and 30 mm SL, which were all positively related to sea temperature. In addition, SL immediately before and immediately after the start of guanine deposition was negatively related to temperature. Moreover, the development of the caudal fin supports was faster in the order August (warmest month), June (intermediate), and January (coldest); the full complement of pectoral fin rays (>= 14 rays) was observed at 26.5 mm SL in August and 32.7 mm SL in June, but was not observed in January. Thus, morphology at length differed among seasons. Furthermore, there was parallel development of external (head length and pectoral fin rays) and internal (degree of guanine deposition and caudal fin supports) characteristics. The energy requirement for development of some characteristics did not result in delayed development of other characteristics. Overall, larvae at the same somatic size would have a higher potential for predator avoidance and prey capture under higher temperatures, although additional factors will influence potential survival.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000394183600011

Egg Development Timing for Riverine Spawning Pygmy Whitefish (Prosopium coulterii)								NORTHWEST SCIENCE				86	2			85	94		10.3955/046.086.0201				MAY 2012	2012	Despite the large numbers of individuals present during riverine broadcast spawning, little is known about the spawning behavior or egg development timing of pygmy whitefish (Prosopium coulterii). We captured pygmy whitefish from spawning schools in the upper Cedar River, Washington State, and live-spawned to collect milt and eggs. Once fertilized, eggs were placed in Whitlock-Vibert incubation boxes in natural river conditions until hatching. Egg development was monitored weekly by counting eggs and alevin present in boxes, examining a previously undisturbed box each week. Pygmy whitefish hatched over a range of 324 to 370 accumulated temperature units (ATUs). The range in hatch times in this population may be a result of multiple selection pressures (e. g., high flow events frequency, predation, food availability) that confer differing advantages to early and late-hatching individuals. Consequently, even though all broadcast spawning occurs within two weeks, hatching and emergence is spread over a broader temporal period so that not all individuals in the cohort are subjected to the same environmental conditions. These results give better understanding of the timing of hatch and emergence in a pygmy whitefish population and contribute to better management of the species in the face of environmental uncertainty resulting from global climate change.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0029-344X	2161-9859		WOS:000304092500001

Model systems, such as amphibian metamorphosis, which can be generalized across many types of environmental change and across many species, are a powerful tool for understanding mechanisms that facilitate persistence in altered and disturbed environments. Amphibian larvae respond to environmental change by varying age at metamorphosis, or size at metamorphosis. Differential selection pressures on age or size at metamorphosis may result in a differential response among taxa to environmental change. Using a meta-analysis, we investigated whether age at metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis, and larval growth rate vary within and among taxonomic families of amphibians in experiments that modified the environmental temperature, density of individuals, food, hydroperiod and the presence of predators. For all environmental factors except predators, the direction of the response was consistent across most of the studied taxa. However, there was considerable variation in effect size both within and among families. Results demonstrate that amphibian metamorphosis is a valuable model system for studying the effects of environmental change. Yet, we stress the need for caution in making generalizations about how individuals respond to environmental factors that have an indirect effect on physiology and require the perception of an environmental cue, such as the presence of predators.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000389308400002

We analysed > 5000 data points extracted from 270 papers published between 1979 and 2009. We examined the changes in 19 animal response variables to the main effect of elevated CO2. We found strong evidence for significant variation among arthropod orders and feeding guilds, including interactions in the direction of response. We also examined the main effects of elevated CO2 on: six plant growth and allocation responses, seven primary metabolite responses, eight secondary metabolite responses, and four physical defence responses. We examined these response variable changes under two-way and three-way interactions between CO2 and: soil nitrogen, ambient temperature, drought, light availability, photosynthetic pathway, reproductive system, plant growth rate, plant growth form, tissue type, and nitrogen fixation. In general we found smaller effect sizes for many response variables than have been previously reported. We also found that many of the oft-reported main effects of CO2 obscure the presence of significant two-and three-way interactions, which may help better explain the relationships between the response variables and elevated CO2.									197	11	0	0	192	1	206			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000302618300006	22380757	
J	Lyons, J								Influence of winter starvation on the distribution of smallmouth bass among Wisconsin streams: A bioenergetics modeling assessment								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				126	1			157	162		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0157:IOWSOT>2.3.CO;2				JAN 1997	1997	I used a bioenergetics model to test whether overwinter starvation of age-0 smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, a representative warmwater species, could account for their scarcity in coldwater streams of Wisconsin. I modeled 84 combinations of food consumption rate, maximum daily mean summer temperature, and winter duration that encompassed the range of conditions likely to be encountered in Wisconsin streams, and ran simulations for the specific thermal regimes in four coldwater, one coolwater, and two warmwater Wisconsin streams where smallmouth bass population status was known. The model predicted that starvation mortality was unlikely at the highest food consumption rates, the warmest summer temperatures, and the shortest winters. Mortality increased with decreasing food consumption rates, decreasing maximum summer temperatures, and increasing winter duration. Starvation mortality was predicted to be negligible in the two Wisconsin warmwater streams, which had self-sustaining smallmouth bass populations, and to be generally minor in the coolwater and three of the four coldwater streams, all of which lacked smallmouth bass. Only in the coldwater stream with the lowest maximum summer temperature and longest winter, a stream that also lacked smallmouth bass, was mean starvation mortality predicted to consistently exceed 30%. I conclude that, by itself, overwinter starvation of age-0 smallmouth bass is unlikely to limit the occurrence of smallmouth bass in most Wisconsin's coldwater streams. The model also predicted relatively slow growth of age-0 smallmouth bass in Wisconsin coldwater streams. Reduced growth could make age-0 smallmouth bass susceptible to other sources of mortality (e.g., predation, displacement) and might contribute to their scarcity in coldwater streams.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0002-8487			WOS:A1997WK86900014

Bass were collected with boat electrofishing equipment in the south end of Lake Washington (February-June) and the Lake Washington Ship Canal (LWSC; April-July), a narrow waterway that smolts must migrate through to reach the marine environment. Genetic analysis was used to identify ingested salmonids to obtain a more precise species-specific consumption estimate. Overall, we examined the stomachs of 783 smallmouth bass and 310 largemouth bass greater than 100 mm fork length (FL). Rates of predation on salmonids in the south end of Lake Washington were generally low for both black bass species. In the LWSC, juvenile salmonids made up a substantial part of bass diets; consumption of salmonids was lower for largemouth bass than for smallmouth bass. Smallmouth bass predation on juvenile salmonids was greatest in June, when salmonids made up approximately 50% of their diet. In the LWSC, overall black bass consumption of salmonids was approximately 36,000 (bioenergetics model) to 46,000 (meal turnover consumption model) juveniles, of which about one-third was juvenile Chinook salmon, one-third was coho salmon O. kisutch, and one-third was sockeye salmon O. nerka. We estimated that about 2,460,000 juvenile Chinook salmon (hatchery and wild sources combined) were produced in the Lake Washington basin in 1999; thus, the mortality estimates in the LWSC range from 0.5% (bioenergetics) to 0.6% (meal tumover). Black bass prey mostly on subyearlings of each salmonid species. The vulnerability of subyearlings to predation can be attributed to their relatively small size; their tendency to migrate when water temperatures exceed 15 degrees C, coinciding with greater black bass activity; and their use of nearshore areas, where overlap with black bass is greatest. We conclude that under current conditions, predation by smallmouth bass and largemouth bass has a minor impact on Chinook salmon and other salmonid populations in the Lake Washington system.									17	0	0	0	18	0	18			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000252065400012

Stable isotope data are widely used to track the origins and transformations of materials in food webs. Reliable interpretation of these data requires knowledge of the factors influencing isotopic fractionation between diet and consumer. For practical reasons, isotopic fractionation is often assumed to be constant but, in reality, a range of factors may affect fractionation.2. To investigate effects of temperature and feeding rate on fractionation of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in a marine predator, we reared European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax on identical diets at 11 and 16 degrees C on three ration levels for 600 days.3. Nitrogen trophic fractionation (Delta delta N-15) was affected by temperature. Bass Delta delta N-15 was 4.41 parts per thousand at 11 degrees C and 3.78 parts per thousand at 16 degrees C.4. Carbon fractionation (Delta delta C-13) was also affected by temperature. Bass Delta delta C-13 was 1.18 parts per thousand at 11 degrees C and 1.64 parts per thousand at 16 degrees C. The higher lipid content in the tissues of bass reared at cooler temperatures accounted for the temperature effect on Delta delta C-13. When Delta delta C-13 was determined using mathematically defatted values, there was a direct effect of ration size and Delta delta C-13 was 2.51, 2.39 and 2.31 parts per thousand for high, medium and low rations, respectively.5. Reported Delta delta N-15 for all treatments exceeded the mean of 3.4 parts per thousand widely used in ecological studies of fish populations and communities. This would confound the interpretation of delta N-15 as an indicator of trophic level when comparing populations that are exposed to different temperatures.6. The Delta delta C-13 of 0-1 parts per thousand commonly applied in food web studies did not hold under any of the temperature or feeding regimes considered and a value of 2 parts per thousand would be more appropriate.									124	1	0	0	111	0	125			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000244943000020

Motility parameters from >8000 swimming tracks of individual cells were quantified using 3D digital video analysis over a 6-h period in 3 pH treatments reflecting marine carbonate chemistry during the pre-industrial era, currently, and the year 2100. Movement behaviors were investigated in two different acclimation-to-target-pH conditions: instantaneous exposure and acclimation of cells for at least 11 generations. There was no negative impairment of cell motility when exposed to elevated PCO2 (i.e., low pH) conditions but there were significant behavioral responses. Irrespective of acclimation condition, lower pH significantly increased downward velocity and frequency of downward swimming cells (p < 0.001). Rapid exposure to lower pH resulted in 9% faster downward vertical velocity and up to 19% more cells swimming downwards (p < 0.001). Compared to pH-shock experiments, pre-acclimation of cells to target pH resulted in similar to 30% faster swimming speed and up to 46% faster downward velocities (all p < 0.001). The effect of year 2100 PCO2 levels on population diffusivity in pre-acclimated cultures was >2-fold greater than in pH-shock treatments (2.2 x 10(5) mu m(2) s(-1) vs. 8.4 x 10(4) mu m(2) s(-1)). Predictions from an advection-diffusion model, suggest that as PCO2 increased the fraction of the population aggregated at the surface declined, and moved deeper in the water column. Enhanced downward swimming of H. akashiwo at low pH suggests that these behavioral responses to elevated PCO2 could reduce the likelihood of dense surface slick formation of H. akashiwo through reductions in light exposure or growth independent surface aggregations. We hypothesize that the HAB alga's response to higher PCO2 may exploit the signaling function of high PCO2 as indicative of net heterotrophy in the system, thus indicative of high predation rates or depletion of nutrients.

Due to ongoing warming of the sub-Arctic, there is potential for a mismatch between the peak in available invertebrate biomass and the peak in food demand for shorebird chicks. During the summers of 2010 and 2011, we investigated the relationship between temperature and benthic and terrestrial invertebrate biomass, measured using three sampling techniques in Churchill, Manitoba. We also investigated the relationship between timing of breeding of Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) and timing of peaks in invertebrate biomass. In 2011, chick growth rates were also measured to examine whether hatching in synchrony with the peak in invertebrate biomass during the brood rearing period affected growth rates. In 2010, emergent and core invertebrate biomass were negatively related to soil degree days, whereas in 2011, core biomass increased with soil degree days and pitfall biomass increased with air temperature. Total invertebrate biomass (summed over trap types) peaked from 25 to 31days before the median chick hatch date in 2010 and 10days after the median chick hatch date in 2011. In 2011 we did not detect any effects of asynchrony on the growth of Semipalmated Plover chicks. These results may indicate that food resources in their environment remain adequate throughout the breeding season, despite inter-annual fluctuations in the timing of invertebrate peaks.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000459821700015

As physical performance often affects the outcome of predator-prey interactions, environmental temperature can influence the ability of ectotherms to capture prey and/or defend themselves against predators. However, previous research on the kinematics of ectotherms suggests that some species may use elastic storage mechanisms when attacking or defending, thereby mitigating the effects of sub-optimal temperature. Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) are a speciose group of ectothermic viperid snakes that rely on crypsis, rattling and striking to deter predators. We examined the influence of body temperature on the behavior and kinematics of two rattlesnake species (Crotalus oreganus helleri and Crotalus scutulatus) when defensively striking towards a threatening stimulus. We recorded defensive strikes at body temperatures ranging from 15-35 degrees C. We found that strike speed and speed of mouth gaping during the strike were positively correlated with temperature. We also found a marginal effect of temperature on the probability of striking, latency to strike and strike outcome. Overall, warmer snakes are more likely to strike, strike faster, open their mouth faster and reach maximum gape earlier than colder snakes. However, the effects of temperature were less than would be expected for purely muscle-driven movements. Our results suggest that, although rattlesnakes are at a greater risk of predation at colder body temperatures, their decrease in strike performance may be mitigated to some extent by employing mechanisms in addition to skeletal muscle contraction (e.g. elastic energy storage) to power strikes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000576693500013	32561628

We compared life histories of two temperate livebearing fishes Gambusia affinis and G. nobilis, an endangered species which is virtually unstudied. The two species persist in environments that differ widely in abiotic and biotic factors in the same local area. Gambusia affinis were typically found in habitats with high productivity and wide fluctuations in temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen, whereas G. nobilis occurred in more stable spring-fed habitats. We collected data on life-history traits: embryo mass, brood size (number of embryos), total maternal reproductive effort, population sex ratios, and size (mass and length) distributions of adults and juveniles. There was no difference between species in reproductive effort per brood, but they differed in investment strategy. Gambusia affinis females produced large broods with small embryos, whereas G. nobilis females produced broods of fewer, larger embryos. These differences in life history strategies reflect a tradeoff between individual productivity and differential mortality rates in different environments. At our field site G. affinis persists as an annual species with relatively high growth rates and corresponding reproductive patterns, whereas G. nobilis females have a slower reproductive tempo and may live multiple years.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0378-1909	1573-5133		WOS:000306174000009

The volcano barnacle Tetraclita rubescens has recently expanded its range >300 km northward along the coast of California, USA. In the historic portion of its range, Tetraclita is preyed upon by a southern dogwhelk, Nucella emarginata. In newly colonized nor-them habitats, Tetraclita has joined an assemblage of mid-intertidal barnacles preyed upon by two species of northern do-whelks (N. ostrina and N. canaliculata). Using a combination of field enclosures and laboratory experiments, we tested the impacts of northern whelks on volcano barnacles relative to other barnacle species. In the field, juvenile Tetraclita were rarely consumed. In laboratory trials with larger barnacles, Tetraclita were nearly immune to drilling by northern whelks, perhaps due to superior morphological defenses. In all experiments, prior encounters with Tetraclita did not appear to increase the frequency of predation on this barnacle; northern whelk species rarely preyed on Tetraclita even when collected from a site where this barnacle was abundant. In contrast, the southern whelk N. emarginata readily preyed on Tetraclita in laboratory trials, perhaps reflecting a longer shared evolutionary history between these species. Overall, our results suggest that the success of a population established beyond a species' historical range boundary may be influenced by the functional traits of that species in relation to the composition and evolutionary history of the surrounding community.

Approximately 96% of the mosquito eggs placed on damp or dry filter paper and exposed to S. invicta colonies in the laboratory were removed, displaced, or punctured by ant workers within 24 h. Mortality rates for mosquito egg populations manually placed on moist or dry soil and exposed to laboratory colonies of S. invicta for 24 h were 95.9 and 100%, respectively. Mortality rates for mosquito egg populations deposited by Ps. columbiae females on moist or dry soil samples and subsequently exposed to laboratory S. invicta colonies for 18 h dropped to 56.8 and 6 1.0%, respectively. Optimum temperatures for S. invicta predation on mosquito eggs in the laboratory were between 30 and 35-degrees-C, with the ant workers preying equally as well on unembryonated and embryonated mosquito eggs. Field trials verified laboratory findings, with ant predation on mosquito eggs placed in a simulated rice field site infested by S. invicta being most intense during the warmer summer months and when soil surface temperatures were ca. 30-degrees-C. Field results also indicate that S. invicta workers will not prey on desiccated mosquito eggs.									13	1	0	0	11	0	13			8756-971X			WOS:A1994NT47300003

The present study explores the life history of Nymphon hirtipes collected in northeastern Newfoundland between 700 and 1450 m depth and monitored in mesocosms for over 2 years. The pycnogonids were found in association with octocorals, hydrozoans and sea anemones. Adult females developed mature oocytes between June and August. Paired mating followed by oviposition occurred between early July and mid-October. Up to three egg masses were brooded by each male. It took a maximum of 4 months for the propagules to hatch from the egg mass. Offspring developed from walking leg-bearing larvae to early juveniles over the next similar to 5 months before leaving the male's protection. Mating and oviposition coincided with the highest water temperatures of the annual cycle and dispersal of juveniles occurred in spring, when phytodetritus deposition was high and as ocean temperature rose markedly. All the females died after oviposition and the males similar to 9 months later, after juvenile dispersal. The sex ratio of mature individuals (similar to 55-60 mm leg span) was 2 males for 3 females. Fecundity was estimated to be 184-288 eggs per adult female. Adults of N. hirtipes were seen feeding on hydrozoan polyps, small sea anemones (Stephanauge nexilis) and nudibranchs. Larvae and early juveniles did not feed while brooded by the male. Upon dispersal, their feeding apparatus became functional and they began feeding on hydrozoan polyps. After 13 months of growth post hatching, the juveniles reached similar to 21 mm leg span. Curve fitting estimated that similar to 7 years are required to reach the adult size of 55 mm leg span.

We marked a total of 821 adult frogs over 6 years and recaptured 74 at least once between years. Between-year adult survival was sex-specific and varied between 0.06 and 0.53 for males and 0.07-0.41 for females. Adult survival was significantly associated with annual rainfall and is cause for concern if rainfall declines further in the study region as predicted by changes in the global climate. There was a significant interaction between rainfall and sex with dry weather having a stronger negative effect on males than females. Pig-nosed frogs experienced boom and bust years with a single decline more dramatic than increases. Recruitment (in situ and immigration; 0.67-0.88) was substantially more important than adult survival (0.12-0.33) in determining realised population growth. In situ recruitment was highly variable between years with 1-36% of eggs and tadpoles released by females into the pond surviving to metamorphosis. Years of low tadpole survival were associated with high numbers of predatory tortoises. Thus, like other pond-breeding anurans, pig-nosed frogs showed highly variable juvenile recruitment, low adult survival and density-independent effects on population growth by predators and weather.									29	0	0	0	31	0	32			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000223560000005	15300484

Mismatches can constrain individuals to complete life-cycle steps in time and in ephemeral habitats it can lead to mortality unless compensation mechanisms exist. Here we measured the performance of a population of European fire-salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) and their prey in ephemeral ponds. We analysed how short time inter-annual variability of yearly rainfall and temperature (two consecutive years, 2011 and 2012) affects matching of predator and prey and how two different weather scenarios influenced the predator's population structure. A single species (larvae of the mosquito Aedes vexans) dominates the prey community here, which occurs in high quantities only in the beginning of the season. When the occurrence of prey and predator matched during a period of sufficiently high temperatures (as in 2011), initial growth of the salamander larvae was high and population size development homogeneous. At low temperatures during matching of predatory and prey (as in 2012), the initial growth was low but the salamander larvae developed into two distinctly different sizes. Further, some individuals in the large cohort became cannibalistic and initial size differences increased. As a result, the latest (smallest) cohort disappeared completely. Temperature measurements and estimation of maximal growth rates revealed that temperature differences alone could explain the different early development between years. Our data show that weather conditions (rainfall; temperature during early growth phase) strongly determined the performance of salamander larvae in ponds. Our data also add to the match-mismatch concept that abiotic growth conditions (here: low temperature) could prevent efficient conversion of prey-into predator-biomass despite high prey availability.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0173-5373	1568-5381		WOS:000357721600001

MODEL DESCRIPTION AND BASE-LINE SIMULATIONS								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				122	3			415	438		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0415:IBMOYO>2.3.CO;2				MAY 1993	1993	An individual-based model of population dynamics of age-0 striped bass Morone saxatilis is described and model predictions are analyzed. The model begins with spawning and simulates the daily growth and mortality of the progeny from each egg clutch as the fish develop through the life stages of egg, yolk-sac larva, feeding larva, and juvenile during their first year of life in a single, well-mixed compartment. Day of spawning and development rates of eggs and yolk-sac larvae depend on temperature. Daily growth of feeding individuals is represented by a bioenergetics equation, for which consumption is based on random encounters by individuals with different types of prey. Larvae feed on four zooplankton types and juveniles feed exclusively on size-classes of four benthic types. Mortality of eggs and yolk-sac larvae has both temperature-dependent and constant terms; mortality of feeding larvae and juveniles depends on an individual's weight and length. Most of the computations in the simulation involve determining the daily number of each prey type eaten by each striped bass. Model predictions of larval and juvenile densities, growth rates, and mortality rates were similar to values observed in the Potomac River. Larger mothers produce more and larger eggs, which lead to larger larvae at first feeding. Increasing first-feeding size from 5.0 to 5.5 mm caused a 4.5-fold increase in survival to age 1. Average growth rates during the first 15 d of feeding for larvae that would survive to age 1 were about 0.1 mm/d higher than the average of all larvae. Juveniles in the model appeared to die at random because both the rate and the degree of size-selective mortality decreased rapidly during the juvenile stage. The model represents feeding in detail: additional model refinements and analyses should focus on incorporating behavioral and phenotypic differences among individuals, spatial and temporal variability in temperature and prey, and further model corroboration.									64	2	0	0	59	0	67			0002-8487			WOS:A1993LR87600013

Even though, many studies have been carried out to establish its culture, there has not been established which and how environmental factors influence its growth under culture condition. Spats with a mean size of 30 mm were suspended in “Spanish baskets” at a depth of 4 m during 6 months. The experiment was carried on at La Restinga lagoon, Margarita Island, Venezuela. Each month oysters were measured (ventral-dorsal and antero-posterior), and weighted (dry weight from conch,tissue and fouling). Survivorship was also evaluated. Water temperature was recorded continuously and weekly measurements of Secchi depth, salinity, oxygen, total, organic and inorganic seston, and chlorophyll a were determined. Results show 89% increase in ventral-dorsal size reaching sizes of 54.5 mm. Dry weight of tissue at the end of the study period was 0.48 g after a decrease during the warmer months of august and september, indicating temperature as an important factor controlling spawning. The high and constant phytoplanktonic biomass present in La Restinga lagoon showed that food availability was not a limiting factor, which together with the small variability in the studied environmental variables, made impossible to identify factors controlling growth and survival of Crassostrea rhizophorae in long-line suspended culture. The exception was the occasional predation by Cymatium snails.	La ostra de mangle, Crassostrea rhizophorae, es uno de los moluscos con mayores perspectivas para el desarrollo de la acuicultura en el Caribe y costa atlántica tropical. Aunque se han realizado estudios para establecer su cultivo, no se ha determinado la influencia de los factores ambientales en el desarrollo bajo condiciones de cultivo. Individuos de 30 mm fueron cultivados en cestas españolas a 4 m de profundidad en la laguna de La Restinga, Isla de Margarita, Venezuela. Mensualmente se determinaron la longitud y masa de la concha, así como la masa del tejido blando y los organismos y material depositado sobre las valvas (fouling), además de la supervivencia. La temperatura se registró continuamente y semanalmente se observó la transparencia del agua y se determinaron la salinidad, oxígeno, seston (total, orgánico e inorgánico) y la biomasa fitoplanctónica. La longitud dorso-ventral incrementó 89%, alcanzando tallas de 54,5 mm y 0,48 g de tejido seco, luego de recuperarse de una disminución en los meses de agosto a septiembre (meses cálidos), sugiriendo a la temperatura como un factor importante en el desove. La elevada y constante biomasa fitoplanctónica en el sistema de manglar mostró que la disponibilidad de alimento no fue limitante, lo que en conjunto con la poca variabilidad en los factores ambientales estudiados no permitieron una clara identificación de factores que afectan la varianza observada en la masa de los tejidos blandos y la sobrevivencia de C. rhizophorae en condiciones de cultivo suspendido, con la excepción de la incidencia eventual de gasterópodos depredadores del género Cymatium.								4	0	0	0	4	6	8			0798-7269			SCIELO:S0798-72692009000100010

We posited that biotic interactions, particularly predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory assumed a primary top-down role in affecting small mammals and annual plants here. Using a multi factorial design we selectively excluded vertebrate predators (principally carnivores and raptors) and a large small mammal herbivore, the degu (Octodon degus), from replicated 0.56 ha exclosures located in a valley near the coast in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park. Evidence initially supported effects of predator exclusion on O. degus but not for other small mammals in the assemblage (e.g., Phyllotis darwini, Abrothrix olivaceus). Subsequent years of monitoring have documented that predation has temporary effects on degu numbers, but that populations of this and other small mammals are much more strongly influenced by environmental bottom-up factors (i.e., rainfall). Further, our experimental manipulation has provided no evidence for negative interspecific competition effects on numbers of any small mammal in this assemblage. Degu exclusions, however, have had negative indirect effects on exotic annuals; native annuals appear to outcompete exotics especially during drought years The effect is magnified in all-small mammal exclusions. Since about 2002, selective exclusions of lagomorphs and small mammals have resulted in changes in cover of some perennial shrubs. Also notable has been a fundamental shift in the small mammal composition following the last major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in 2000 2002; degus now comprise a majority of small mammal biomass in the assemblage, and their numbers have become more stable and less temporally variable. This appears to have been caused by a shift in rainfall periodicity from strong interannual fluctuations in response to periodic ENSOs, to a more equitable pattern with more consistent annual rainfall. This represents one of the first documented cases of system-wide biotic phase shifts to a relatively modest change in rainfall regime. This may be indicative of ongoing climate change in the Chilean semiarid region, and we expect that further changes in the community will occur if those trends continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, animals may decline in abundance where their reproductive success is low, and these poor-quality locations differ among species. Yet habitat use does not always appear adaptive. The crucial tests of how abundances and demographic costs of animals vary along experimentally manipulated vegetation gradients are lacking. We examined habitat use and nest predation rates for 16 bird species that exhibited turnover with shifts in deciduous and coniferous vegetation. For most bird species, decreasing abundance was associated with increasing predation rates along both natural and experimentally modified vegetation gradients. This landscape-scale approach strongly supports the idea that vegetation-mediated effects of predation are associated with animal distributions and species turnover.									15	1	0	0	16	0	17			0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000356021700022

Because higher trophic levels are expected to suffer most strongly from intensification, negative consequences for ecosystem services, such as biological pest control by natural enemies, are likely. In European beech forests ambrosia beetles are common secondary pests of freshly cut wood and stored timber, but they may also infest living trees that are highly stressed.We examined whether forest management intensity, ranging from unmanaged beech forests to non-natural conifer plantations, affects the abundance, attack rate, and breeding success of ambrosia beetles across three regions of Germany. We applied pheromone trapping to estimate the abundance of ambrosia beetles and exposed experimental beech logs to measure infestation rates and breeding success.In general, we found decreasing abundance and attack probability by ambrosia beetles with increasing management intensity, which is most likely related to the availability of suitable breeding substrate. However, the abundance of the invasive species Xylosandrus germanus increased with increasing management intensity in one region, where high management intensity was represented by pine forests; the drier and warmer conditions in this forest type most likely increased population densities. Breeding success of Trypodendron domesticum increased with increasing management intensity, suggesting less effective pest control by natural antagonists, in particular by specialised parasitoids, at high management intensities.We conclude that the availability of breeding substrate, in combination with microclimate and antagonist effectiveness, shape ambrosia beetle populations in Central European forests. Forest management strategies should thus reduce the availability of breeding substrate in production forests, in particular where microclimatic conditions are favourable for beetle reproduction (i.e. warm, moist). Moreover, unmanaged forest patches should be maintained to promote parasitoid abundance and thus to mitigate negative effects of climate change, such as increasing drought stress of trees.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1127	1872-7042		WOS:000461270600012

In the present study, we assessed the impact of food availability and climate on the shag population by analysing 25 years of data (1985 to 2009) on breeding numbers in 3 large colonies: 2 in the Norwegian Sea (65 degrees N and 67 degrees N) and 1 in the Barents Sea (70 degrees N). Predictor variables were ICES abundance estimates of young saithe Pollacius virens, the most important forage fish for shags in the Norwegian Sea, and for the Barents Sea colony also total stock size estimates of Barents Sea capelin Mallotus villosus. As proxies for climate variation, we used the North Atlantic Oscilliation index (NAO) for the last and the preceding winter (lagged by 1 yr). Finally, the annual population size of the study colonies in the preceding year was included in the models to control for potential density-dependent effects. The predictor variables explained 46 to 67% of the variation in annual growth rate in the colonies. In the Barents Sea colony, the shag population growth rate was only associated with capelin abundance, whereas for the Norwegian Sea colonies, there were strong positive relationships with 1 yr old saithe and a negative effect of the lagged NAO winter index. The latter effect may be a result of unfavourable weather conditions with high winds and precipitation in winter increasing mortality among non-breeding age classes of shag. Our study is the first to demonstrate a close correlation between stock estimates of the primary forage fish for European shags and shag breeding numbers. This suggests that the population growth rate and diet of shags may be used as cost-efficient and reliable indicators of major shifts in saithe stock recruitment.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000323941000018

We found that a general linear model developed using yellow perch data from western Lake Erie performed best followed closely by a semimechanistic individual-based model (IBM) specific to Lake Erie yellow perch and worse by a general multispecies IBM. We suspect that the statistical model performed better because, unlike IBMs, it does not require prey availability data, probably poorly represented by zooplankton samples, and because the IBMs are imperfectly parameterized. Our findings indicate that caution should be exercised when using general IBMs given that the models parameterized with observations from the system of interest outperformed the general IBM in providing accurate fish growth and length estimates, pointing to the need for research that can improve existing mechanism-based models of larval growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000419137900008		
J	Taylor, David L.; Nichols, Ryan S.; Able, Kenneth W.								Habitat selection and quality for multiple cohorts of young-of-the-year bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix): Comparisons between estuarine and ocean beaches in southern New Jersey								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				73	3-4			667	679		10.1016/j.ecss.2007.03.007				JUL 2007	2007	In this study, seasonal and annual variability in the use of estuarine and ocean beaches by young-of-the-year bluefish, Pomatonlus saltatrix, was evaluated by indices of abundance in coastal areas of southern New Jersey (1998-2000). Biological and physical factors measured at specific sites were correlated with bluefish abundance to determine the mechanisms underlying habitat selection. In addition, integrative and discrete indicators of bluefish growth were used to examine spatio-temporal dynamics in habitat quality and its effect on habitat selection by multiple cohorts of bluefish. Intra-annual recruitment to coastal areas of southern New Jersey was episodic, and resulted from the ingress of spring-spawned bluefish (hatch-date similar to April) to estuarine beaches in late May to early June, followed by the recruitment of summer-spawned fish (hatch-date similar to early July) to ocean beaches from July to October. Bluefish utilized estuarine and ocean beaches in a facultative manner that was responsive to dynamics in prey composition and temperature conditions. The recruitment and residency of bluefish in the estuary (19981999) and ocean beaches (1998), for example, was coincidental with the presence of the Atlantic silverside Menidia nienidia and bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, the principal prey species for bluefish occupying these respective habitat-types. Bluefish abundance in the estuary (2000) and ocean beaches (1999-2000) was also correlated with water temperature, with the greatest catches of juveniles coinciding with their optimal growth temperature (24 degrees C). Bluefish growth, estimated as the slope of age-length relationships and daily specific growth rates, equaled 1.27-2.63 mm fork length (FL) d- 1 and 3.8-8.7% body length increase d- 1, respectively. The growth of sagittal otoliths was also used as a proxy for changes in bluefish size during and shortly before their time of capture. Accordingly, otolith growth rates of summer-spawned bluefish were greater at ocean beaches relative to the estuary and were explained by the more suitable temperature conditions found at ocean beaches during the mid- to late summer. Notwithstanding the fast growth of oceanic summer-spawned bluefish, individuals spawned in the spring were still larger in absolute body size at the end of the summer growing season (similar to 240 and 50-200 mm FL for spring- and summer-spawned bluefish, respectively). The size discrepancy between spring- and summer-spawned bluefish at the onset of autumn migrations and during overwintering periods may account for the differential recruitment success of the respective cohorts.

J	Supina, Jan; Bojkova, Jindriska; Boukal, David S.					Bojkova, Jindriska/0000-0003-0996-3308			Warming erodes individual-level variability in life history responses to predation risk in larvae of the mayflyCloeon dipterum								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				65	12			2211	2223		10.1111/fwb.13619		SEP 2020		DEC 2020	2020	Warming and predation risk are ubiquitous environmental factors that can modify life histories and population dynamics of aquatic ectotherms. While separate responses to each of these factors are well understood, their joint effects on individual life histories and population dynamics remain largely unexplored. Current theory predicts that the magnitude of prey behavioural, physiological, and life history responses to predation risk should diminish with warming due to the reduced metabolic scope. However, empirical support for this prediction remains equivocal, and experiments covering a substantial proportion of individual prey ontogeny until maturation are lacking. To fill these gaps, we ran a laboratory experiment to investigate how warming and non-consumptive predation risk influence life history responses in the larvae of the mayflyCloeon dipterum, an aquatic insect with highly plastic development. We reared larvae of varying initial sizes at three temperatures (21, 24, and 27 degrees C) in a risk-free environment and under predation risk signalled by chemical cues from dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea), and followed their individual survival, growth, and development until emergence. SomeC. dipterumlarvae substantially prolonged their development and the proportion of theseslowindividuals declined rapidly with temperature and increased with predation risk. We attribute this response to cohort splitting, a common life history strategy of aquatic insects and other taxa in unpredictable environment. Growth, development, and maturation varied predictably with temperature in thefastlarvae that did not prolong their development. They grew and developed faster but matured at smaller sizes with increasing temperature. Predation risk tended to slow down individual growth and development in line with the reduced metabolic scope hypothesis, but the differences were relatively minor and observable only at 21 degrees C. Survival to subimago increased with predation risk, possibly due to indirect effects mediated by dissolved micronutrients, but did not vary significantly with temperature. Survival also tended to be higher in theslowindividuals. This partly compensated for a smaller final size relative to thefastindividuals and made both strategies comparable in overall fitness. Our results show that warming may erode individual-level variability in life history responses to predation risk. This implies that warming can synchronise population dynamics and consequently make such populations more vulnerable to unpredictable disturbances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000569341800001

MARINE BIOLOGY				130	4			663	674		10.1007/s002270050288				MAR 1998	1998	Using a long-term data set of Gardineroseris planulata (Dana) on Uva Island reef, Panama, we developed a simulation model that relates size-specific schedules of growth and partial mortality to predation by Acanthaster planci (Linnaeus) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related elevation of water temperature. We compared the model predictions to field observations for both the subpopulation of colonies that was used for model development and for the entire population. No statistically significant differences in the size-frequency distributions of the real and modeled coral populations were found for the subpopulation during any of 9 yr or for the entire population during 4 yr. These results suggested that the model relationships were reflecting field conditions. Longer-term (100 yr) simulations were conducted to assess the relative importance of predation and ENSO-related colony losses in determining the size structure of the coral population. Predation by A. planci was of overwhelming importance due to both stronger effects of predation (larger transitions) and the frequency of predation (yearly) compared to ENSO (episodically). Even the least-frequent predation scenario skewed the distribution toward smaller colonies, while simulations where populations were subjected to frequent ENSO events (greater than or equal to 3 yr) still maintained colonies in the largest size class. The model results suggested that sea star predators may not have been in the present abundance on this reef prior to the last 30 yr; with predators present, the model predicts that the distribution would be skewed toward smaller colonies.									47	0	0	0	47	3	50			0025-3162			WOS:000073026500012		
J	Elliott, JK; Leggett, WC				Leggett, William C/F-6009-2011				The effect of temperature on predation rates of a fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and a jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) on larval capelin (Mallotus villosus)								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				53	6			1393	1402		10.1139/f96-049				JUN 1996	1996	Field studies have shown that temperature influences larval fish mortality rates. In laboratory experiments conducted in microcosms (38 L) and mesocosms (3100 L), we tested the effect of three temperatures (3, 9, and 15 degrees C) on the mortality rates of newly emerged larval capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the presence and absence of predators: the stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the jellyfish Aurelia aurita. Predation rates by sticklebacks were positively correlated with temperature in microcosm trials, but not in mesocosm trials; this difference was related to the duration of the experiments and the level of satiation of the sticklebacks. Predation rates by jellyfish were significantly lower at 3 degrees C than at 9 and 15 degrees C in microcosm trials, and significantly more larvae were found dead, though not consumed, at 3 degrees C. As a result, there was no difference in the total mortality rate of capelin among temperatures in microcosm trials with jellyfish. Mesocosm trials with jellyfish also resulted in no significant differences in larval mortality rates among temperatures. In the field, mass emergence of capelin larvae probably swamps small fish predators such as sticklebacks that have high capture rates and small gut capacities, but not jellyfish, which have relatively low capture rates and large gut volumes.									34	3	0	0	31	0	37			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:A1996VP79900016

Hopcroft, Russell R/I-6286-2012				Growth and development of Pseudocalanus spp. in the northern Gulf of Alaska								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				30	8			923	935		10.1093/plankt/fbn046				AUG 2008	2008	Pseudocalanus are the numerically dominant calanoid species in coastal subarctic Pacific waters. We examined their juvenile growth rates, and explored their relationships to temperature, chlorophyll a and body size for Pseudocalanus spp. from 2002 to 2004 in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Generally, the monthly mean growth rates increased from 0.049 +/- 0.007(SE) day(-1) in March to 0.095 +/- 0.016 day(-1) in August, declining slightly to 0.074 +/- 0.009 day(-1) in October. Typically, growth rates at most stations were around 0.05 day(-1), with no consistent or significant pattern between stations. After standardization to 5 and 10 degrees C, the mean growth rates were 0.045 +/- 0.002 day(-1) and 0.075 +/- 0.004 day(-1) respectively, with growth rate decreasing with increasing development stage. Unlike other local calanoid copepod species, Pseudocalanus species tend to be more temperature-dependent than food-dependent, with composite statistical models describing at most 30% of the observed variability in growth rate. Interestingly, development time was comparable to other co-occurring calanoid copepods; however, growth rates of Pseudocalanus spp. were considerably lower. We demonstrate this with a new multi-species model that describes the growth rates of other egg-scattering copepods in this ecosystem, but to which Pseudocalanus does not fit. Thus, the egg-carrying Pseudocalanus species appear to employ a life history strategy optimized for slow growth at low chlorophyll that keeps individuals relatively small, and may therefore reduce visual predation upon them.									23	0	2	0	17	0	25			0142-7873	1464-3774		WOS:000258331300006

In laboratory conditions, we investigated the influence of two commonly used insecticides, spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin, on mortality and functional response of a community of Philodromus spiders (P. cespitum 80 %, P. albidus 20 %) at different temperatures (10, 17, 25, and 31 A degrees C). Almost all spiders died at 31 A degrees C in the lambda-cyhalothrin treatment. Mortality was very low at other temperatures. Mortality in the spinosad treatment did not differ from the control. Both pesticides reduced the prey capture rate and/or changed the type of functional response at all temperatures. The sublethal effects of lambda-cyhalothrin were most pronounced at 10 A degrees C, while those of spinosad were most marked at 10 and 25 A degrees C. At 10 A degrees C, the pesticides' effects on the spiders were long lasting. In addition, lambda-cyhalothrin influenced the philodromids much more negatively than spinosad suggesting its incompatibility with IPM across all temperatures. The results support the importance of studying the temperature-specific effects of pesticides in order to increase the efficiency of integrated pest management. Philodromids are effective in pest suppression at low temperatures, but application of pesticides at the beginning of the season can significantly disrupt their biocontrol potential.									20	1	0	0	18	0	20			1612-4758	1612-4766		WOS:000376923400020

It defines the season and duration of growth and reproduction and paces ecological interactions and ecosystem functions. Phenology models have become a key component of models in agronomy, forestry, ecology, and biogeosciences. Plant and animal process-based phenology models have taken different paths that have so far not crossed. Yet, they share many features because plant and animal annual cycles also share many characteristics, from their stepwise progression, including a resting period, to their dependence on similar environmental factors. We review the strengths and shortcomings of these models and the divergences in modeling approaches for plants and animals, which are mostly due to specificities of the questions they tackle. Finally, we discuss the most promising avenues and the challenges phenology modeling needs to address in the upcoming years.									49	1	0	0	44	0	50			1543-592X		978-0-8243-1448-4	WOS:000415250000008		
J	Forsythe, P. S.; Crossman, J. A.; Firkus, C. P.; Scribner, K. T.; Baker, E. A.								Effects of crayfish density, body size and substrate on consumption of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) eggs by invasive rusty crayfish [(Orconectes rusticus (Girard, 1852)]								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY				34	2	SI		314	321		10.1111/jai.13562				APR 2018	2018	The density and size of benthic predators such as crayfish and the physical characteristics of aquatic habitats including benthic substrate size have been hypothesized to significantly affect levels of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) egg consumption. The invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) was used to quantify consumption and apportion variation in egg loss in an experimental setting. Experiments consisted of large flow-through rectangular tanks (0.8 m wide, 2.96 m(2) total bottom surface area) receiving river water to mimic natural diel temperature regimes. Four crayfish densities were tested (5, 10, 15, 30 individuals or 1.7, 3.4, 5.1, 10.1 individuals/m(2)) that span the range of densities observed in natural settings. Crayfish were allowed to freely move among three substrates commonly found at spawning locations where lake sturgeon eggs are deposited (cobble, gravel and sand). After an acclimation period (15min), 200 lake sturgeon eggs were randomly scattered over each substrate category (600 eggs per tank). Mean (+/- SE) egg consumption over 48hr was 80 +/- 3% (range 19-100% across 16 replicate trials). Egg consumption increased significantly as a function of increasing crayfish density. The effect of substrate size, however, depended significantly on crayfish density (substrate sizexpredator density interaction). Egg consumption significantly increased as substrate size decreased (e.g. from gravel to sand), at both high and low crayfish densities. Egg consumption also increased with increasing mean crayfish body size. Our results revealed that levels of lake sturgeon egg consumption by rusty crayfish are high in some settings. Further work is needed to determine if egg consumption in natural river settings is similarly high and whether egg consumption by crayfish and other egg predators could negatively affect population levels of recruitment.					5th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Sturgeon-and-Paddlefish-Society (NASPS)5th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Sturgeon-and-Paddlefish-Society (NASPS)	SEP 19-22, 2016SEP 19-22, 2016	N Amer Sturgeon & Paddlefish SocN Amer Sturgeon & Paddlefish Soc	Hood River, ORHood River, OR	2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000428797200007		
J	FITZ, HC; WIEGERT, RG				Fitz, Harold/D-9517-2012				UTILIZATION OF THE INTERTIDAL ZONE OF A SALT-MARSH BY THE BLUE-CRAB CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS - DENSITY, RETURN FREQUENCY, AND FEEDING-HABITS								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				76	3			249	260		10.3354/meps076249				OCT 1991	1991	The extent to which the blue crab Callinectes sapidus utilizes resources within the intertidal zone of salt marshes has not been quantified in a rigorous manner. In the salt marshes of Sapelo Island, Georgia (USA), we sampled blue crabs using block nets as the crabs moved out of defined intertidal areas, determining the timing and extent of movement into, and feeding habits within, intertidal habitats. Blue crabs were absent or had an extremely low density within an intertidal marsh impoundment during winter, when water temperature was below ca 15-degrees-C. Juveniles less-than-or-equal-to 80 mm carapace width started moving into the intertidal zone in March or April, but the intertidal density of blue crabs was dominated by larger juveniles and adults (> 80 mm) throughout the summers of the 2.5 yr study (March 1985 to August 1987). Densities were not large, peaking at 40 to 50 crabs ha-1 (of total area sampled) during September. A non-impounded site located in a different local region had similar total densities to those of the impoundment, but had significantly more juveniles less-than-or-equal-to 80 mm. Comparison of the size frequency distributions of blue crabs captured in the non-impounded intertidal area and in a nearby subtidal creek showed that all sizes of crabs (greater-than-or-equal-to 35 mm) moved into the intertidal zone of the marsh during the summer in approximate proportion to their abundance within the source (subtidal) population. On a shorter time scale during May-June, we captured more crabs in the impoundment during daytime vs nocturnal high tides. The extent of tidal inundation did not appear to greatly affect abundance here, although abundance during the lowest of the tidal heights was somewhat less than that during intermediate and high tidal heights. The principal prey consumed by relatively large (mostly > 100 mm) blue crabs within the study zone were natant fishes (38%) and resident non-portunid crabs (43%). Shrimp and similar crustaceans formed 12% of the diet; other invertebrates such as gastropods and annelids a very small portion, Returns of individual blue crabs to the same intertidal marsh zone primarily occurred within 10 d of their initial capture, after which they apparently emigrated from the local area. This study provides the most complete synthesis available of the timing and extent to which blue crabs use the intertidal habitat of the salt marsh.									53	0	0	0	43	1	54			0171-8630			WOS:A1991GM74500004

An alternative method revealed that in New Caledonia, eels are far more abundant and diverse than previously suspected. We analysed the stomach contents of two species of sea snakes that feed on eels (Laticauda laticaudata and L. saintgironsi). This technique is feasible because the snakes return to land to digest their prey, and (since they swallow their prey whole) undigested food items are identifiable. The snakes' diet consisted almost entirely (99.6%) of eels and included 14 species previously unrecorded from the area. Very large populations of snakes occur in the study area (e.g. at least 1,500 individuals on a small coral islet). The snakes capture approximately 36,000 eels (972 kg) per year, suggesting that eels and snakes play key roles in the functioning of this reef ecosystem.									41	1	0	0	38	0	41			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000245125400035

Because the dam drains off surface water the temperature is increased downstream. The accumulated annual temperature above 12 degrees C, the threshold for larval moulting, was 2400 degree-days in the natural stream, but 3300 degree-days downstream of the dam. Although the density of small prey (< 0.8 mm in width) was lower below the dam, large prey density (> 0.8 mm width) which is the important prey category for this size-selective predator did not differ between the two streams. The larval period was 2 years in the natural stream. However, it was reduced to 1 year, and slightly smaller adults emerged, below the dam. Thus, temperature greatly affected the larval growth rate of P. immaculatus, and slightly altered their body size at maturity.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0165-0424			WOS:A1996UL62700003

Juveniles were maintained in enclosures with 100 individuals suspended to long line at 2-3 m from the surface. The oysters were analyzed monthly determining shell dimensions and dry mass of shell, and soft body, and fouling organisms on shells. Temperature was continually recorded with electronic thermographs and food availability (total and organic seston and phytoplanktonic biomass), oxygen concentration and salinity were determinated weekly. The 15-mm increase in shell height and the 70% of survival suggest a low culture feasibility of C. rhizophorae in Golfo de Cariaco (Turpialito locality). Slow growth rates were related to low food availability, mainly phytoplanktonic biomass. Fouling in enclosures and on shells, in addition to predation, principally by Cymatium spp. gastropods, were negative factors for culture. Reproduction could be an endogenous factor that affects somatic growth. Studies of growth and survival in continuing upwelling period (january-june), where food availability is high, as well as studies of fouling and predation influences are necessary to establish strategies for the C. rhizophorae culture in the Golfo de Cariaco.									8	0	0	0	9	8	14			0798-2259			WOS:000220263600005

Nutritionally valuable algae for zooplankton are rich in essential biomolecules such as amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), sterols, and phosphorus. We performed laboratory experiments and showed a stronger positive relationship between zooplankton (Daphnia) cumulative offspring number and availability of high-quality algae (Cryptophytes: Rhodomonas/Cryptomonas; and Chrysophytes: Mallomonas) than with intermediate-quality (Chlorophytes: Acutodesmus) or poor-quality (Dinoflagellates: Peridinium) algae. The higher cumulative offspring number of Daphnia was a result of higher amounts of total omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, proteins, sterols, and amino acids in the algal diets. The experiments also showed that even a small addition of high-quality algae (Rhodomonas) to intermediate-quality (Acutodesmus) or low-quality (bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, or terrestrial organic matter) diets can enhance the Daphnia cumulative offspring production. Our carbon mass balance calculation for a eutrophic clearwater lake and an oligotrophic polyhumic lake showed that the abundance of high-quality phytoplankton (cryptophytes, chrysophytes, diatoms) among total particulate organic carbon was minor (8.7% [SD 2.4%] and 6.5% [7.0%]). We modeled Daphnia diets (i.e., resource assimilation) using a fatty acid mixing model. Our analyses showed that Daphnia were able to locate high-quality algae (cryptophytes, chrysophytes, and diatoms) more effectively during cyanobacteria blooms in a eutrophic lake (55% [SD 12%]) than in a polyhumic lake (25% [10%]).

Theory predicts that such secondary extinctions are driven primarily by loss of species from intermediate or basal trophic levels. In contrast, most cases of secondary extinctions from natural systems have been attributed to loss of entire top trophic levels. Here, we show that loss of single predator species in isolation can, irrespective of their identity or the presence of other predators, trigger rapid secondary extinction cascades in natural communities far exceeding those generally predicted by theory. In contrast, we did not find any secondary extinctions caused by intermediate consumer loss. A food web model of our experimental system-a marine rocky shore community-could reproduce these results only when biologically likely and plausible nontrophic interactions, based on competition for space and predator-avoidance behaviour, were included. These findings call for a reassessment of the scale and nature of extinction cascades, particularly the inclusion of nontrophic interactions, in forecasts of the future of biodiversity.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000404863300003	28346736

To meet the demand for a supply of biologicals, the mass rearing of natural enemies is an option, and the first step must be to develop a standardized system that maximizes the production of prey. One choice for this first step is to use simulation models that can evaluate scenarios that are difficult or complex to address experimentally. In this work, a model was developed to evaluate the current management conditions for the mass rearing of the pest mite Tetranychus urticae Koch. Our aim was to identify alternative scenarios to maximize mite production through mass rearing that could be evaluated in real systems. We assumed that populations of T. urticae were regulated by the conditions of supply-demand theory and modeled the age structure, temperature effects, and individual phenology of T. urticae. The supply-demand theory of resources was used to regulate populations, which involved structured ages and temperature effects for the different stages in the development of individuals. We used the functional response and the paradigm of metabolic pool models to describe resource acquisition and allocation. We demonstrated that 7- to 14-day-old plants infested with 45 or 62 T. urticae/plant could reach 25,000 individuals/plant, being 50% of these preys at the preferred stages by the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot. Our theoretical model requires validation in experimental/real systems of mass rearing to better verify the validity of all of the parameters and predictions before commercial implementation.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1519-566X	1678-8052		WOS:000376480000009	26943232

For higher trophic levels of plankton, these seasonal interactions are less well understood. Here, we study the mid-winter feeding of chaetognaths in high-Arctic fjord ecosystems. Chaetognaths are planktivorous predators which comprise high biomass in high-latitude seas. We investigated the common species Parasagitta elegans around the Svalbard archipelago (78-81A degrees N) during the winters of 2012 and 2013. Our samples consisted of individuals (body lengths 9-55 mm) from three fjords, which were examined for gut contents (n = 903), stable isotopes, fatty acid composition, and maturity status (n = 352). About a quarter of the individuals contained gut contents, mainly lipid droplets and chitinous debris, whilst only 4 % contained identifiable prey, chiefly the copepods Calanus spp. and Metridia longa. The delta N-15 content of P. elegans, and its average trophic level of 2.9, confirmed its carnivorous position and its fatty acid profile [in particular its high levels of 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11)] confirmed carnivory on Calanus. Observations of undeveloped gonads in many of the larger P. elegans, and the absence of small individuals < 10 mm, suggested that reproduction had not started this early in the year. Its average feeding rate across fjords and years was 0.12 prey ind.(-1) day(-1), which is low compared to estimates of spring and summer feeding in high-latitude environments. Our findings suggest reduced feeding activity during winter and that predation by P. elegans had little impact on the mortality of copepods.									17	1	1	0	14	0	19			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000348216800009

A nearly full matrix experimental design with respect to the variables predator weight (< 10-400 g) meal size (up to 7.8% body weight) and temperature ( 10-20 degrees C) was covered with 0-group smelt Osmerus eperlanus as prey. A general evacuation model without meal size as a variable was fitted to the data on wet weights as well as on dry weights by means of non-linear regression technique Two methods of data transformation, relative data and square root transformation, were applied to improve variance homogeneity. The most reliable model fit was achieved on dry weight data applying the square root transformation technique:S-t=[S-0(0.31) - 0.109t W-0.248 e(0.0321)](3.23)where S-t=stomach content (g wet weight) at time t after ingestion. S-0=the initial meal size, W=predator (g wet weight). and T=temperature. The estimated coefficient of the exponential temperature function, delta =0.032, corresponds to a Q(10) value of 1.4 which is outstandingly low in comparison with results on other species. However additional experiments to determine maximum daily food rations indicated that appetite in contrast to gastric evacuation is strongly temperature dependent.

J	Alonzo, SH; Mangel, M								Survival strategies and growth of krill: avoiding predators in space and time								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				209				203	217		10.3354/meps209203				2001	2001	Although Antarctic krill live in a relatively harsh and variable environment, they are extremely abundant and occur across a wide geographic range. Krill are also the dominant prey item for a variety of predators ranging from fish to whales. Thus, krill Life histories and survival strategies represent an interesting and biologically relevant theoretical question: How do krill survive and what makes them so successful? The factors that influence krill size and spatial distributions and life-history patterns are not generally understood. We present a conceptual framework for studying krill life histories and patterns of distribution. This approach uses what is known about krill physiology and environmental conditions within an evolutionary framework to increase our understanding of hill distributions and abundance. Using a dynamic state-variable model, we determined the factors predicted to affect the distribution of krill among habitats and feeding behavior of krill. Habitats vary in their associated survival, predation risk, food availability, and metabolic costs. Existing data on variation in temperature, phytoplankton abundance, metabolic costs, growth rates and predator behavior are used to parameterize the model. The model predicts that krill will shrink when experiencing extreme temperatures or food deprivation (under negative energy budgets), but we also predict that krill may shrink due to predation risk (under positive energy budgets). Furthermore, predation patterns are predicted to strongly influence krill size and spatial distributions. If predation risk is size-dependent, krill are predicted to shrink between reproductive events which reduces predation. Differences between habitats in predation risk may cause krill, to shift away from risky habitats even if this slows growth. In the presence of predation risk when feeding, krill are predicted to experience a tradeoff between growth and survival and shift their feeding behavior and habitat distribution accordingly. Differences between habitats in water temperature and travel costs are also predicted to cause size-dependent shifts in habitat use and migration behavior. Our results reinforce the importance of predator behavior on krill life histories, growth, and distributions. Patterns of predation risk may be the key to understanding krill distribution in space, time and size.									36	0	1	0	31	0	37			0171-8630			WOS:000166834500017		
J	Scheffer, Annette; Trathan, Philip N.; Edmonston, Johnnie G.; Bost, Charles-Andre								Combined influence of meso-scale circulation and bathymetry on the foraging behaviour of a diving predator, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus)								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				141				1	16		10.1016/j.pocean.2015.10.005				FEB 2016	2016	Investigating the responses of marine predators to environmental features is of key importance for understanding their foraging behaviour and reproductive success. In this study we examined the foraging behaviour of king penguins breeding at Kerguelen (southern Indian Ocean) in relation to oceanographic and bathymetric features within their foraging ambit. We used ARGOS and Global Positioning System tracking together with Time-Depth-Temperature-Recorders (TDR) to follow the at-sea movements of incubating and brooding king penguins. Combining the penguin behaviour with oceanographic data at the surface through satellite data and at depth through in-situ recordings by the TDRs enabled us to explore how these predators adjusted their horizontal and vertical foraging movements in response to their physical environment. Relating the observed behaviour and oceanographic patterns to local bathymetry lead to a comprehensive picture of the combined influence of bathymetry and meso-scale circulation on the foraging behaviour of king penguins.During both breeding stages king penguins foraged in the area to the south-east of Kerguelen, where they explored an influx of cold waters of southern origin interacting with the Kerguelen Plateau bathymetry. Foraging in the Polar Front and at the thermocline was associated with high prey capture rates. However, foraging trip orientation and water mass utilization suggested that bathymetrically entrained cold-water features provided the most favourable foraging locations. Our study explicitly reports the exploration of bathymetry-related oceanographic features by foraging king penguins. It confirms the presence of Areas of Ecological Significance for marine predators on the Kerguelen Plateau, and suggests the importance of further areas related to the cold-water flow along the shelf break of the Kerguelen Plateau.

J	Vlietstra, Lucy S.								Seasonal Abundance of the Ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in Relation to Water Temperature and Other Zooplankton in the Thames River Estuary, Connecticut								NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST				21	3			397	418		10.1656/045.021.0307				SEP 2014	2014	I examined seasonal patterns in the abundance of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (Atlantic Comb Jelly) to determine whether unusually early ctenophore blooms occur outside the range in which they were originally reported (Narragansett Bay, RI) and whether ctenophore abundance is correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) or with declines in zooplankton prey. Sampling was conducted from 23 April to 16 November 2004 in the Thames River Estuary, CT. Adult (>= 1 cm) ctenophores first appeared in the estuary on 20 May 2004, with a seasonal peak in mean (+/- SD) density (9.9 +/- 2.5 individuals m(-3), n = 7 stations) and biovolume (26.6 +/- 9.9 m(-3), n = 7 stations) on 9 July 2004. Adult Atlantic Comb Jelly abundance was positively correlated with SST, but only during the spring and early summer. Food availability also likely played an important role in ctenophore-population growth early in the year. However. I observed a delay between copepod density and ctenophore biovolume, possibly due to unusually cold winter temperatures that reduced ctenophore survivorship in the months preceding the study. Ctenophore diets in 2004 consisted primarily of copepods. I observed an inverse correlation between ctenophore biovolume and copepod density, but my data suggest that adult Atlantic Comb Jellies consumed only 0.0-2.2% of the copepod standing stock per day. Overall, my results arc consistent with the hypothesis that early summer ctenophore blooms occured over a relatively large spatial scale; however, trophic impacts in the Thames River Estuary in 2004 appeared to be relatively low.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1092-6194	1938-5307		WOS:000342488400010

Mangroves alter predator-prey interactions by enhancing prey refuge value in a mangrove-marsh ecotone								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				526						151336	10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151336				MAY 2020	2020	Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) are becoming more common along the edges of their range, potentially displacing salt marsh vegetation in transition zones such as the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico (USA). Consequences of this shift on trophic interactions within wetland ecosystems are largely unknown. We investigated how increasing mangrove cover might alter predator-prey interactions involving an important consumer in coastal wetlands, blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), and one of their key prey items, penaeid shrimp (Family Penaeidae). We conducted a series of mesocosm experiments to assess predation rates and prey refuge values in artificial vegetation (AV) matrices simulating flexible marsh grasses (e.g., Spartina patens, Distichlis spicata) and rigid mangrove pneumatophores (aerial root structures). In predation experiments within each of these AV matrices, blue crabs captured 50% fewer penaeid shrimp in the rigid mangrove treatment compared to the flexible marsh treatment, and time between captures was 83% longer among the simulated pneumatophores. In a prey refuge experiment that allowed both predator and prey to move freely among the AV matrices, penaeid shrimp occupied the rigid pneumatophore matrix 30% more often than the grass matrix when blue crabs were present but had no preference when the predator was absent. This study suggests that where A. germinans and marsh grasses co-occur, the mangroves may provide superior refuge for prey items such as penaeid shrimp. Pneumatophores will likely restrict the mobility of predators such as blue crabs, resulting in lower predation efficiency. These results suggest that as mangrove stands continue to increase in cover within mangrove-marsh ecotones, there are likely to be consequences for upper trophic level dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0981	1879-1697		WOS:000528044300013

In many petrels that feed on patchily distributed prey from the sea surface over large foraging areas, alternating long and short foraging trips are used to balance the demands of the chick with the requirements of maintaining adult body condition. When the local conditions are favourable for prey density and quality, adults should be able to reduce the number of long foraging trips. We studied the flexibility in foraging trip lengths of a small pelagic petrel, the thin-billed prion Pachyptila belcheri, over three breeding seasons with increasingly favourable, cold-water conditions. During a warm-water influx in February 2006, chicks were fed less frequently and adults carried out foraging trips of up to 8 days. When conditions became more favourable with colder water temperatures in 2007 and 2008, thin-billed prions decreased trip lengths, more often attended their chick every day, and long foraging trips of six to eight days were not registered during 2008. Chick growth rates mirrored this, as chicks grew poorly during 2006, intermediate during 2007 and best during 2008. Thin-billed prions preyed mainly on squid during incubation and mainly on amphipods and euphausiids during chick-rearing. In the poorest season only, the diet was substantially supplemented with very small copepods. Together, the present results indicate that during warm-water conditions, thin-billed prions had difficulties in finding sufficient squid, amphipods or euphausiids and were forced to switch to lower trophic level prey, which they had to search for over large ocean areas.									18	0	0	0	17	0	19			0025-3162			WOS:000281012700013

Recent studies indicate the consumptive effects of large reef predators are too diffuse to elicit trophic cascades. Here, we provide evidence that such predators can produce non-consumptive (fear) effects that flow through herbivores to shape the distribution of seaweed on a coral reef. This trophic cascade emerged because reef topography, tidal oscillations, and shark hunting behaviour interact to create predictable "hot spots" of fear on the reef where herbivores withhold feeding and seaweeds gain a spatial refuge. Thus, in risky habitats, sharks can exert strong ecological impacts even though they are trophic generalists that rarely feed. These findings contextualize the debate over whether predators influence coral reef structure and function and move us to ask not if, but under what specific conditions, they generate trophic cascades.									26	0	0	0	24	0	26			2045-2322			WOS:000415282300003	29146986

We investigated the interactive effects of fishing and harmful algal blooms on the predator-sea urchin-macroalgae trophic cascade. Fishing of urchin predators had indirect negative effects on macroalgae, whereas blooms of epi-benthic dinoflagellates (Ostreopsis siamensis) were found to have strong negative effects on urchins and indirect positive effects on macroalgae. Based on these opposing effects, blooms were expected to counteract the cascading effects of fishing. However, a large bloom of Ostreopsis led to greater divergence in macroalgae abundance between reserve and fished sites, as urchins declined at reserve sites but remained stable at fished sites. This resulted from enhanced predation rates on bloom-affected urchins at reserve sites rather than direct lethal effects of Ostreopsis on urchins. We argue that interacting stressors can facilitate or attenuate trophic cascades depending on stressor intensity and complex non-lethal interactions.									49	0	0	0	47	0	50			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000281134800009	20618840

Sea water samples were collected every hours to evaluate time-related variations of phytoplankton concentrations and to compare the relative ratio of A. catenella versus other phytoplankton species during the outbreak. From these observations, trials using recirculated sea water systems were performed to: i) evaluate the physiological effects on oyster of increasing proportions of A. catenella within a mixed microalgal diet where the non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii was present at concentration: 1500 cells ml(-1), ii) compare the effect of two temperatures (12 degrees C and 18 degrees C) on paralytic toxin accumulation rates in oyster flesh by ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) detection, iii) analyse toxin biotransformation during the contamination process, iv) evaluate the role of the different types of oyster tissue on the bioaccumulation mechanism.The results showed: i) a significant e. ect of temperature increase on clearance rate and toxin uptake, ii) no detectable time-related effects of toxic algal food on pre-ingestion sorting or on toxin profiles in oyster flesh, iii) either negative or positive effects of A. catenella concentrations on toxin uptake ("threshold" effect), iv) high amounts of toxins in the digestive gland, accounting for more than 80% of overall shellfish toxicity. The daily amount of toxins (Q(tox)) taken up by each oyster was evaluated by means of a global one-compartment model. However a two-compartment model finally gave the best match with real contamination kinetics, since it integrated both toxins sequestered in oyster tissues and toxins moving in through the digestive tract.

The primary hosts are lodgepole and ponderosa pines. Recent rising temperatures, however, have allowed these beetles to survive at higher elevations more commonly than in the past, thus threatening whitebark pine, a keystone species of high elevation ecosystems and a highly susceptible host. 2 The extent to which risk in whitebark pine stands may be mitigated by predators or competitors is unknown. We compared the communities of coleopteran predators and competitors of D. ponderosae in sites of varying elevation and species composition in Montana and Wyoming, U. S. A. Sites were selected for low to moderate levels of tree mortality, where the potential of natural enemies to prevent D. ponderosae from transitioning into outbreaks would bemost relevant. Insect populations were evaluated using unbaited flight- intercept panel traps and pheromone- baitedmultiple funnel traps. 3 Only the predatory beetle species Thanasimus undatulus ( Coleoptera: Cleridae) was captured in these non- outbreak stands. Based on the pheromone- baited traps, predator load was higher at low- elevation stands dominated by lodgepole pine than high- elevation stands dominated by whitebark pine. 4 Phloeophagous insects were more prevalent in the mid- and higher- elevation sites, although most of the species captured would not likely compete substantially for resources with D. ponderosae. We also observed differences in species assemblages between the Montana and Wyoming sites, as well as differing utilities of baited and unbaited traps at low versus moderate tree mortality levels.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000437101800009

We used an age-structured population model to compare population growth rates (lambda) between a simulated population that included invasive Northern Snakehead (NSH) Channa argus as a competitor and predator and a simulated population that did not. We then assessed the sensitivity of our results to natural variation in LMB recruitment. When recruitment of LMB was already poor, there was a high risk of population decline that did not depend on whether NSH was included in the model scenario. When recruitment of LMB was high, the risk of population decline was only 40% when NSH was not included in the model scenario; however, predation by and competition with NSH caused a higher risk of LMB population decline. Regardless of the level of LMB recruitment, the size of the LMB population at equilibrium was 20% lower (on average) when including NSH in the model. We conclude that when habitat conditions do not already significantly limit recruitment, populations of LMB may be adversely affected by cohabitation with NSH. Preventing the spread of NSH will lessen ecosystem pressures that negatively affect the LMB population. We encourage continued vigilance in conserving LMB populations by encouraging actions that promote recruitment and prevent spread of invasive species.

Previous studies have shown a long-term decline in the size of 0-group sandeels in the western North Sea, but they were unable to pinpoint the mechanism (later hatching, slower growth or changes in size-dependent mortality) or cause. To investigate the first 2 possibilities we combined 2 independent time series of sandeel size, namely data from chick-feeding Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica and from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), in a novel statistical model implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The model estimated annual mean length on 1 July, as well as hatching date and growth rate for sandeels from 1973 to 2006. Mean length-at-date declined by 22% over this period, corresponding to a 60% decrease in energy content, with a sharper decline since 2002. Up to the mid-1990s, the decline was associated with a trend towards later hatching. Subsequently, hatching became earlier again, and the continued trend towards smaller size appears to have been driven by lower growth rates, particularly in the most recent years, although we could not rule out changes in size-dependent mortality. Our findings point to major changes in key aspects of sandeel life history, which we consider are most likely due to direct and indirect temperature-related changes over a range of biotic factors, including the seasonal distribution of copepods and intra-and inter-specific competition with planktivorous fish. The results have implications both for the many predators of sandeels and for age and size of maturation in this aggregation of North Sea sandeels.									22	0	0	0	21	0	22			0171-8630			WOS:000292163200012

Food demands of the predatory carabid Notiophilus biguttatus F. and their fulfilment were studied in the laboratory and field.2. In the laboratory, larval consumption, growth, adult body size and egg production were established for different regimes of temperature and food, the springtail Orchesella cincta.3. Temperature strongly influenced feeding rate of larvae and adults and consequently growth and oviposition rates. Accordingly, growth rate and oviposition rate increased with prey supply.4. Prey supply also had an effect on fat content, but the number of ripe eggs in the ovaries was related neither to temperature nor to prey supply.5. Adult body size was affected by temperature during the larval period but more so by food supply.6. Dissection of field fresh females showed them to bear eggs for the whole year, except in late winter/early spring and in July.7. Fat content was low in spring and, from July on, high in summer and autumn. Survivorship during starvation differed widely between samples and seemed to be related to reproductive status rather than to fat content.8. Samples of beetles and springtails from eleven pine plantations revealed for the beetles significant differences in fat content and body size, the latter ranging between the maximum and minimum value obtained in the laboratory.9. Conclusions about food limitation based on body size and fat content were not corroborated by a relationship of these indices with springtail density.									42	0	2	0	40	0	44			0307-6946			WOS:A1992HL13100005

J	Riley, Megan E.; Vogel, Margaret; Griffen, Blaine D.								Fitness-associated consequences of an omnivorous diet for the mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii								AQUATIC BIOLOGY				20	1			35	43		10.3354/ab00543				2014	2014	Omnivory is a widespread trophic strategy with variable impacts on survival and reproduction, even within closely related taxonomic groups. In coastal ecosystems experiencing extensive environmental changes, many decapod crustaceans employ omnivorous feeding strategies. Because animals initially respond to environmental changes with behavioral modifications that can alter their foraging habits, a mechanistic understanding of how diet influences fitness is essential to predict the impact of future environmental changes on species fitness and population dynamics. We investigated the impact of an omnivorous diet on the consumption, survivorship, physiological condition, and reproductive effort of the mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii, a major mangrove consumer. A. pisonii engaged in compensatory feeding on plant material; crabs consumed more food and digested it less efficiently as the proportion of plant material in their diet increased. Although there were relatively few deaths, survival appeared to be negatively impacted by the consumption of large quantities of animal material and marginally negatively influenced by high levels of plant consumption. Physiological condition improved due to consumption of both plant and animal material, while only consumption of animal material increased reproductive investment. These results demonstrate that the opportunistic inclusion of animal material in the diet of A. pisonii significantly improves physiological condition and reproductive effort, and suggests that vitellogenic individuals cannot fully compensate for a lack of animal material in their diet by increasing plant consumption. This study provides a mechanistic framework to understand how potential diet changes by omnivorous crabs such as A. pisonii, which are facing numerous changes in their environment, may impact their fitness and population dynamics.									13	0	1	0	14	1	14			1864-7790	1864-7782		WOS:000330614600004

Previous studies have suggested that the reproductive rate is tightly coupled to the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), which has been shown to respond to ecosystem regime shifts associated with decadal-scale climate forcing from the Arctic. Given the endangered status of the right whale population, it is vital to determine how climate-associated changes in prey availability will affect this species in the future. Here, we investigate a 3-state reproduction model that explores multiple environmental proxies as potential predictors of annual calf production during the period from 1980 to 2007. The model achieves its best fit to observations using temporally and spatially resolved C. finmarchicus abundance data derived from Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) surveys of the GOM. Building on previous research, this prey-dependent model, which uses bimonthly and geographically specific abundance anomalies of C. finmarchicus, significantly improves estimates of annual calf production relative to a null model. The temporal and geographic distributions of prey objectively chosen for inclusion in the new version of the model correspond well with observed right whale seasonal distribution patterns, providing further evidence that the model captures essential features of right whale reproductive ecology.									21	0	0	0	19	0	22			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000361694000017

The amount of food ingested fluctuated but two significant decreases in ingestion occurred during each sigmoid growth cycle corresponding to the completion of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, respectively. The major determinant of the biomass asymptotes is the high energy costs of respiration in sexually mature animals, with the production of mature ova associated with the deceleration of growth. Changes in energy balance during reproduction is forwarded as an explanation for the primary semelparity of N. obscura in the field and its iteroparity under optimal conditions. Post-reproductive. mortality is associated with both significant metabolic costs incurred during gametogenesis and the energetic costs of reproductive output.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0003-9136			WOS:A1996VX58800004

However, elevational clines in body size in the mountain dusky salamander Desmognathus ocoee (family Plethodontidae) shift from positive at hatching, to negative at metamorphosis to positive again as adults, and so are not consistent with this explanation. The clinal shift from hatching to metamorphosis was investigated by examining the clinal and seasonal feeding patterns of larval salamanders at high and low elevation sites in rockface and woodland habitats. Repeated cohort sampling was also used to examine clinal and seasonal patterns in body size and to estimate average growth rates. Larval growth in both rockface and woodland habitats was tightly correlated with feeding activity. Although temperature was found to vary between high and low elevation sites, the greatest growth occurred in a cold woodland habitat with a high elevation, and the lowest growth occurred in an adjacent rockface habitat. Because this difference in growth cannot be attributed to thermal differences, we conclude that local food resource levels are the predominant source of local differences in growth. These findings, clinal patterns of variation in other predatory salamanders, and experimental analyses in which both food and temperature are orthogonally manipulated, indicate that general models that single out temperature as the principle cause of ectotherm life-history clines should be viewed with caution.									17	0	0	0	18	0	19			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000182607300009

Although E has recently been shown to vary systematically, we have a poor understanding of its ecological significance. To address this question, we conducted a common-garden experiment involving six damselfly species differing in distribution, estimating E at the level of full-sib families. Each species was sampled throughout its latitudinal range, allowing us to characterise variation in E along a latitudinal gradient spanning 3600 km. We show that E differs among populations and increases with latitude. E was right-skewness across species, but this was largely an artefact of the latitudinal trend. Increased seasonality towards higher latitude may contribute to the latitudinal trend in E. We conclude that E should be seen as a trait involved in local adaptation.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000312301300008	23050790

However, these two population contexts have mostly been considered separately. Moreover, because the sensitivity of the different pathways of energy to stress may differ, it is difficult to predict combined stressor effects. We used an agent-based model of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to infer the population-level impacts of a hypothetical, sublethal stressor that affects an individual's metabolism (growth, reproduction, maintenance, or assimilation) in systems in which population size is controlled by different combinations of food availability and predation. We found that population-level effects are rarely directly proportional to individual-level effects, and were greater when the stressor impacted assimilation and populations were predation-controlled. Our results suggest that individual level measurements alone are insufficient for inferring population-level impacts of stressors and that accurate inference hinges on insight into how populations are regulated. We suggest incorporating individual-level data into mechanistic models that take into account both the energy budgets of individuals and the population-level									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000514022500017

Both abiotic and biotic factors are thought to influence migratory behavior, but their relative roles are difficult to disentangle. For migratory marine predators, both temperature and prey availability have been shown to be significant predictors of space use, though often researchers rely on physical proxies due to the lack of data on dynamic prey fields. We generated spatially explicit individual-based movement models to evaluate the relative roles of abiotic (sea surface temperature; SST) and biotic (prey availability) factors in driving blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) movement decisions and migratory behavior in the eastern North Pacific. Using output from a lower trophic ecosystem model coupled with a regional ocean circulation model, we parameterized a blue whale movement model that explicitly incorporates prey fields in addition to physical proxies. A model using both SST and prey data reproduced blue whale foraging behavior including realistic timing of latitudinal migrations. SST-and prey-only population models demonstrated important independent effects of each variable. In particular, the SST-only model revealed that warm temperatures limited krill foraging opportunities but failed to drive seasonal foraging patterns, whereas the prey-only model revealed more realistic seasonal and interannual differences in foraging behavior. Our individual-based movement model helps elucidate the mechanisms underlying migration and demonstrates how fine-scale individual decision-making can lead to emergent migratory behavior at the population level. Moreover, determining the relative effects of the physical environment and prey availability on the movement decisions of threatened species is critical to understand how they may respond to changing ocean conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000558027100009

Migratory timing, marine survival and growth of anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta in the River Imsa, Norway								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				74	3			621	638		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02152.x				FEB 2009	2009	The aim of the paper was to study sea migration, growth and survival of brown trout Salmo trutta of the River Imsa, 1976-2005. The migratory S. trutta were individually tagged and fish leaving or entering the river were monitored daily in traps located near the river mouth. The mean annual duration of the sea sojourn was 6-9 months for first-time migrants moving to sea between January and June. It was 8-18 months for those migrating to sea between July and December. Veteran migrants stayed 12 months or less at sea and most returned to the river in August. Early ascending fish stayed the longest in fresh water because most returned to sea in April to May. The day number of 50% cumulative smolt descent correlated negatively with mean water temperature in February to March and the February North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAOI). Mean annual sea growth during the first 2 years after smolting was higher for S. trutta spending the winter at sea than those wintering in the River Imsa. First year's sea growth was lower for S. trutta descending in spring than autumn. For first-time migrants, it correlated negatively with the February NAOI of the smolt year. Sea survival was higher for spring than autumn descending first-time migratory S. trutta with a maximum in May (14.9%). Number of anadromous S. trutta returning to the river increased linearly with the size of the cohort moving to sea, with no evidence of density-dependent sea mortality. Sea survival of S. trutta smolts moving to sea between January and June correlated positively both with the annual number of Atlantic Salmo salar smolts, the specific growth rate at sea, and time of seaward migration in spring. This is the first study indicating how environmental factors at the time of seaward migration influence the sea survival of S. trutta.									62	0	1	0	59	1	63			0022-1112	1095-8649		WOS:000263040100010	20735583

The cage was fixed with three cylindrical nets; inner net of 2 mm mesh (6 m diax5.5 m height) to rear post-larvae from stock to 80th day; middle net of 10 mm mesh (6 mx5.5 m) to rear juveniles from day 81 onwards and an outer net of 40 mm mesh (8 m diax4.5 m height) to prevent entry of predators. Post-larvae (PL23) of P. monodon (mean total length 16.1 +/- 3.8 mm), were stocked in the cage at a density of 1179 PL m(-3)). Bottom water parameters viz., salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and ammonia (NH3-N) recorded in the cage site during the culture period were 34-35 ppt, 26-32 degrees C, 3.9-4.6 ml l(-1), 8.1-8.3 and 0.05-0.07 mg l(-1), respectively. Shrimp feed varying in size suitable to different growth stages, was used during the trial. Feed was given twice during the first 20 days and thrice during 21-99 days. Feeding rate per day ranged from 133.3% of the biomass of shrimp at stocking time to 3.1% of the biomass of shrimp at preharvest. P. monodon registered a growth rate of 0.87 mm (TL)/0.018 g (wt) per day during first 30 days; 0.89 mm/0.069 g per day during 31-60 days and 0.37 mm/0.051 g per day during 61-90 days. On day 100, about 207 kg of shrimp (production rate, 1.62 kg m(-3)) was harvested and the mean size of harvested shrimp was 81.54 +/- 15.20 mm TL/4.50 +/- 2.80 g wt. Survival recorded was 31.4% and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 3.97. Present study demonstrated the possibility for culture of P. monodon in open sea floating cage.

This study examined the effect of temperature on the sex ratio, longevity, oviposition periods, fecundity and life table parameters of the predatory thrips Scolothrips longicornis Priesner (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) fed on twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), at six constant temperatures: 15, 20, 26, 30, 35, and 37 degrees C. Approximately 75% of the progeny were female, except at 37 degrees C, at which temperature the proportion of males increased. Adult longevity as well as the preoviposition, oviposition, and postoviposition periods decreased significantly with temperature. Thus, adults lived for approximate to 5 wk at 15 degrees C and <1wk at 37 degrees C with preoviposition, oviposition, and postoviposition periods ranging from 6.4 to 0.4, 24.4-3.1, and 7-0.8 d between the two temperature extremes, respectively. The maximum (56.48 eggs) and minimum (11.69 eggs) value of total fecundity was recorded at 26 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) of S. longicornis increased linearly with increasing temperature from 0.056 d(-1) at 15 degrees C to 0.310 d(-1) at 35 degrees C. The lower temperature threshold for the population increase of S. longicornis was estimated to be around 5 degrees C. The data suggest that the upper temperature threshold for the predatory thrips is approximate to 37 degrees C. The results showed that populations of S. longicornis are able to develop at a broad range of temperatures and that this predator is well adapted to the high temperatures that occur in the Mediterranean region.									21	1	0	0	21	0	22			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000294118500012	21735896

The objective of this research was to model the relationship between seasonal changes in arthropod abundance and weather variables using data from a collaborative pan-Canadian (Southampton, Herschel, Bylot, and Ellesmere Islands) study on terrestrial arthropods. Arthropods were captured with passive traps that provided a combined measure of abundance and activity (a proxy for arthropod availability to foraging birds). We found that 70% of the deviance in daily arthropod availability was explained by three temperature covariates: mean daily temperature, thaw degree-day, and thaw degree-day(2). Models had an adjusted R-2 of 0.29-0.95 with an average among sites and arthropod families of 0.67. This indicates a moderate to strong fit to the raw data. The models for arthropod families with synchronous emergence, such as Tipulidae (Diptera), had a better fit (average adjusted R-2 of 0.80) than less synchronous taxa, such as Araneae (R-2 = 0.60). Arthropod abundance was typically higher in wet than in mesic habitats. Our models will serve as tools for researchers who want to correlate insectivorous bird breeding data to arthropod availability in the Canadian Arctic.									33	0	0	0	32	0	35			0008-347X	1918-3240		WOS:000316611300004
